And especially nice to wipe out Minnesota, too bad they weren’t knocked out of the tourney altogether. Why the hatred for the hapless Gophers? It all goes back to <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085766/index.htm">this incident</a>, which pretty much flattened the OSU program for the next 10 years and ended Witte’s career. The Minnesota thugs got wrist slaps, Winfield went on to a successful baseball career which always galled me.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping the Gophers flame out in their first game.</p>
