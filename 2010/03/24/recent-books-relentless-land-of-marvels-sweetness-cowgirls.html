<ul>
  <li>“Relentless”:amazon by Dean Koontz. Koontz writes light horror books – humorous, at times scary, a little grotesque, ultimately uplifting. He seems like he’d be a nice guy to have lunch with. Amazon says 3.5 stars, sounds right.</li>
  <li>“Land of Marvels”:amazon by Barry Unsworth. Lust in all it’s forms – for a woman, for glory, for power, for money, for empire – collide in pre WWI Mesopotamia with predictably disastrous results. Good but not great tale. Amazon says 4 stars, might be a bit rich.</li>
  <li>“The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie”:amazon by Alan Bradley. Excellent mystery starring a very unusual precocious 11-year-old detective. Not very believable but I was totally sucked in. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I loved the book.</li>
  <li>“Even Cowgirls Get the Blues”: amazon by Tom Robbins. I hate farce and so didn’t finish this. I tried. It does seem well written but I can’t get past the absurdity. Amazon says 3.5 stars, I’d say .5.</li>
