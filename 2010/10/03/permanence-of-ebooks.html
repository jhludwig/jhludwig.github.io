<p>So I am starting to read a new book on my Kindle and just after the Library of Congress info I see that:</p>

<p>“The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the American National Standard for Information Sciences–Permanence of Paper for Printed Library Materials, ANSI Z39.48-1992.”</p>

<p>Good to know.</p>
