<p>* “A Reliable Wife”:amazon by Robert Goolrick. You know what sucks? Sending away for a mail order bride, only to discover she is your estranged son’s lover and has come to poison you, and so you allow her to do so, believing it will provide absolution for how you treated your son, and then things get really complicated. Cures you of nostalgia for the good old days. Amazon says only 3 stars but I found it much more compelling. * “Flight from Monticello”:amazon by Michael Kranish. The tale of Jefferson’s days as governer of Virgina during the Revolutionary War. Makes you wonder just how we won the war, given the general ineptness of the Virginia government. And certainly makes you question the moral basis for the war – we were fighting to preserve the Virginia slave economy? Amazon says 4.5 stars, it is a very good book. I’d love to read a British perspective of the war after reading this…</p>
