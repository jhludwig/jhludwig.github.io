<p>I’m using my iPad to remotely login to an XP machine at UW to run ANSYS, which still feels exactly like ANSYS from the 70s: painful syntax, all upper case, incredibly modal. Takes me way back – card punch machines, pin feed dot matrix printers, disk packs, paper tape. Man those were the days.</p>

<p>Will we still be running ANSYS in another 40 years?</p>
