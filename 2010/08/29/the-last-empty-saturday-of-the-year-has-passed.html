<p>…College football kicks off this week! Finally.</p>

<p>Getting ready for the season:</p>

<p>* “Live odds”:http://www.bangthebook.com/football-betting/live-football-odds.php. Not that I bet, nor do I believe that odds have much to do with expected outcomes, but still interesting to peruse. * “CFB stats”:http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/ – awesome site with comprehensive stats. For when you need to spew them at someone to prove your school is better. * “Senator Tressel held in high regard by coaching ranks”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/collegesports/2012722914_survey29.html?syndication=rss. Pretty awesome. * “Blogpoll”:http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/rankings/college-football-blogpoll-top-25.</p>
