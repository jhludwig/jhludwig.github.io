<p>Season kicks off tomorrow, so let’s class up the joint:</p>

<p>_<strong>American Football by Harold Pinter</strong></p>

<p>Hallelullah! It works. We blew the shit out of them.</p>

<p>We blew the shit right back up their own ass And out their fucking ears.</p>

<p>It works. We blew the shit out of them. They suffocated in their own shit!</p>

<p>Hallelullah. Praise the Lord for all good things.</p>

<p>We blew them into fucking shit. They are eating it.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord for all good things.</p>

<p>We blew their balls into shards of dust, Into shards of fucking dust.</p>

<p>We did it.</p>

<p>Now I want you to come over here and kiss me on the mouth._</p>

<p>Awesome on so many levels. From “HaroldPinter.org”:http://www.haroldpinter.org/poetry/poetry_football.shtml, worth reading the discussion there.</p>
