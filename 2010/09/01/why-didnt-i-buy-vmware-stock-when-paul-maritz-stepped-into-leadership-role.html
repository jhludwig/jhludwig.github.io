<p>Kicking myself totally on this one, “VMWare”:http://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NYSE:VMW has been on a tear. Paul is a great guy, he has been hiring great guys (who wouldn’t want to work with Paul?), they’ve been acquiring lots of interesting assets. And fundamentally they are on the right side of history. Paul has always been insightful and articulate on strategy and he says it well in this “techcrunch piece”:http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2010/09/paul_maritz_microsoft_vet_and_vmware_ceo_spars_with_his_former_self.html : <em>“The innovation in how hardware is coordinated today and the innovation in how services are provided to applications is no longer happening inside the operating system.”</em></p>

<p>This is dead on. You can debate whether VMWare will be the primary beneficiary of this trend versus other cloud providers, but the shift is undeniable.</p>
