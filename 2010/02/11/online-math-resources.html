<p>Just discovered “Cramster”:http://www.cramster.com/. Awesome. If they have coverage for the text used in your class, this is super helpful.</p>

<p>Finding that Wolfram Alpha is also becoming more useful. Easier to run to it to figure out the integral of x^2 sinx sinhx than spinning up mathematica or maple or matlab.</p>
