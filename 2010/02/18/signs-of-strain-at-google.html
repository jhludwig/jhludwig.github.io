<p>OK the missteps that Google has made with Buzz this week are well chronicled. They jammed a product out without really thinking it through.</p>

<p>That doesn’t hit me that much as a user. But today using the iphone map app I am getting continuous errors – here is the map of “drugstores near my current location”:http://twitpic.com/13st7z. Not unique to me, I’ve heard of this from many folks today.</p>

<p>And I’m looking at the ESPN boxscore page for “Purdue/OSU right now”:http://espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=300480194 and first the google toolbar tells me it is in Portuguese, and now in Catalan, and asks if I want a translation.</p>

<p>One wonders if Google is spreading itself a little thin.</p>
