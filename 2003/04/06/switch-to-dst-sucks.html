<p>The switch to <a href="http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/" title="About Daylight Saving Time - History, rationale, laws &amp; dates">Daylight Saving Time</a> sucks. Losing an hour on a Sunday is no fun. C had a great point – why doesn’t the switch happen on a monday late morning or early afternoon? Would any of us regret giving up an hour on monday? Why does it need to be taken out of the weekend?</p>
