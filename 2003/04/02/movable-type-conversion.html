<p>Finally moving to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" title="movabletype.org">movabletype.org</a>. The loss of my Haloscan comments pushed me over the edge tho I had wanted to move for a while.</p>

<p>A real pain to get it working on Win2k/IIS. The default settings of URLSCAN are broken with MT. and the default security settings of IIS are not so great either. A lot of dorking around to get IIS and MT to coexist nicely – as you can tell by my lack of posts for a week or so.</p>

<p>I’ll be bringing old posts over slowly as I put some category tags and do other cleanup on them. And then I need to integrate my blogroll, playlist, and other features from my blogger blog.</p>
