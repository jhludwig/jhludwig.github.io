<p><strong>Pneumatic Circuit Software</strong>. I’m trying to find some software to help me calculate loads, capacities, latencies in pneumatic circuits. Up at <a href="http://fluid.power.net">FluidPower.net</a> they have lots of pointers to various packages but they seem more academic and less engineering-oriented, or they are expensive industrial control packages. <a href="http://www.automationstudio.com/english/html/professional/">Automation Studio</a> looks pretty cool actually – but there is no price listed, you have to contact them for a quote, that means \(\)$. Autocad has pneumatic symbols but it doesn’t look to me like it does the calculations (and I don’t want to pay that much). Nothing on <a href="http://www.download.com">download.com</a>, nothing on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">sourceforge.net</a>. There must be some cheapo package somewhere that universities use – couldn’t find much tho at the <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/forster/classes/me333/">UW fluid mechanics course site</a>. I guess I have to calculate my Halloween circuits by hand – I am going to have 10 loads of various sorts with various duty cycles, I was hoping for some software that would calculate reservoir tank needs and compressor size needed based on input configuration, duty cycles, cylinder sizes, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.festo.com/INetDomino/coorp_sites/en/8157963c12bb991cc1256b570034a693.htm">Fluidraw</a> is another option I just found. Seems to be more a drawing package tho than an analysis package. But a good site on pneumatics.</p>
