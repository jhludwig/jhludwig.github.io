<p><strong>Peter Lewis on Convergence.</strong> In <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/ontech/">Fortune.com</a>, Peter states the case that convergence is more of a vendor dream and not really an end user demand, and hence it is not really likely to happen. I’d agree mostly. I actually think we are headed for a world of data/network convergence, but device divergence. It is getting cheaper and cheaper to make all kinds of devices, thanks to contract manufacture, contract design, better supply chain management, build to order, etc. So I think we’ll see more kinds of devices, not fewer. But the devices that win will be the ones that support standard protocols and data formats out the back side, so that my data can be used anywhere, is portable to my next device, is viewable from other devices, etc.</p>
