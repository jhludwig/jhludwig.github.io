<p><strong>Activewords</strong>. An interesting idea, I could use system-wide macros – <a href="http://www.activewords.com/">ActiveWords Home Page</a>. But I had to uninstall, it seemed a little too aggressive at capturing keystrokes, there were times when i couldn’t seem to type anything into any program, Activewords was eating everything. Too bad.</p>
