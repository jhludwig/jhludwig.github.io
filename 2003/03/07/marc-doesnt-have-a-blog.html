<p><strong>Marc doesn’t have a blog</strong>. Via <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/03/06#When:8:32:14AM">Scripting News</a>, marca doesn’t have the “time or ego need” for a blog. My paltry traffic level certainly doesn’t result in an ego boost! And I get great payback on time spent. Maybe marc is worried that his postings can’t stand up to the full light of day (obviously that hasn’t stopped me).</p>
