<p><strong>PMA 2003 Software announcements</strong>. A quick review of these – <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0303/03030207minoltamessenger.asp">Minolta Messenger</a> lets you add hotspots to photos, an idea we were kicking around yesterday. Not sure it is worth a whole separate app! <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/adobephotoshopalbum/">Adobe Album</a> gets lots of press – I hear it blows chunks on large data sets. <a href="http://www.preclick.com/index.php">Preclick</a> gets some nice press, I am downloading now. It is pretty fast at importing my pictures (about 2000). And it is very fast navigating thru photos – this may win the speed war! but it has very limited org tools, it is just a reflection of what folders you have created in the filesystem, and then you can add ratings to photos. it has a fast search feature but i think it only searches on titles. and has an “autofix” feature as its only real editting tool – i kind of like the simplicity here. <a href="http://www.ddisoftware.com/qimage/">Qimage</a> is supposed to be a killer printing program for photos – looks kind of geeky. Ulead announced its <a href="http://www.ulead.com/dps/runme.htm">latest</a> -- I’ve never been overwhelmed with Ulead product quality but worth looking at I guess.</p>
