<p><strong>Web Album Generator</strong>. I’ve blogged this before but I saw another mention of it – <a href="http://www.ornj.net/software/webalbum/index.html">ornj.net - Web Album Generator</a> – I need to try it out this weekend. OK I tried it out. Makes pretty clean pages. But a pain to import photos, and the pages are static so updating will be a pain. Not the right solution.</p>
