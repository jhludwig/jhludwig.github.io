<p><strong>Controlling solenoids</strong>. As i plan my pneumatic system, I need some way to control my solenoids. I am thinking about possibly a midi-based system, and need a device that converts midi wiring/protocol to the 12/24v required by most solenoids. <a href="http://www.mediamat.com/">Mediamation</a> seems to make such gear. Another one from <a href="http://www.laserium.com/hardware/MIDIana.html">Laserium</a> tho it only support signals up to 10V. The Gilderfluke <a href="http://www.gilderfluke.com/gilderflukepsfiles/CutSheets/SER-DMX.pdf">Servo controller</a> or <a href="http://www.gilderfluke.com/gilderflukepsfiles/CutSheets/BR-ANA.pdf">analog brick</a> may do the trick, but using DMX digital input instead of MIDI – but this is ok, my control software is native DMX anyway – I have email into gilderfluke requesting advice.</p>

<p>Update: nice mail from the gilderfluke folks:<em>Are your valves analog or digital (just on off)? If they’re analog, then, yes, you are correct. The BR-ANA card will fit the bill. If they’re digital, either the MultiBrick32 or our Zbricks would do nicely. I recommend the more expensive MultiBrick 32 because it has a microprocessor that is able to filter out the occasional bad packet of DMX. If your application doesn’t have a critical need to prevent the occasional “hiccup” (1 or 2 frames worth) and the valves are digital, then the Z-Bricks are a very cost effective solution.</em></p>

<p>Another DMX alternative is a <a href="http://www.dovesystems.com/BuildPage.php?page=mtx">Dove Analog Dimmer</a>. I use Dove dimmers now for my 120V and 240V gear (lighting and fog systems) and I have been happy with their sturdiness. $795 for the unit I want.</p>
