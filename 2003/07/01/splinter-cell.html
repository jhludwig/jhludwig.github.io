<p>I told myself that I was never going to buy a Tom Clancy branded game, because I thought that the games probably sucked, the publisher having spent all their money on the name license.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://www.splintercell.com/us/" title="Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell">Tom Clancyâ€™s Splinter Cell</a> is a seriously good game.</p>
