<p>At Cannon Beach for the last 5-6 days – stayed at the <a href="http://www.theoceanlodge.com/main.html" title="Main Page at the Ocean Lodge">Ocean Lodge</a>. Beautiful new lodge, good service, tho some oddities – stained typewritten hotel guide; a cardboard sign out front naming the hotel; AC in only some of the rooms; very stilted praise of one of the owning partners in the hotel guide. I just got the sense that something odd was going on behind the scenes, there were just enough little details that were askew. Maybe the owning partners are at odds? We’d stay there again, tho the Stephanie Inn right next door is nicer and has none of the odd signs. Weather was great. And of course the beach was the beach, best beach in the Pacific Northwest? Sadly I broke my toe last day of the stay and am now hobbling.</p>
