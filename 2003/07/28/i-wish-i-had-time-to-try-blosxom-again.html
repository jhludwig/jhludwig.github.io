<p>I see that <a href="http://www.raelity.org/archives/computers/internet/weblogs/blosxom/blosxom_2_0.html" title="raelity bytes">Blosxom 2.0</a> has shipped. Claims to have better IIS support than past versions. I wish I had time to try it again because the core design principle – leverage the file system hierarchy as your category hierarchy – is so appealing to me, no new storage system created. As a result, backup, copying, storage management, etc are so much easier. But I just don’t have the time to reimplement the blog again right now. I did play around with previous versions a lot but they were so hard to get working on IIS and NT.</p>
