Owners Fight Back</a> – We drive SUVs in large part because we want the laws governing momentum to play out in our favor in an accident – delta-V is a bad thing for your body. I don’t love having all these big vehicles on the road but I am not going to unilaterally compromise my family’s safety to support a principle. Now I would love to see us as a society remove big heavy vehicles, including semi-trucks, from passenger vehicle roadways, but I am not holding my breath.</p>
