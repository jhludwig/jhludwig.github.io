<p>1) It costs nothing to provide WiFi. If that’s not true, you’re doing it wrong. The billing infrastructure is probably 90% of Starbucks’ cost. So loosen up on access, don’t freak out if somebody finds a hole that gives them free access, and focus on keeping costs down.</p>

<p>2) If users can’t log in and get going in a hurry, your WiFi is useless. You can’t charge a premium *and* provide bad service, and since charging a premium means that you have lock down the system so tightly that it takes a while to log in, don’t do either._ Thanks <a href="http://gary.burd.info/">Gary</a> for the pointer.</p>
