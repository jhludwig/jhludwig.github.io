<p>I picked up a <a href="http://www.sierradesigns.com/cgi-bin/driver.pl?index=2&amp;conf=tent_show_03" title="Sierra Designs : Tents Finder Item View">Sierra Designs Lightyear</a> one man tent last week and used it last weekend. Very happy with the design and weight, tho the assembly instructions are wrong headed. They suggest laying out the tent fabric and staking first, then assembling the poles. It works MUCH better to assemble the poles and attach to the fabric first, and then stake it out.</p>
