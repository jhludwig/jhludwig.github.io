<p>Frank nails it – <a href="http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/000857.html" title="pseudorandom: ">pseudorandom: “A Kind of Cockamamie Sincerity”</a> – we couldn’t stop watching Johnny Depp. Some of us have seen the movie twice now. I want to see all the rest of Johnny’s work now. <em>Pirates</em> may not be the best movie of the summer, but Johnny’s performance is clearly among the best of the year.</p>
