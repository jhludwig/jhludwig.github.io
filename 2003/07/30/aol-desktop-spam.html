<p>B@$tards at AOL spammed my desktop with all kinds of ad links for AOL Broadband, during a minor version upgrade of AOL Instant Messenger. I got a link to <a href="http://free.aol.com/tryaolfree/index.adp?promo=359339&amp;service=aolhsb" title="Welcome to America Online!">AOL Broadband promo site</a> stuffed into my start menu, slammed unto my links toolbar in IE, placed on my desktop, all pointing to some new exe on my machine – GtAOD.exe. I specifically said during intall of the AIM upgrade that I didn’t want any AIM icons spewed onto my system; does AOL really believe that, if I don’t want any AIM icons slammed onto my system (icons for a program that I am agreeing to install and that has real utility for me), that I am somehow OK with AOL Broadband icons slammed everywhere (which are just advertisements, for a service for which I have indicated no interest)? Dorks.</p>
