<p>Just finished a fast read of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0066620996/qid=1059585580/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-6178200-5387869?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't">Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap… and Others Don’t</a>. A solid, reasonable business book with good lessons for all size companies. I especially liked the first step that companies took – getting the right people on board. You don’t start by figuring out the strategy, you start by having a great team, and then build from there. <a href="http://www.horsecentral.com/Default.aspx">Don Bradford</a> recommended this book to me a couple years ago, thanks Don, worth the quick read.</p>
