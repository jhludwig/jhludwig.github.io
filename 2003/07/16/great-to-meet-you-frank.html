<p>Met <a href="http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/000845.html" title="pseudorandom: Meeting John Ludwig">Frank Boosman</a> this week – great guy, anyone who even remotely compares me to Tiger Woods and Yao Ming is ok by me. Oh and by the way there are other great ex-MSFT VCs too – my partners here at <a href="http://www.ignitionpartners.com">Ignition</a> for instance, or Pete at <a href="http://www.secondave.com/SecondAvePartners.html">Second Ave</a>, and many others I am forgetting.</p>
