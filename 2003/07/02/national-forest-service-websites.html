<p>Your tax dollars at work over and over and over again. We’ve been scanning all the national forest websites, looking for trail and camping info. For instance – <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/" title="Olympic National Forest - Olympic Peninsula Washington">Olympic National Forest - Olympic Peninsula Washington</a>, and the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/oka/">Okanagon National Forest</a>, and the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/">Gifford Pinchot</a>, and the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/mbs/">Mt Baker-Snoqualmie.</a></p>

<p>Now as a taxpayer, I love all this info online, it is a great resource. But do we really need to have completely different website designs and architectures for every single national forest? This is just a sample of the forests near us, how much redundant effort is happening nationwide?</p>
