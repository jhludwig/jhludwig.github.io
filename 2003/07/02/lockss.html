<p>Saw a reference to <a href="http://lockss.stanford.edu/" title="Lockss Web Site">Lockss</a> in the recent <a href="http://www.economist.com">Economist</a> tech review. Its basic mission:</p>

<p><em>“let us save what remains: not by vaults and locks which fence them from the public eye and use in consigning them to the waste of time, but by such a multiplication of copies, as shall place them beyond the reach of accident.” – Thomas Jefferson</em></p>

<p>All well and good for libraries, but I need this for all my personal stuff too. I wish I had a dead simple way for instance of replicating all my digital photos to 3-4 different places, so that I was never at risk of losing them.</p>
