<p>Another random idea for the day. I kind of wish my PC kept up a blog of its own. I’d like to see day by day – what software was installed, what errors occurred, what config changes were made. all nicely categorized, which a nice search interface. A web interface so i could see it from anywhere of course and permit others as necessary to see it. A nice xml interface of course, it would be fun to do cross machine analysis. Kind of a replacement for existing error logs and audit logs – call it an “error blog” or “audit blog” (ok i am trademarking those terms right now!).</p>
