<p>Seen at <a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/weblog.php?id=P542" title="PhotographyBLOG -:- Home">PhotographyBLOG -:- Home</a> – the new Casio QV-R40 will have a shutter lag of just .01 seconds. I’m not a camera wonk but I hate the latency of my digital cameras today, so this sounds great to me.</p>
