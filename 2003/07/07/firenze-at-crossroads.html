<p>We’ve come to love <a href="http://www.crossroadsbellevue.com/restaurants_shops/firenze.htm" title="Untitled Document">Firenze</a> at Crossroads – it is one of the best Italian restaurants in the Seattle area. Not the most glamorous location but the food has always been killer and the staff is wonderful. We’ve eaten at a lot of west side italian places and we still come back to Firenze every couple of weeks.</p>
