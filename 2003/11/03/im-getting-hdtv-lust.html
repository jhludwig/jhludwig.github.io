<p>Between <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_home_theater/001170.html">Rich’s posts</a> and the incessant promos for Comcast HD during morning drive time on <a href="http://www.kjram.com/main.html">KJR</a>, I am starting to lust for HDTV. Some questions I have – when will DirecTV HD availability catch up to Comcast? When can I get <a href="http://www.tivo.com/5.3.1.1.asp?article=164">HDTV Tivo</a>? Are there such things as HDTV-encoded DVDs (I am aware this is a somewhat mangled expression of the idea) and where do I get them and what players play them?</p>
