<p>Not sure I am really a believer in Social Software as a space, but <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2003/11/social_software.html" title="Ross Mayfield's Weblog: Social Software Reader">Ross has a great collection of links</a> if you want to get educated. I guess I just don’t think average people will ever go out and say “I need to get me some social software today”. People will use point solutions for staying in touch with family, friends, workgroups, potential dates, etc. But these solutions will be dominated by the application (“finding a potential match”, “workgroup collaboration”), not by social software.</p>
