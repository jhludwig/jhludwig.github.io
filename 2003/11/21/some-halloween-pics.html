<p>OK I am a pretty lame photographer, and so here are <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/Halloween2003/halloween2003.htm">some lame halloween pics</a> from my setup this year. Apologize for their lack of comprehensiveness, lack of compositional quality, lack of any kind of style whatsoever. And apologize that I created this page in Word2003 so it is full of all kinds of html cruft. Next year I’ll get the <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001154.html">Sony camera mentioned below</a> so I can get some night shots…</p>
