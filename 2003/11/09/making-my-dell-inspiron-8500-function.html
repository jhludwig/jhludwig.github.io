<p>I’ve been wretling with a Dell portable this month that has had intermittent network access problems. I finally hit on a solution kind of randomly and the Dell support forums suggest that maybe it is the fault of the Internet Connection Wizard – <a href="http://forums.us.dell.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=insp_network&amp;message.id=14403" title="Re: Inspiron 8500 -- disabling Network Bridge - Inspiron - Network - Dell Community Forum">Re: Inspiron 8500 – disabling Network Bridge - Inspiron - Network - Dell Community Forum</a> – hard to believe but something clearly did establish a bridge on this machine and it has made networking unreliable. Why would I ever want to bridge networks on my laptop – sure I supposed there is a geek reason to do it, but why would a “wizard” ever leave me in this config?</p>
