<p><a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//000100.html" title="Tong Family Blog: DVD Playback on your PC">Tong Family Blog: DVD Playback on your PC</a> – rich found winDVD and PowerDVD to be the winners some months ago, a quick survey of the web doesn’t indicate much has changed. I am having trouble with stutter on a Celeron 2ghz, intel Xtreme Graphics oem chipset, 1.25Gig of ram machine. When using PowerDVD, watching Sopranos season 1. I’m wondering if this is a problem with PowerDVD and if windvd is a better performance product, or if I need to upgrade to a faster processer or gpu.</p>
