<p>Just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385504209/qid=1068435751/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7738134-9854363?v=glance&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a>. It’s a fine airplane or beach read – but what is all the excitement about? The puzzles are lame, the action is easily beat by about 50 other authors in the action category, it is not impressively deep in terms of literary or historical references, the characters are not amazing. It’s a fine overall package but not worth all the fuss. Do people really think the theme (a deep dark conspiracy within the church) is that amazing? Seemed like an old story to me.</p>
