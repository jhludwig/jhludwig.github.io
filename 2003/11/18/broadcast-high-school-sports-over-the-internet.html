<p>I’m looking for ways to broadcast high school sporting events over the internet – <a href="http://www.ihigh.com/0,1773,1_11_0,00.html" title="iHigh.com -- The High School Internet Network">iHigh.com – The High School Internet Network</a> seems to have a hosted solution with reasonable academic pricing. We could also cobble together a solution from Shoutcast but we don’t have a server location, we’d have to go to a hosted Shoutcast service like <a href="http://www.vbdigital.com/?action=sch">VBDigital</a>. I haven’t seen a lot of examples of schools doing broadcasts except at the ihigh site, still looking for best practices and ideas.</p>
