This is a great book. The story of a life-long relationship between a man suffering from random time travel events and his wife, and the effects that this situation has on their relationship. Just a wonderful story – great characters, a beautiful relationship. While time travel is a part of the story, the book doesn’t go over old time-travel ground but rather focuses on the relationship and how it evolves and develops. A great holiday gift.</p>
