<p>Bought a PC yesterday at <a href="http://www.pcclub.com/" title="PC Club - Where Computer Professionals Go">PC Club - Where Computer Professionals Go</a>-- a mini-ITX form factor box. Right across the street from a CompUSA which I also shopped at. Wow the experience between the two was so different.</p>

<p>At PC Club, the store is a little cr@phole of a store in a strip mall. Spartan interior with gear just laying around everywhere. Handwritten signs everywhere. The staff ignored me until I cornered one. And then they knew exactly what I was talking about and had me out the door in 10 minutes with my purchase.</p>

<p>The CompUSA was the standard glossy CompUSA. Tons of inventory. The staff descended on me. One guy claimed me as his and helped me find the monitor I needed. (I had been in earlier in the day and had asked for mini-ITX systems and gotten a blank look. In fact tho they had two different ones in stock). The guy pushed me hard to get an extended warranty, cutting prices on some minor items I bought, and in fact booking some of my purchase as an extended warranty on speakers â€“ he was trying to win some in-store contest. And checkout took FOREVER because he drug me over to the business center checkout, away from the regular retail checkout, again to win some stupid instore contest. A painful experience.</p>
