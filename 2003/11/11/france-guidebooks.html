<p>Been reading thru a bunch of guidebooks on France. The Lone<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/174059343X/qid=1068619905//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl14/002-5880129-3574433?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">ly Planet</a> series seems to resonate the most with me – good detail, very evocative, seems to talk about the things I want to hear about – a good mix of typical touristy stuff plus some outdoors activities. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/2060000297/qid=1068620053/sr=1-10/ref=sr_1_10/002-5880129-3574433?v=glance&amp;s=books">Michelin guides</a> are certainly detailed but I don’t know, everything starts to blur together, not evocative at all. They might be the guides to carry around tho.</p>
