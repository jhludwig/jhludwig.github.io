<p>Having fun over on <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com">fanblogs</a> arguing with a real dedicated Louisiana fan – <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/archives/000625.php">Latest BCS Rankings</a>. Amazing how much data the census department provides – the <a href="http://www.census.gov/govs/school/01fullreport.pdf">school spending data</a> is amazing – look at the spread across the country in figure 4 – an over 2x difference between the big spending states (NY) and the bottom (UT). Now some of this is just cost of living probably but a dramatic difference nevertheless.</p>

<p>And to the point – Ohio outspends Louisiana per student by a wide margin.</p>
