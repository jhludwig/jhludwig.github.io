<p><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/abcsports/BCSRankings" title="ABCSports.com - BCS Rankings Week 4">ABCSports.com - BCS Rankings Week 4</a> – OSU is #3, 1.5 points back of USC. Going to be tough to make up. USC has a weak schedule going forward – if SC doesn’t lose, OSU needs a) LSU to lose so that OSU can move up in the polls and get a point back, b) WSU to lose – maybe in the Apple Cup? – thus eliminating the quality win bonus for USC, and c) an improvement in its own strength of sched versus USC, some of which will happen. Going to be close. Assuming of course OSU wins out.</p>
