I predict it has the greatest impact of any single addition to my halloween haunt this year – I am going to place the output inside the scary tree i built. I’m combining it with some good Bose outdoor speakers so that I get really good fidelity with low noise out of the system. Really worth playing around with, a trial last night had our dogs cowering in the corner of the yard.</p>
