<p>Not going to be posting much here. heads down on halloween. struggling last night with interfacing pneumatic valves to my dmx control system. tried a <a href="http://www.gilderfluke.com/">gilderfluke</a> part to convert dmx input to analog output but it seems quite finicky about dmx input. Looking at maybe using a <a href="http://www.dovesystems.com/BuildPage.php?page=mtxde8&amp;d=" title="Dove Systems MTX-DE8 8 Channel DMX to Analog Decoder">Dove Systems MTX-DE8 8 Channel DMX to Analog Decoder</a> which is maybe where I should have started in the first place, since I have a lot of Dove dimmers and they have been rock solid for me. The good folks at <a href="http://www.pnta.com/index.html">PNTA</a> are helping me sort it all out â€“ great folks for gear here in town.</p>
