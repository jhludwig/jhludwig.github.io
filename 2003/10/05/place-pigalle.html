<p>Great dinner at <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/food/search_return.php?restaurant=1060&amp;formtype=food&amp;x=17&amp;y=16" title="SeattleWeekly.com - search">Place Pigalle</a> this weekend – we hadn’t been there in like 10 years and it is still a great restaurant in a great setting. Certainly one of my top recommendations for a night out in Seattle.</p>
