<p>Note for next year’s halloween – you can build a really simple coffin thumper by talking an old electric drill and attaching an armature to the end which will whack against your coffin wall. wire the trigger closed, attach to a dimmer, and place in a coffin or box. if i had a drill lying around today i’d try it.</p>
