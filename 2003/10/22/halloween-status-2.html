<p>I’m a bit delayed in testing all my setup since we had 5” of rain in one day on Monday. Yesterday was a lot clearer tho and I tested my <a href="http://www.fogmachines.com/">whole yard fog system</a> for the first time this season. Normal amount of leaks, got those all fixed, and it worked great! Filled my yard, the street, and the neighbor’s yard. Cars stopping, neighbor came over to chat, definitely this is always a highlight of our haunting. With blue filters put on all our yard lights, this fog alone creates a very eerie feeling.</p>
