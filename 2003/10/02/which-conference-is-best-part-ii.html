<p>In the comments on <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001065.html" title="a little ludwig goes a long way: Which conferences are the best in college football this year?">my post about college football conference strength</a>, Brian takes issue with a simple win/loss ranking, and he makes some good points. Rich Tellshow has done some <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rtell/teams/conf.html">further analysis on strength of schedules</a> which is worth looking at â€“ points to the Pac10 and Big10 as the strongest conferences so far this year.</p>
