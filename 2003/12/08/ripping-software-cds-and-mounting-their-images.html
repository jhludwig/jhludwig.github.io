<p>I tried a couple years ago to rip all my software cds and just mount their images as virtual CDs. It kind of worked tho it was frustrating. Here are some new pointers that make it worth looking at again – <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a37b2934-badd-4482-a949-552af45bc3b0" title="ComputerZen.com">ComputerZen.com</a> points to a driver from MSFT that mounts an ISO file as a virtual CD. Cdfreaks has a lot of great posts about Ripping of CDs – for instance <a href="http://club.cdfreaks.com/showthread.php?threadid=77918">here</a> and <a href="http://club.cdfreaks.com/showthread/t-77918-p-2.html">here</a>. I don’t care about making copies of CDs but I would love the convenience of not having to have all my game CDs on my desk.</p>
