<p>Good conversation about outsourcing to overseas developers at <a href="http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2003/12/09.html#a474" title="Due Diligence">Due Diligence</a>. The distinction between low-level coding work which can be outsourced, and more architecture/design-heavy work which perhaps canâ€™t be, is important. I am starting to believe that the boundary is moving in favor of outsourcing as communications and practices improve.</p>
