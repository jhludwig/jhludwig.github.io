<p>Built a shuttle this weekend with a <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/current/retailkits/wd360gdrtl.asp" title="WD Raptor 36 GB 10,000 RPM ESATA Hard Drive Kit - WD360GDRTL">WD Raptor 36 GB 10,000 RPM ESATA Hard Drive Kit - WD360GDRTL</a> as it’s boot drive – a nearly 40% improvement in speed over your standard 7200 rpm drive. Wow it makes a huge difference, I am very happy!</p>

<p>Training XP to use a SATA drive as a boot drive was a little tricky – involving:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing a SATA PCI card – I had a maxtor (promise-based) card that came free with another hard drive so I used that. Installed fine, tho XP has no drivers for it, but the drivers on the CD were certified</li>
  <li>Connecting up the WD drive. This was confusing. The drive end of the SATA cable was a 15 pin power-carrying connector, and the documentation warned many times about NOT connecting the standard 4-pin drive power connector if you were using a 15-pin connector. However, on the PCI card end, the SATA cable was data-only, and it was clearly not delivering power to the drive. I wasted time here until I finally just connected a spare 4-pin drive power connector and everything worked</li>
  <li>Getting confused by XP, which was looking for some Promise SATA driver, but finally just ignoring this error message after reading some forums which said it was harmless</li>
  <li>Running the included WD utilities to copy all my files from my old IDE boot drive over to the SATA drive, and setting the SATA drive to be a boot drive.</li>
  <li>But of course the utility didn’t really set the SATA drive up to be a boot drive, you have to muck around in the BIOS to do that, enabling SCSI boot as SATA masquerades as SCSI at this level of the system</li>
</ul>

<p>But it all works now and it is great!</p>
