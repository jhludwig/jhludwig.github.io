<p>Last night’s homework was on Pendulums – good site here – <a href="http://online.cctt.org/physicslab/content/Phy1HON/lessonnotes/pendulums/period.asp" title="Period of a Pendulum">Period of a Pendulum</a> – I had forgotten that, for simple pendulums, the period is basically independent of the mass – cool! Overall this is a high quality site for basic physics info.</p>
