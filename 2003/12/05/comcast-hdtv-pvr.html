      <td>PVRblog”) – I just got HD service turned on and man would I love this box. My cable settop box looks exactly like this one but is model number 6200 instead of 6208. It doesn’t seem to have any PVR functions which is a bummer. Do any other Seattle-area Comcast customers seem to have PVR functionality with their box?</td>
