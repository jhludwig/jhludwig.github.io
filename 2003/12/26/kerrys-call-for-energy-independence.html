<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/politics/campaigns/26ADBO.html?ex=1387774800&amp;en=d40fadd9ee12efff&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND" title="Kerry’s Call for Energy Independence">Kerry’s Call for Energy Independence</a> – i never blog on political issues but this one struck me as just odd. Why all the hoopla over oil? What about electronics independence, or timber, or food, or any other good we happen to import? And do we think more government involvement in the energy market will make it more efficient? And do the numbers even work out, could we realistically and economically ever be energy independent? I just think this is a weird platform plank to pin your hopes on. It may be a good thing to do but it has no emotional resonance with me.</p>
