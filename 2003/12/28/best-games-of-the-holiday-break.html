<p>We’ve played a lot of games over the holiday. Our grades:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.callofduty.com/index.asp" title="Activision: Call Of Duty">Call Of Duty</a>: A+. Multiplayer incredibly fun, servers easy to connect to, firewalls not a problem. The only real beef is the stupid bunny-hopping behaviour that some players adopt to avoid incoming fire.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Counterstrike</a>: A-. Great multiplayer gameplay. But aged graphics, ridiculously painful downloading required to get up and going, and confusing game lobby behaviour.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/">Halo for PC</a>. B+. Fun, not a bad way to spend time. But just doesn’t seem to have the same addictiveness of Call of Duty or Counterstrike.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.easportsbig.com/games/ssx3/home.jsp">SSX 3</a>. B+. OK we are suckers for snowboarding games. This is a reasonable next version of the SSX line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.xiii-thegame.com/uk/virtualtour/">XIII</a>. C+. A great idea and a good story line. But incredibly stupid save game behaviour makes the single player missions painful – needless repetition of solved missions is no substitute for real challenge. Oh and the end of level bosses are juvenile, making the game feel like a Mario title.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hidden-and-dangerous.com/hd2/index.aspx?bhcp=1">Hidden and Dangerous 2</a>. C-. A nice looking game, but so realistic that the fun is sapped out of it. Yes I am sure a single shot from that gun would really take me out of commission, but a fun game needs to be a little more forgiving.</p>
