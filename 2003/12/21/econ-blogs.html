<p>I am starting to find these discussions of applied microeconomics to be fascinating â€“ for instance <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2003/12/the_starbucks_v.html" title="ProfessorBainbridge.com: The Starbucks v. Subway Puzzle">ProfessorBainbridge.com: The Starbucks v. Subway Puzzle</a> and all the links it includes. I always enjoyed micro in grad school, and you can argue that my 4 years at Booz-Allen were an extended exercise in applied microeconomic analysis. Whatever, good stuff.</p>
