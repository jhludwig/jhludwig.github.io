<p>This time of year I really appreciate <a href="http://www.qfconline.com/" title="Quality Food Centers (QFC)">QFC’s</a> support of the needy – they make it incredibly easy to pick up a prepackaged $5 or $10 bag of groceries for the local foodbank. Every time I am in the store I grab one of these bags, it is a great and easy way to provide some help.</p>
