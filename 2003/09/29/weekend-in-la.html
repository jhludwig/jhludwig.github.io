<p>Spent the weekend in LA. A great place to visit but wow am I glad I live in the Northwest – the smog, lack of greenery, and congestion are so wearing.</p>

<p>Best things we did in LA: Dinner at <a href="http://losangeles.restaurantnotes.com/viewtopic.php?t=368" title="- MAKO in Beverly Hills is outstanding - The Best Los Angeles Restaurant Guides are your fellow diners!">Mako</a> – pan-asian cuisine served tapas-style. Great service and fun food. Lodged at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/losangeles/">Four Seasons</a> – great service, and a veritable freak show of celebrities, celebrity-wanna-bes, celebrity entourages, and plastic surgery victims.</p>

<p>Worst things we did in LA: Rodeo Drive looks like a war zone, don’t bother going until they finish the street work (Christmas? next year?). <a href="http://www.farmersmarketla.com/">Farmer’s Market</a> – a lousy market with lousy restaurants. Come up to Pike Place Market in Seattle instead. <a href="http://www.miramax.com/duplex/">Duplex</a> -- not Ben Stiller’s best work. Funny at times but overall pretty weak.</p>
