Doctorow. My first Doctorow, recommended by my friend Tim. Great tale, no good deed goes unpunished, and boy is the central figure punished in this story. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/068816112X/qid=1064853564/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-8011004-2835238?v=glance&amp;s=books">Replay</a> by Ken Grimwood. Read again based on several recommendations. An introspective and very human look at a classic scifi theme – what would you do if you could live your life again? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312308604/qid=1064853749/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-8011004-2835238">Year’s Best Science Fiction: Twentieth Annual Collection</a> is another good effort from Gardner Dozois. These collections are routinely good, and his annual review of sci fi publishing activity is always interesting and a source of potentially good reads.

I am just halfway thru, but this is a great story. Some of the blurbs compare it to Poe, the story itself references Kafka, a very compelling tale so far of a man in the grips of either a conspiracy or some dementia.</p>
