From Sunday’s LA Times coverage of the game: ?<em>When you get on a streak…you get to thinking it can never happen,</em>? Carroll said. ?<em>It can. You can get beat.?</em></p>

<p>Oregon fell prey to complacency as well this week. ?<em>We were still thinking about the Michigan game and I don’t think we were fired up</em>,? Oregon receiver Sammie Parker said. ?<em>Everyone is usually fired up in the locker room, but we were really quiet today. We were just kind of waltzing around and I don’t think we were ready to play</em>. ?</p>

<p>Now the Pac-10 is basically out of the national championship hunt. A lesson to all the other teams and conferences out there.</p>
