<p>I saw a quote from David Bowie this weekend in the NYTimes where he said (from my memory, forgive any misquote) “in the future, recorded music will not be a moneymaker, but be an advertisement for live performances by the artist”.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000383.html">Mitch Kapor</a> points to this quote by Adam Eisgrau – <em>“it’s time for the R.I.A.A.’s winged monkeys to fly back to the castle and leave the Munchkins alone”</em></p>
