<p>I need a cheap longdistance solution for calls within the US. The calling location is deep inside a building at <a href="http://www.pomona.edu">Pomona College</a> and cell coverage sucks.</p>

<p>Option A is prepaid cards. Genuine ATT cards are availabe on <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?query=at%26t+phone+cards&amp;ht=1&amp;sosortproperty=1&amp;from=R10&amp;BasicSearch=">ebay</a> for about 3.4 cents per minute. Or you can go even cheaper if you go to a site like <a href="http://www.callingcardplus.com">CallingCardPlus</a> -- rates down to .5 cents per minute. I am sure quality on some of these cheap plans is iffy.</p>

<p>The location does have 10mbit ethernet and so VOIP is an option – I wonder what will happen when every student starts using VOIP, I bet the campus net is not engineered for that case. <a href="http://www.pulver.com/fwd/" title="Free World Dialup - by pulver.com">Free World Dialup - by pulver.com</a> is a way to start, seems pretty geeky tho, you have to be a NAT expert – OK for me but not sure this will work for the caller. I wonder if <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> is any easier to use. I definitely want an option that uses a SIP phone or a regular phone, I don’t want to use a PC mic and headphones.</p>
