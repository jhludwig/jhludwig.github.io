<p>This seems inevitable to me – <a href="http://people.uis.edu/rschr1/archive/2003_09_07_archive.html#106301832858501506" title="Techno-News Blog">Techno-News Blog</a> – we need a stronger system of identity on the net if we really want to stop spam. I would switch to a mailsystem today that had a stronger notion and in fact I am evaluating all kinds of solutions currently.</p>

<p>Update: Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha. So I decided to start acting on my words and I thought I’d get a certificate so I could start signing all my email sent from Outlook. I clicked on the link in Outlook to get a certificate and I was take to <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/marketplace/PortalProviderPreview.aspx?AssetID=EY010504891033&amp;CTT=6&amp;Origin=EC010272491033&amp;&amp;helplcid=1033">this page</a> – my guess is that NO ONE tries to get certificates for Outlook based on this.</p>
