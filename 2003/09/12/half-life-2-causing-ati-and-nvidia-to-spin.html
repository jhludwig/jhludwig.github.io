Gabe at Valve currently seems to recommend the ATI 9800, tho Nvidia is spinning hard. It is fascinating that the release of a single game can cause so much angst, and as a user it is great to see these vendors trying to kill each other because I am going to get much faster video cards as a result.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Valve has released the new <a href="http://www.steampowered.com">Steam client</a> and the website is DOA, i assume it is getting hammered with traffic, so that is good for Valve.</p>
