<p>It’s surprising to us how little <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;edition=us&amp;q=disneyland">ongoing coverage</a> there has been of the death at Disneyland last week. Maybe because we were just there, and just on the ride, we expected to see more coverage and concern. We’ve see no outrage from the family of the victim or from the other injured parties. Disney must be bending over backwards to help them all?</p>
