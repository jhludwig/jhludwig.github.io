<p><a href="http://www.go-bucks.com/" title="The-Ozone">The-Ozone</a> seems to have the most likely analysis of this: <em>For the last several weeks there have been news reports citing unnamed sources regarding all sorts of details regarding the suspension. It is pretty safe to say that those “leaks” were not within the NCAA, and probably also safe to say that they are not within OSU. That leaves just one source, the Clarett family and the Clarett entourage. It is inconceivable that those leaks have endeared Clarett to either the NCAA or OSU.</em></p>
