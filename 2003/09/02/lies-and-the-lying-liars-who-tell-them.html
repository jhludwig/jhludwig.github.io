<p>Just finished Al Franken’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0525947647/qid=1062561274/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-7821633-9819810?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right">Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right</a>. I am on average a centrist with a slight tip to the right on economic issues, but I love this book. The far right creeps me out and I love to see Al whack them. This book is basically a hatchet job on the far right press, Fox Network and its ilk. Very funny. There is no real issue examination in the book, Al can be just as self-righteous as the far right, but he does a great job exposing their worst behaviours. Fox was stupid to sue Al, they just gave the book press and a huge sales impetus (It’s number one on Amazon right now), so even more people are going to see Fox reporters and newscasters exposed. Al is not the guy to do this – I’d love to see someone do a serious investigation of why Fox News and its ilk are so popular and successful right now. I just don’t watch it but obviously a lot of people do.</p>
