<p><strong>Crossroads blog event</strong>. I sadly had to miss this – <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00000825.html">Weblog Entry - 01/28/2003: “Sam Ruby Weblog Gather Report”</a> – I was up at the school watching a basketball game instead. Looks like a great list of people, wish I could have been there.</p>
