<p><strong>Buckeyes’ Physical Play</strong>. This was OSU’s key to victory in my mind – counter Miami’s speed with greater physicality. The Miami fans around us said they hadn’t seen hitting intensity like this before. It is the same level that we saw in the Michigan game. A speed advantage just doesn’t matter that much if you are getting hit constantly behind the line of scrimmage. <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/college/hurricanes/sfl-umfoot06jan06,0,7353010.story?coll=tf%2Dhurricanes">OrlandoSentinel.com: Hurricanes</a></p>
