<p><strong>Blogs and Education</strong>. I am headed up this week to <a href="http://www.forestridge.org">Forest Ridge School</a> to present blog technology to some of the teaching staff and talk about how to use the technology at the schools. Very excited to kick this effort off. I’d like to see the school embrace blogging in at least 3 ways. One, to replace their current extranet site – a great blog implementation would provide a more current and interesting site, allowing posts from the whole school community. Two, as an intranet tool for classroom discussions and other communities in the school. Three, I really want to get some students to embrace blogs. Seems like we need better blog/IM integration than is available today if we want young people to embrace – based on my observation of how much time students spend on IM. We need to think really hard about what parts of the IM experience should be persisted over to a blog, and how this should easily work.</p>
