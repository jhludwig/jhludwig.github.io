<p><strong>GPS solutions for PocketPC</strong>. Thinking about picking one of these up – <a href="http://www.mobileplanet.com/listing.asp?cat%5Fid=101&amp;cat%5Fname=Pocket+PC+Devices&amp;pdept%5Fid=23&amp;dept%5Fid=2310&amp;dept%5Fname=GPS+Solutions+">MobilePlanet</a> lists a lot of them. Not sure which one to pick – <a href="http://www.teletype.com/pages/gps.html">Teletype</a> has euro maps which I definitely want. It is not clear if <a href="http://www.pharosgps.com/products/toshiba/PF022.htm">Pharos</a> has euro maps. <a href="http://www.pocketgps.co.uk">PocketGPS</a> seems to be a good review and news site. Pretec and socket and travroute just seem to sell cards with other’s software.</p>
