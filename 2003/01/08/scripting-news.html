<p><strong>Dave wants us to build directories</strong>. I like the core idea here, my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html">Halloween blog</a> is basically a directory of useful Halloween links – <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/01/08#When:8:36:03AM">Scripting News</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>If I had a billion dollars I’d pay each of you $10,000 to read this page carefully, think about it, and then get started building a directory for each of three subjects you’re passionate about and knowledgable of</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been unhappy with standard blog tools as the way to build my halloween page, because a date organization is just not interesting. Maybe i should be building it as fundamentally an XML site and worry about html-ization of it later.</p>
