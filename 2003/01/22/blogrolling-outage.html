<p><strong>Blogrolling outage</strong>. Ouch, a brief <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com">blogrolling</a> outage and my site rendering and responsiveness turned to crap. Itâ€™s the only blogrolling outage over many months and it was brief so I am not upset about, but I need to look at a smarter way to cache my blogroll on my server so that my site can weather outages.</p>
