<p><strong>The Fall of Berlin: 1945</strong>. Just finishing this book about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0670030414/qid=1043258708/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-3725665-3568011?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">fall of Berlin</a> in 1945. Great account. What I take away: War is hell; If you fight one, donâ€™t lose; If you lose, surrender to nations with a strong history of civil rights, not to totalitarians; If you lose and you have committed genocide and other war crimes, well it is going to go hard on you.</p>
