<p><strong>I no longer care where my files are stored</strong>. Dead on – <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000386.phtml">0xDECAFBAD: I second that sacrilege</a>. And please make it work across the LAN. In our house, no one knows whether the file is on my machine, my son’s, my daughters, my firewire-attached drive, or the file server – and no one cares to know. Just find the dang thing for me.</p>
