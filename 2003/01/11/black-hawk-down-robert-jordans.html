<p><strong>Black Hawk Down, Robert Jordan’s Latest</strong>. Just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0140288503/qid=1042289339/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-7929887-9967955?v=glance&amp;s=books">Black Hawk Down</a> – yeah I know I am late to the party, but what a great book. Makes you really hesitant to send our forces to war – let’s make sure we really need to and are committed to any engagement. Now reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312864590/qid=1042289457/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-7929887-9967955">Crossroads of Twilight</a>, book 10 (!!!) of the Wheel of Time series. Dude, pick up the pace, at this point we will be reading book 37 some day and we’ll have advanced the story only about 2 months.</p>
