<p>From the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993796" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a>: <em>Young male salmon raised in fish farms mate more aggressively than their counterparts in the wild.</em></p>

<p>We ate at a premier seafood restaurant in Seattle last night and it was hard to get non-farmed salmon. Out of about 9 salmon dishes, only one was line-caught. Sad. And the menu totally obscures this by calling the farm-raised salmon “Pacific Northwest Salmon” on all the dishes – you have to ask a lot of questions to find out that this is == farm raised Atlantic salmon from farms in BC.</p>
