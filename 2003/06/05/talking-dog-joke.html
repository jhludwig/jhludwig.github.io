<p>From my Dad – a great one!</p>

<p>In Tennessee, a guy sees a sign in front of a house: “Talking Dog for Sale.”</p>

<p>He rings the bell and the owner tells him the dog is in the backyard. The guy goes into the backyard and sees a black mutt just sitting there. “You talk?” he asks.</p>

<p>“Yep,” the mutt replies.</p>

<p>“So, what’s your story?”</p>

<p>The mutt looks up and says, “Well, I discovered this gift pretty young and I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA about my gift, and in no time they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies eight years running.”</p>

<p>“The jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn’t getting any younger and I wanted to settle down. So I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals. Had a wife, a mess of puppies, and now I’m just retired.”</p>

<p>The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.</p>

<p>The owner says, “Ten dollars.”</p>

<p>The guy says, “This dog is amazing. Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?”</p>

<p>The owner replies, “He’s such a liar. He didn’t do any of that shit.”</p>
