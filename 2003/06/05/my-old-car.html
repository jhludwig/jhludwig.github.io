<p>Hey make an offer on it now before it is gone – <a href="http://www.parkplaceltd.com/webinventory/details.asp?id=1774" title="Park Place Ltd., Sales Department">Park Place Ltd., Sales Department</a>. I love this car, rides like a dream, but ultimately, it just wasn’t me.</p>

<p>To wit: Last year at Halloween, I was at Home Depot picking up some 10’ lengths of PVC pipe, for my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000703.html">floating lantern</a> project. So there I am in the parking lot, running 10’ lengths of PVC pipe from the front passenger foot well out the left rear window. This made the Jag look really classy.</p>

<p>A guy walks by with his wife, observes my loading, notes the <a href="http://www.ohio-state.edu/index.php">Ohio State</a> alum sticker in my window, and says sotto voce to his wife: “<em>Isn’t that just like a guy from Ohio. He buys the nicest car he can buy, and then he loads it up with lumber.”</em></p>

<p>Made my day!</p>
