<p>Hey <a href="http://blog.neoteny.com/nakajima/archives/005511.html" title="Satoshi's Wireless Weblog: User Interface is an Art: Harmony Remote">Satoshi</a> have you tried the Harmony web interface? It is actually amazingly good, it wasn’t hard to use or understand at all.</p>

<p>Now I agree that we can do so much better…all my devices should broadcast their ids using some RF scheme, so that my remote can learn about them dynamically and reconfigure itself on the fly. But the harmony is pretty good, my family is way happier with it than with any previous universal remote.</p>
