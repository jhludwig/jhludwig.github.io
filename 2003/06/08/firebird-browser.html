<p>After reading all the great comments on <a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000224.html" title="Mitch Kapor's Weblog: Switching to Mozilla">Mitch Kaporâ€™s Weblog re Switching to Mozilla</a>, I decided to try Firebird. It installed nicely and seems really zippy.</p>

<p>One big problem area tho is that I get a really poor experience with Exchange2k Outlook Web Access pages; it could be the server deciding that I am an unsupported client and sending me highly defeatured pages. OWA pages with IE make heavy use of DHTML and so I suspect the exchange server is picky about what clients it supports fully.</p>
