<p>I am a huge fan of reading RSS inside outlook or my mail client of the day, totally agree with <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=602" title="Greg Reinacker's Weblog - RSS Ubiquity">Greg</a> on this. Now I just need some more features. How about preview of postings from those sites that only publish headlines in their feeds – i’d love to get the first 3-4 lines of their article right in outlook so I could decide whether or not to go to the site.</p>
