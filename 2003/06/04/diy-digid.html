<p>The goals of this digital ID DIY project at <a href="http://www.blaserco.com/blogs/2003/06/04.html#a143" title="Escapable Logic">Escapable Logic</a> seem great. I remember talking with <a href="http://http://www.slivka.com/">Ben Slivka</a> when he tried to add Passport support to his site and gave up. An easy to implement simple digital ID effort that works for me and my close circle of friends would be great, I have to look into this more.</p>
