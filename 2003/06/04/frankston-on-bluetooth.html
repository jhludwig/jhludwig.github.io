<p>I generally agree with <a href="http://www.satn.org/#200381233" title="SATN.org: Comments from Bob Frankston, David Reed, Dan Bricklin, and others">Bob Frankston</a> that Bluetooth is troubled. But I did manage to make my first use of Bluetooth yesterday – I sent a picture from my <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/phones/3650">Nokia 3650</a> to his t68i and it worked amazingly. And then he sent a business card back and it worked.</p>

<p>The #1 way I’d use this would be to transfer entire phonebooks between phones if this was possible. Right now the phones just let you send single contacts at a time, this sucks.</p>
