<p>Everyone seems upset that we’ve found no WMDs – for instance – <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/06/04#a461" title="Philip Greenspun's Weblog:">Philip Greenspun</a> points to some UK news.</p>

<p>Seems to me our government set too tight a definition for WMDs. Didn’t September 11 demonstrate that the worst WMDs by far are people and organizations of people? With trivial technology, just people can cause all kinds of harm.</p>

<p>If I was in charge of the case for the war, I would have included people and organizations within the definitions of WMDs; particularly people and organizations that foment and export hatred of our culture/society (or really any culture/society, as it is the hatred and the actions that hatred bring on that we want to target).</p>

<p>But then, no one asked me.</p>
