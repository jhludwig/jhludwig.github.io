<p>So what does <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/134980728_webneuheisel12.html">Neuheiselâ€™s firing</a> mean for the Buckeyes? While short term it seems the UW program is in turmoil, the scuttlebutt out here is that Gilbertson is a more than adequate replacement. I suspect that the Huskies will be just as well prepared, and maybe even more driven to show the world that they are a great program, come the opener in Columbus.</p>
