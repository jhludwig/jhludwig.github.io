<p>At ignition this week, what is even worse than spam, is the flood of NDRs we are getting. Because some spammer has chosen to use a forged return address of bogusname@ignitioncorp.com, and is sending tons of spam to randomly created email addresses. we are thus getting a flood of NDRs.</p>

<p>it is ridiculous that the mail protocols that we use for our line of business permit this sort of chicanery.</p>
