<p>Finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767900561/qid=1057003382/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-1448938-0711023?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: Gulag: A History">Gulag: A History</a> last week. A little long but a great read. Made me think about all the material witnesses we are holding in this country and the prisoners at Guantanamo. We really need to hold ourselves to a higher standard, we need to either openly and fairly prosecute these people, or let them go.</p>
