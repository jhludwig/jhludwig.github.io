<p>This movie is in trouble. While watching <a href="http://www.hulkmovie.com/" title="The Hulk - Smashing Into Theatres June 20, 2003">The Hulk</a>, two 20-something guys in the theater fell asleep and were snoring. When your core market for comic-based movies can’t stay awake thru the film…</p>

<p>Contrast with <a href="http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/benditlikebeckham/">Bend It Like Beckham</a> which was just great.</p>
