<p>Just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375411933/qid=1057003748/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-1448938-0711023" title="Amazon.com: Books: A Shortcut Through Time: The Path to a Quantum Computer">A Shortcut Through Time: The Path to a Quantum Computer</a>. I’d say just an average science book. It didn’t really help me understand quantum computing components or algorithms that much. And also spent too much time on explaining classical computer terminology (explaining a NAND gate and its role as a universal constructor, explaining a Turing machine, explaining NP complete, explaining public key crypto, etc). In the author’s defense I’d guess this is a very hard book to write, I don’t think it is easy to explain quantum effects to those not deeply versed in the subject.</p>
