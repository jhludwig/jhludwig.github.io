I remember when Brad and I hired the Mac IE team – so many hurdles to overcome – hiring up a new team, based in the valley, to do Mac software. Seemed like I spent half my life justifying their existence and protecting them from the Redmond antibodies. Don and gang, you were great to work with. Wish you all the best.</p>
