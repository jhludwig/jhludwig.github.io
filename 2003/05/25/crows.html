<p>We love watching the <a href="http://www.crows.net/" title="Introduction to crows.net">crows</a> around our house. They are fascinating birds. They constantly harass the eagles and osprey that fly by â€“ why do the eagles and osprey put up with it? And they love stormy weather, all the crows come out and play in the wind. Crazy birds.</p>
