<p>We donâ€™t care for most of the items sold at<a href="http://www.gore-galore.com/" title="Gore Galore manufactures haunted house props, haunted house supplies, halloween props, halloween masks, costumes, corpses, special effects, body forms, halloween supplies">Gore Galore</a> because we try to run a PG-rated Halloween event, and we are just not into monsters and gore. But the <a href="http://goregalore.hypermart.net/images/Da_Boom_Air_Cannon.jpg">air cannon</a> they are going to offer is right up our alley, this would be a super cool addition to say our pirate scene.</p>
