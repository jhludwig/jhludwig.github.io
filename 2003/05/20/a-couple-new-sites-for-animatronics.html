<p><a href="http://www.effecteng.com/" title="untitled">Effective Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.bpesolutions.com/product.html">Blue Point Engineering</a> seem interesting, I need good vendors/sites that help me figure out exactly what pneumatics to buy for animatronic applications. <a href="http://www.hauntcontroller.com/">Frightmare</a> has an interesting product too.</p>
