<p>Looking for good reviews of aftermarket car stereo systems. <a href="http://www.carreview.com/Car,Audio/PSC_3644crx.aspx" title="Car Audio &amp; Electronics Reviews">Car Audio &amp; Electronics Reviews</a> has a lot of ratings (but make sure you have a popup stopper installed, it seems to try to pop a lot). <a href="http://www.caraudioheaven.com/">Car Audio Heaven</a> has links to lots of other sites. <a href="http://www.carstereo.com/">Car Stereo</a> is kind of a portal with a lot of classifieds. None of the sites seem to have a great database of reviews.</p>
