<p>An interesting way to transport home movies maybe â€“ <a href="http://www.deltrontech.com/Enclosure/CinemaDisk/cinemadisk.htm" title="USB 2.0 Portable Disk with Multimedia Playback Feature">USB 2.0 Portable Disk with Multimedia Playback Feature</a>. A lot pricier than a firewire or usb2.0 disk, but has the player/decoders built in so you can watch the output on a tv instead of depending on a pc being available. 20G seems a little small tho.</p>
