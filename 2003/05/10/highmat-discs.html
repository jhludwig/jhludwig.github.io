<p>HighMAT and Microsoft have just announced HighMAT CD Writing and Viewing software for Windows XP – <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/digitalmedia/20030507.html" title="20030507 Lockergnome Digital Media">20030507 Lockergnome Digital Media</a>. I agree with the Lockergnome analsys – I’ve read the HighMat site three times now and I still can’t figure out why I would want to be creating HighMAT media.</p>
