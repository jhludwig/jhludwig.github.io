<p>Sorry for long absence. The ISP that served our office went toes up. The same ISP that served my house. The transition to a new T1 took weeks longer than quoted. And to top it off, my account on our exchange server is corrupted, and my calendar is currently nonoperable. Gosh it has been fun.</p>
