<p>I’m looking for some good guided hike trips in the north cascades. <a href="http://www.courtneycountry.com/hike.html">Cascade Corrals</a> seems to offer some good trips – and you don’t have to carry a pack. <a href="http://www.sunmountainlodge.com/summer.html">Sun Mountain Lodge</a> has some packages with a little cushier accomodations. <a href="http://www.canadian-expeditions.com/welcomeframe.html">Canadian Expeditions</a> has some more rigourous trips up in BC. I think I’d prefer the Cascade Corrals level of exertion and rusticism.</p>
