<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2003_05_01_archive.html#200291511" title="Boing Boing: A Directory of Wonderful Things">Cory Doctorow</a> points to public comments on FCC discussions about some spectrum realloc. I like his description of the Cingular and ATT positions – <em>I think that the contrast between Cingular and AT&amp;T is especially striking here. AT&amp;T is saying, yeah, we’re a telco, this is gonna gore our ox, so we’ve gone out and bought a different ox. Cingular is saying, dammit, that’s our ox, where do you get off goring it?</em></p>
