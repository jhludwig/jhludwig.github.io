<p>At <a href="http://www.weblogg-ed.com/2003/05/13" title="Weblogg-ed Vol.2: Using Weblogs in Education">Weblogg-ed Vol.2: Using Weblogs in Education</a>, it’s noted from a Pew study that our kids are way ahead of the schools in using the internet – <em>They’re “far ahead of their teachers and principals in taking advantage of online educational resources” - such as weblogs - the report concludes</em>. Boy no kidding, you don’t have to sit around kids long to see how they take to the internet like ducks to water. Their use is more pervasive and deeper than the bulk of educators. I would love to get involved with designing course material that really pushes the kids on their internet use – most of the time, I think the kids are just coasting, they are so far ahead of the school’s expectations in terms of using the net resources.</p>
