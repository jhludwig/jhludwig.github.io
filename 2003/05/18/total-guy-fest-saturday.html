<p>First down to Orting to meet up with <a href="http://www.smithstuff.net/">Adrian</a> and watch some rockets fire. Some crappy weather, I couldn’t stay long enough to see Adrian’s rocket, but we saw lots of other cool rockets.</p>

<p>Lunch at <a href="http://www.burgerking.com/">Burger King</a>. They have new chicken tenders in the shapes of stars and lightning bolts. I don’t even want to think about what we were really eating.</p>

<p>Then Paintball at <a href="http://www.splatattackonline.com/field/" title="Splat Attack">Splat Attack</a> – a great place, nice people. A little hard to find – print out the directions and follow them religiously, and have your windows rolled down so you can hear the rat-a-tat-tat of the guns.</p>
