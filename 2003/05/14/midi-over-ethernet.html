<p>For future Halloween consideration – looks like you’ll be able to run MIDI over IP – <a href="http://www.dmidi.org/index.php" title="IEEE P1639 - Distributed MIDI">IEEE P1639 - Distributed MIDI</a> – I’d assume 802.11 would work too. Would be a nice control protocol option, there is lots of MIDI-compatible prop control gear and lighting. And I’d love to be able to use a nice MIDI keyboard as my central control station for Halloween props.</p>
