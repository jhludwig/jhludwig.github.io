<p>We’ve been getting into paintball a little. Just finding a field in the seattle area is tricky. There are a lot of really stale pointers to fields on the web. <a href="http://www.splatattackonline.com/field/" title="Splat Attack">Splat Attack</a> appears to be the place to play south of town. <a href="http://www.stpfield.com/">STP</a> is the place north of town. A “paintball portal” for the northwest is <a href="http://mortonwebdesign.com/PaintballNWmenu.htm">PaintballNW</a>.</p>
