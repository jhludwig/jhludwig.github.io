<p><strong>RSS aggregator inside my IM client.</strong> I’d really love a simple RSS aggregator inside my IM client. One that would a) automagically get the correct URL for my buddy’s RSS feeds from the IM service – perhaps a normalized form in their comments field or other fields; b) let me know when my buddies post a new post or picture, c) let me know when my buddies post a comment to my site or a trackback to my site. I don’t want the full set of RSS headlines in the IM client, just the ones that have been posted in say the last hour (or whatever I configure the trigger to be). I started thinking about this today as I was thinking about picture sharing with my family – I already have a list of my family members in my AIM and MSN IM clients, why can’t I just put some notifications up there from them?</p>

<p>The APIs for plugging into MSN IM are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/topic.asp?url=/msdn-files/028/001/359/topic.xml">here</a>. Looks like you have to write a COM component, yuck, not my forte. I can’t find the AIM APIs, I am still digging.</p>
