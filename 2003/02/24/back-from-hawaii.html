<p><strong>Back from Hawaii</strong>. I’m back – had a great 12 days at <a href="http://www.konavillage.com/">Kona Village Resort</a> – a long time favorite of ours. and then another 3 days next door at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/hualalai/">Four Seasons Hualalai</a> – our first time there, a beautiful place, tho not quite as relaxed and intimate as Kona Village. Great weather, lots of humpback whales, a fun trip up to the caldera, some good stargazing. No Blackberry coverage, no laptop, no internet terminals, no cellphone, no tv for most of the stay – it was great to disconnect, I am thinking about going internet/pc/tv free on every saturday from now on.</p>
