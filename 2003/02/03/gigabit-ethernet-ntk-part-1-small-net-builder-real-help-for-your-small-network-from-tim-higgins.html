<p><strong>Gigabit Ethernet NTK - Part 1 : Small Net Builder : Real Help for Your Small Network from Tim Higgins.</strong> <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/">Rich</a> turned me onto this, a good <a href="http://smallnetbuilder.com/Sections-article41-page5.php">primer on starter hardware for gbit ethernet</a>. I am going to move to gbenet sometime in the next two months – copying 25G vidcap files around the lan is no fun. I think tho that I will still have problems as i think my NAS box is based on samba code with a 2G filesize limit – that is what I get for buying a cheapo NAS.</p>
