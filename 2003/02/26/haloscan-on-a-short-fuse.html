<p><strong>Haloscan on a short fuse</strong>. <a href="http://www.haloscan.com">Haloscan</a>, the external commenting service I use, seems to be down more than up, and it kills page load performance when it is unavailable. I am giving them this week to fix it before I give up. May be what drives me to moveable type finally, Iâ€™ve been too lazy to move to it, but I hate it when my pages load slowly.</p>
