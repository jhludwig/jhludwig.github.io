<p><strong>Pneumatics for Halloween</strong>. A pointer to a good pneumatics primer on my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/radio/2003/02/26.html">Halloween at the Ludwig House</a> blog. I’m thinking that a pneumatics project will be my big effort this year. I’d like to learn about the gear and my feeble attempts at animation last year (small motor driven) basically sucked.</p>
