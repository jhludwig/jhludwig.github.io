<p><strong>Jim Allchin vs Google</strong>. I have to agree with <a href="http://www.boosman.com/blog/">Frank</a> – Jim’s comment struck me as a little over the top. I think Jim meant well but this comes across as incredibly insulting to Google and very egotistical. I am sure the Google guys feel all warm and fuzzy this morning about Microsoft and Longhorn.</p>
