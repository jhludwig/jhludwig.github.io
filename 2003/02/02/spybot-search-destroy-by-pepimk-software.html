<p><strong>Spybot S&amp;D</strong>. Iâ€™ve seen several good reviews of <a href="http://security.kolla.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=about">Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy by PepiMK Software</a>. I just tried it out, it found a lot of garbage on my machine, mostly installed by games. Worth trying.</p>
