<p><strong>Vibe Install</strong>. After reading <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/solution-20030226.html">Walt’s glowing review</a> of <a href="http://www.sharethevibe.com/">vibe</a> yesterday in the <a href="http://www.wsj.com">Journal</a>, I downloaded and tried today. The download and install were fine but I hit a brick wall – it requires a static IP address. Ouch, that seems like a pretty big mistake.</p>
