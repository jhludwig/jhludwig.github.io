<p><strong>The Sonics Could Be Worse</strong>. OK, the Sonics have a history of bad decisions at the center and power forward positions. And you have to lay the blame at Wally Walker’s feet. Still though, I guess it could be worse – <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0227/1515095.html">Vin Baker is imploding</a> and Shawn Kemp’s troubles are legend. We could have stood pat with one of those guys, the team would have been worse.</p>
