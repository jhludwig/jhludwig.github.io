<p>I agree with Phil and his friends – <a href="http://www.windley.com/2003/08/29.html#a796" title="Windley's Enterprise Computing Weblog">Windley’s Enterprise Computing Weblog</a> – the flood of truly egregious spam is moving people past caring about privacy issues and big brother issues. They want the spam problem solved and if they have to give up something they will. But at the same time users are drowning in IT complexity. the first company that creates an easy to use secure mail system will capture a lot of users, even if they sacrifice privacy or other features.</p>
