Boy there is a lot of truth in this. During my tenure at MSFT I watched competitor after competitor blow their own foot off – Lotus, Novell, Netscape, AOL more recently, IBM, etc. MSFT pushed these companies hard in the marketplace but more often than not, it seems like the competitor did themselves in.</p>
