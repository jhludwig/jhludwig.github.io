<p>We were at <a href="http://www.pomona.edu" title="Pomona College">Pomona College</a> last week and I have to say, the staff was great, everyone was super helpful. And the fact that the student body is the <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/rankings.asp?listing=1022748&amp;LTID=1">2nd happiest</a> student body in the country makes us feel good. Good luck L.</p>

<p>Update: some quick feedback on the Pomona IT and telecom resources. Not much WIFI on campus – a few access points but it is not pervasive in the dorms, that’s too bad. Of course they do have 10Mbit links to all the dorm rooms – I wonder when they will switch to 100mbit? On the telecom side, the school recommends T-Mobile but I am underwhelmed with the coverage. Word on the street is that Verizon may be the way to go.</p>
