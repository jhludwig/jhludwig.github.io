<p>A new offering – <a href="http://www.coolstuffcheap.com/icefogmachine.html" title="Antari Ice Low Lying Fog Machine - Fog Machines &amp; Fog Juice">Antari Ice Low Lying Fog Machine</a>. As most halloween geeks know, your typical fog machine emits slightly heated fog which tends to rise. Here’s a new unit that solves the cooling problem without having to build your own cooler, futz around with dry ice, etc. And I note it is DMX controllable. I don’t think I’ll get one of these this year, I already have 4 fog systems and they are all working ok, but maybe when one of these wears out…</p>
