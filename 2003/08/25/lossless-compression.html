<p>Like rich, I am interested in switching to lossless compression for my music files â€“ <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/001069.html" title="Tong Family Blog: Lossless Encoding">Tong Family Blog: Lossless Encoding</a>. I wonder tho how well these work with non-pc devices like my kenwood/phatnoise music keg?</p>
