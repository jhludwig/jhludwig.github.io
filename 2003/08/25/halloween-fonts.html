<p>A large selection of fonts for halloween – <a href="http://www.goblinville.com/fonts/bloody.htm" title="Bloody Fonts">Bloody Fonts</a>. Recommended use is to for templates for tombstone lettering, etc. Tho I found some really nice stencils at Michael’s last year that were supposed to look like logs and sticks but looked a lot like femurs and tibulas.</p>
