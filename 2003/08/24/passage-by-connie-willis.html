<p>As one of the Amazon reviewers says, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553580515/qid=1061766790/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-5693187-3796024?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: &lt;i&gt;Passage&lt;/i&gt;">Passage</a> is a “fascinating topic, so-so novel” which “seems bloated and frequently dull”. I liked the <em>Doomsday Book</em> by this author (who didn’t), but <em>Passage</em> was trying.</p>
