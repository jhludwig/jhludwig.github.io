<p><a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/2003/08/18" title="Hack the Planet:">Hack the Planet</a> points to a <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/18/HNdarpasun_1.html">good article on Infoworld</a> about Sun’s work to get a supercomputer on the desk. “…heat management is by far the toughest problem…” – i have this problem in spades now, we have 3 PCs around a table in my office at home, and two more in the closet + cablemodem + firewall + 2 printers + 3 firewire drives, and heat is a huge issue. Heat output will be a primary criteria in my next PC purchase.</p>
