<p>I’ve had it on my shelf for years, I finally read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451527984/qid=1062353346/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_3/103-7821633-9819810?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: The Inferno">The Inferno</a> by Dante Alighieri. After reading <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000955.html">Passage</a> and disliking it, I needed to read some higher quality literature on the theme of death and the afterlife. Surprisingly approachable for a 700-year old text, I assume that is in part due to the translation. Very interesting to understand the hierarchy of sins in the mind of someone living in 1300 AD – I don’t think most people would have the same levels of classification today.</p>
