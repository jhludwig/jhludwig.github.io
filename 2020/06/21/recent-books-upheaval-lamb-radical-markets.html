  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upheaval/dp/0141977787">Upheaval</a> by Jared Diamond. Not as breakthrough as his earlier work, but an engaging look at crises and how nations react to them. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Finland because I was so ignorant of Finnish history.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lamb-Gospel-According-Christs-Childhood/dp/0380813815">Lamb</a> by Christopher Moore. An irreverent modern gospel, fun to read and still very true to the story and meaning of Christ. Will not be everyone’s cup of tea but I loved it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eric-Posner-ebook/dp/B07TP5HLWQ">Radical Markets</a> by Eric Posner and E. Glen Weyl. It promises radical ideas to improve the functioning of our markets and society. The first chapter was a little slow. In the second chapter they introduce their ideas for voting, and then offhandedly state that they have patented all this and have software you can buy. And I realize “Damn, this is a whitepaper for their business, and I paid for it.” Didn’t finish.</li>
