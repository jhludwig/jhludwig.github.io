  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19191674-slow-horses">Slow Horses</a> by Mick Herron. Great tale of intrigue inside MI5. Started a little choppy but then the story took off and the characters rose to the fore.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18378002-intuition-pumps-and-other-tools-for-thinking">Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking</a> by Daniel Dennett. I really thought I would like this, but too much “angels on the head of a pin” for me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora">The Lies of Locke Lamora</a> by Scott Lynch. What an awesome tale of a gang of thieves ensnared in conspiracy on top of conspiracy. Really fun read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51323365-solutions-and-other-problems">Solutions and Other Problems</a> by Allie Brosh. At times funny, at times deeply sad, always very human. Some of the insights into dogs and pet owners are hilarious.</li>
