<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.hbo.com/euphoria">Euphoria</a> is an explosive series. High school like I never experienced, kids struggling with big issues, and I was rooting for them all and blown away by them all. I never expected to like a high school drama, but this is an intense and deep show.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy">Ted Lasso</a> is funny and touching. Jason Sudeikis plays a lovable, optimistic, vulnerable role that is very endearing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://taylor.lnk.to/folkloredlxWE">Folklore</a> by Taylor Swift. I am not generally a huge Taylor fan but this has been the soundtrack of our summer. I love the stripped down presentation.</li>
