  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31253737-an-american-sickness">An American Sickness</a> by Elisabeth Rosenthal. An anecdote-driven walk through the dysfunctional health care industry. Some enraging anecdotes, and some useful how-toâ€™s at the end. Would have liked even more data but overall a very useful read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36602943-the-origin-of-wealth">The Origin of Wealth</a> by Eric D. Beinhocker. An excellent book, re-establishing the basis of economics and wealth from first principles, overturning a lot of the traditional economics I learned once upon a time. Very satisfying to see economics built up as emergent behaviors from the actions of individuals, and to see the incorporation of uncertainty, imperfect information, and iteration. Not a complete story but excellent.</li>
