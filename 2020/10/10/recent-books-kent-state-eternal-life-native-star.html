  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50159458-kent-state">Kent State</a> by Derf Backderf. The Kent State shootings stand tall in my memory, but I don’t think I ever knew all the details of the events. This is an excellent telling of the story. Calling out the National Guard is almost never a good idea.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35667296-eternal-life">Eternal Life</a> by Dara Horn. Explores that the idea that a very long life renders meaningless most life events.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7236997-the-native-star">The Native Star</a> by M. K. Hobson. Fun adventure thru an 1800s America where magic is a normal thing. Perhaps not very differentiated ground but a fun tale nevertheless. Makes me want to read more in the series.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6004724-the-snakehead">The Snakehead</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe. Inside the illegal immigration trade for a period of the 90s. A rough trade, amazing what people will go through for a chance to better their lives and their family’s lives.</li>
