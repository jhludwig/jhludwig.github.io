<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25597172-the-blizzard">The Blizzard</a> by Vladimir Sorokin. A book about a terrible storm written by a Russian author? I expected some serious gloom, but this story was trippy and strange. Memorable but weird.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46002342-me-and-white-supremacy">Me and White Supremacy</a> by Layla F. Saad. A challenging book, but I certainly need to be challenged on these issues. Very worth the time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50165554-one-billion-americans">One Billion Americans</a> by Matthew Yglesias. An interesting premise and some very good ideas. Needs a more thorough and detailed discussion and analysis but thought-provoking.</li>
</ul>
