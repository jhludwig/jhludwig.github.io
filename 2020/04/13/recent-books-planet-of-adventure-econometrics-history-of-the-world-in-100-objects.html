<p>Cleaning up the bookshelves while we are shut in…</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Planet-Adventure-Chasch-Servants-Dirdir/dp/0312854889">Planet of Adventure</a> by Jack Vance. If you like Burrough’s Mars books, then you will like this. I read the Burroughs books when I was very young, and they have not held up well, but I loved them as a kid. And I kind of love this tho again has not aged well.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201715953">Introduction to Econometrics</a> by James H. Stock, Mark W. Watson. On my shelves for 16 years, not sure why. An average intro to regression analysis.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-World-100-Objects-ebook/dp/B0052RCX0G/">A History of the World in 100 Objects</a> by Neil MacGregor. Much better than I anticipated, a very readable and visual walk thru the entire span of human history.</li>
</ul>
