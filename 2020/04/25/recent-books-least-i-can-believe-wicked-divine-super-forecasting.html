<p>Cleaning up the bookshelf during the pandemic – a little eclectic.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Least-Believe-Still-Christian-ebook/dp/B00AZ3W2IU">What’s the Least I Can Believe and Still Be a Christian</a> by Martin Thielen. I was raised Presbyterian but it didn’t really take. I still tho got a lot of value out of this book, particularly the first half which debunks some of the worst behaviours of some “Christians”. Recommended for believers and non-believers both.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Divine-Vol-Faust-Act-ebook/dp/B015X9BE8Y">The Wicked + The Divine</a> by Gillen, McKelvie, Wilson, Cowles. I try a graphic novel every so often and this got good reviews. Didn’t really catch my attention, jumped in midstream to the characters and I didn’t ever bond to any of them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock-ebook/dp/B00RKO6MS8">Super Forecasting</a> by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner. Great book about forecasting and leadership. The basic rules resonate across so many fields – be tangible; measure performance; iterate. Really nice work.</li>
</ul>
