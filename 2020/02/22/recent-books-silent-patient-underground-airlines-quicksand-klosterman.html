  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Patient-Alex-Michaelides-ebook/dp/B07D2C6J4K">The Silent Patient</a> by Alex Michaelides.  A woman murders her husband and is found insane, and a therapist digs in to get the truth.  Very twisty and fun.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Underground-Airlines-Ben-H-Winters-ebook/dp/B017RQP41O">Underground Airlines</a> by Ben H. Winters.  A suspense story set in a world where the Civil War never happened and slavery continues to this day.  Tough topic, disturbing at times, good tale.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quicksand-Novel-Malin-Persson-Giolito-ebook/dp/B01GYPLREM">Quicksand</a> by Malin Perrson Giolito. Well reviewed but I couldn’t make it through, might be due to a weak translation.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-What-If-Were-Wrong/dp/0399184139">But What If We’re Wrong</a> by Chuck Klosterman.  Very thoughtful discussion of our conventional wisdom about culture, science, and other topics.  We are certainly wrong about many things we believe – how are we probably wrong, where is truth likely to be found, and does it matter?</li>
