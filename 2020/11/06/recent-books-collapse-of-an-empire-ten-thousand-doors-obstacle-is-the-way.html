  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1086772.Collapse_of_an_Empire">Collapse of an Empire</a> by Yegor Gaidar. Good look at the unraveling of the USSR, it’s inherent fragility, and the human costs of the unraveling. Recommended by my Russian friends.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43521657-the-ten-thousand-doors-of-january">The Ten Thousand Doors of January</a> by Alex Harrow. Love stories wrapped up in a tale of many worlds. More touching than expected.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18668059-the-obstacle-is-the-way">The Obstacle Is the Way</a> by Ryan Holiday. Might have been more meaningful earlier in life. At my advanced age, you’ve probably learned most of these lessons.</li>
