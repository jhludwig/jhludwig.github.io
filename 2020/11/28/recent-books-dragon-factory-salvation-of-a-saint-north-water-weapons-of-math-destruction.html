  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6962671-the-dragon-factory">The Dragon Factory</a> by Jonathan Maberry. Would have been a good graphic novel – evil albino twins, gene-engineered monsters (scorpion-dogs!), Nazis, a plot to end the world. Just a so-so book.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13506866-salvation-of-a-saint">Salvation of a Saint</a> by Keigo Higashino. Agatha Christie style story, fun, I would happily read more of these.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25666046">The North Water</a> by Ian McGuire. Baffin Island always sounded cool as a kid. This book puts the kibosh on that, it is a murderous place. Good tale.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015">Weapons of Math Destruction</a> by Cathy O’Neil. When the author sticks to anecdotes and data, and allows the reader to form their own opinions, this book works. But the author spends too much time telling the reader how to think, versus leading the reader.</li>
