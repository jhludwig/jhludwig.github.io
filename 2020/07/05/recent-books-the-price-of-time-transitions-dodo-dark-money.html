  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Tigner-ebook/dp/B07NXXYG1G">The Price of Time</a> by TIm Tigner. What a crappy suspense story. Poor characters, poor plot, just bad. I don’t know why I stuck with it, I am embarrassed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Transitions-Making-Sense-Lifes-Changes/dp/0738285404">Transitions</a> by William Bridges. Much to think about in this book. I have certainly not been thoughtful about the transitions in my life and it is near time to start thinking about the remaining transitions ahead of me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-D-D-Novel-ebook/dp/B01M0HPHR6">The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O</a> by Neil Stephenson and Nicole Galland. Fun time travel historical novel. A trifle long.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical/dp/0307947904">Dark Money</a> by Jane Mayer. Good book but it will be hard to finish. I knew that the Koch’s and their ilk were amoral self-interested traitorous manipulative bas%#@ds but this really brings it home, it is hard to read. It is A-OK to have different views on issues in our society, but the way they have used their money to corrupt the system is sickening.</li>
