I am currently unemployed for the first time in my adult life.  I should have done this a long time ago!  Prior to this, I have worked at:

- [Lear](https://www.lear.com)
- [Xevo](https://www.xevo.com) (acquired by Lear)
- Surround.io (acquired by Xevo)
- [Ignition Partners](https://www.ignition.vc)
- [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com)
- [Booz-Allen & Hamilton](https://www.strategyand.pwc.com) (since acquired by PWC)

I have degrees from:

- [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) -- MS in Mechanical Engineering
- [Carnegie-Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) -- MS in Electrical Engineering, MS in Industrial Administration (MBA)
- [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu) -- BS in Electrical Engineering

I’m usually in the Northwest, tho occasionally in California.

My current interests include learning, books, computing, IoT, strategy, society, and college football.  In the past I spent way too much time on Halloween decorating.  I have burgeoning interests in pickleball and rock hounding.
