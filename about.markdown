I am currently unemployed for the first time in my adult life.  I should have done this a long time ago!  Prior to this, I have worked at:

- [Lear](https://www.lear.com).  I led the Xevo automotive SAAS platform for our automaker customers, and contributed to Lear's work on creating an overall software strategy
- [Xevo](https://www.xevo.com) (acquired by Lear).  I was president of Xevo, managing all development and delivery of Xevo's various automotive software platforms and apps.
- Surround.io (acquired by Xevo).  We were working on edge computing for a variety of use cases, including automotive.
- [Ignition Partners](https://www.ignition.vc).  I was a founder and GP of Ignition Partners, along with a set of other Microsoft escapees and wireless industry escapees.
- [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com).  I started as an individual contributor in the network business, and ultimately was a Vice President in charge of various system software and cloud solutions.  I am most proud of our work on Windows 95 and on Internet Explorer versions 1, 2, 3.
- [Booz-Allen & Hamilton](https://www.strategyand.pwc.com) (since acquired by PWC).  I was a general strategy consultant, working for a lot of Midwestern corporations.

I have degrees from:

- [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) -- MS in Mechanical Engineering
- [Carnegie-Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) -- MS in Electrical Engineering, MS in Industrial Administration (MBA)
- [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu) -- BS in Electrical Engineering

I’m usually in the Northwest, tho occasionally in California.

My current interests include learning, personal IP management, reading, IoT, strategy, society, and college football.  In the past I spent way too much time on Halloween decorating.  I have burgeoning interests in pickleball and rock hounding.
