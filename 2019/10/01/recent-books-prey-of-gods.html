  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prey-Gods-Nicky-Drayden-ebook/dp/B01LY7NUYQ/">The Prey of Gods</a> by Nicky Drayden. Started out great with some novel characters and South African setting, kind of sputtered out.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Long-Ships-Review-Books-Classics-ebook/dp/B003WUYOP2">The Long Ships</a> by Frans G. Bengtsson.  OK how did I miss this for so long??  What a delightful escapade set during Viking times.  I am stunned I never found this when I was younger.  Thoroughly entertaining.</li>
