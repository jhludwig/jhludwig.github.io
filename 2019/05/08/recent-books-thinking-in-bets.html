  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions/dp/0735216371" title="Amazon">Thinking in Bets</a> by Annie Duke. Really great book about decision making, and how to think probabilistically about decisions. Very good.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Agent-Daniel-Suarez-ebook/dp/B01J2SU2YO/">Change Agent</a> by Daniel Suarez.  Suarez is always super fun, this is a great tale of genetic editing and the criminal behaviours it may lead to.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf">The Mueller Report</a>.  A bit of a slog but something everyone should read.

      <li>I came away angrier at FB/TWIT for failing to aggressively address their roles in election interference</li>
      <li>I am angry at the Trump administration and all parts of the government for failing to aggressively defend our political system.  The identified Russian actions to manipulate our elections are certainly just the tip of the iceberg.</li>
      <li>And there seems little doubt about obstruction, and obstructive actions continue today.</li>
    </ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ship-Edge-Universe-Salvagers-Book-ebook/dp/B0763KVBBH">A Big Ship at the Edge of the Universe</a> by Alex White.  Fun space romp.</li>
