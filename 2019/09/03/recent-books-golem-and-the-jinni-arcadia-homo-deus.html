  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Golem-Jinni-Novel-P-S/dp/0062110845">The Golem and the Jinni</a> by Helene Wecker. In the late 1800s in NYC, a golem and a jinni struggle to fit into human society and become human themselves. Very entertaining and a nicely introspective about what defines humanity. Iâ€™d had this on the Kindle forever, Vlad goaded me into reading.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcadia-Iain-Pears/dp/1101970839">Arcadia</a> by Iain Pears. A fantasy, science fiction, time travel, mystery, adventure, book within a book. A lot going on in here and very engaging.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464345">Homo Deus</a> by Yuval Noah Harari. Some compelling ideas but boy a lot of words. And in the last third of the book he goes off the rails, he has a mechanistic view of science and biology that feels very off. Still a good read but could be better.</li>
