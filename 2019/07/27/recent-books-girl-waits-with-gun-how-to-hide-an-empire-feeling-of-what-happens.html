  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Waits-Kopp-Sisters-Novel-ebook/dp/B00QPHKR3M">Girl Waits With Gun</a> by Amy Stewart. Great story based of a budding female detective in the early 1900s. Based on a real person, this is a great retelling.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Hide-Empire-History-Greater-ebook/dp/B07D6MGV9Y">How to Hide an Empire</a> by Daniel Immerwahr. The history of the US’s various territories and possessions. Guess what, we have often treated the people in these territories poorly (and still do today). Kind of a goofy title for the book but interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-What-Happens-Emotion-Consciousness/dp/0156010755">The Feeling of What Happens</a> by Antonio Damasio. There have been times in my life when I would have eaten this up, but this isn’t one of those times. A very deep look at emotions and consciousness and the body, and I find it wearing.</li>
