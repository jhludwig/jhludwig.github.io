  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Old-Man-Thomas-Perry-ebook/dp/B01LFQ3LE4">The Old Man</a> by Thomas Perry. A lazy suspense novel, unimpressed. The action moves along ok but the characters are tissue thin. And when I see a character arrive in Vancouver on a train and “catch a cab to Victoria”, I just get pissed off, the author is just sloppy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Collapsing-Empire-Interdependency-Book-ebook/dp/B01F20E7CO">The Collapsing Empire</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Consuming-Fire-Interdependency-Book-ebook/dp/B078X255Y1">The Consuming Fire</a> by John Scalzi. Entertaining and fun, kind of an homage to Asimov’s Foundation series.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-Spoon-Madness-Periodic-Elements/dp/0316051632">The Disappearing Spoon</a> by Sam Kean. A delightful walk thru the periodic table and all of the human stories behind the elements.   Very engaging.</li>
