  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC">Walkaway</a> by Cory Doctorow.  My first Doctorow, and I am not sure I will do any more.  A hash of steampunk, cyberpunk, biohacking, post-gender, libertarian themes all jammed into a stew, and there just isn’t much story or character in there.</li>
  <li><a href="http://Less (Winner of the Pulitzer Prize): A Novel https://www.amazon.com/dp/031631613X">Less</a> by Andrew Sean Greer. Contrast with above, a great character finding himself in the middle part of his life.  Informed by the generations before and after him as they deal with their own crises.</li>
  <li><a href="http://Babel: Around the World in Twenty Languages https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802128793">Babel</a> by Gaston Dorren.  A look at each of the top 20 most used languages in the world.  And a lot of cultural insight along the way.  Very good.</li>
