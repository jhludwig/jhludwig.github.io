  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evicted-Poverty-Profit-American-City/dp/0553447459">Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City</a> by Matthew Desmond. Whew what a tough read. We have been so fortunate to always have access to housing and family in our lives. Life for people at the bottom of the housing ladder is horrific. inhuman, even in our “modern” society. Good chapter at end on what kind of remedies we should support, we clearly need to do more.</li>
