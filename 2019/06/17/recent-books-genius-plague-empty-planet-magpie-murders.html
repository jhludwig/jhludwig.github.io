  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Plague-David-Walton-ebook/dp/B01MT6ZAS5">The Genius Plague</a> by David Walton. Award Winner, and has some great concepts, but wasn’t an amazing story. Fun but forgettable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empty-Planet-Global-Population-Decline-ebook/dp/B07CWHYVW5">Empty Planet</a> by Darrell Bricker and John Ibbitson.  Very interesting book about declining birth rates and the implications for us.  No real conclusions but thought provoking.  There are some vitriolic reviews on Amazon claiming bias, and as you read the reviews, it is clear the reviewers are heavily biased, which just made me more interested in the book.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magpie-Murders-Novel-Anthony-Horowitz-ebook/dp/B01M1G8JQE">Magpie Murders</a> by Anthony Horowitz.  Good but not great.  I love books that play with structure, but this didn’t really go anywhere with the concept.</li>
