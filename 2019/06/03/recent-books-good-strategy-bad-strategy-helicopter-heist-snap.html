  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC">Good Strategy Bad Strategy</a> by Richard Rumelt. I hate pop business books but this book does not belong in that category. A timeless approach to the basics of strategy, whether in business or any other setting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Helicopter-Heist-Novel-Based-Events/dp/1590519507">The Helicopter Heist</a> by Jonas Bonnier. Gripping, the last half of the book was a rollercoaster. Looking forward to rumored Netflix treatment.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plotters-Novel-Kim-ebook/dp/B07CWDMQ45">The Plotters</a> by Un-su Kim. Thriller, a little surreal, even a bit of a parable. Interesting tho not something I would want to diet steadily on.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snap-Belinda-Bauer-ebook/dp/B075VDP295">Snap</a> by Belinda Bauer. The cover claims this book is long listed for the Man Booker Prize, and that is normally the kiss of death for me, I find the winners to be unreadable. But this is a great thriller and a lot of fun.</li>
