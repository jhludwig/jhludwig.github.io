  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bannerless-Saga-Carrie-Vaughn/dp/0544947304">Bannerless</a> by Carrie Vaughn. Excellent detective tale set in a future America devastated by ecological change. The protagonist is an investigator who travels town to town, and finds herself caught up in a mystery that drags up issues from her own past.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Order-Day-Eric-Vuillard/dp/1590519698">The Order of the Day</a> by Eric Vuillard. Short history of the events leading up to the German invasion of Austria. Literary, lyrical, almost whimsical in its writing, tho undercut by the great tragedy that was unfolding. And of course the book offers pointed lessons for our own time. Easy to see why this book has won so many honors.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Here-There-Everywhere-Recording-Beatles-ebook/dp/B000OVLIQU">Here, There, and Everywhere</a> by Geoff Emerick. A personal and much more human look at the Beatles career by one of the few people who were in the room with them a lot. The book is not without bias, but still super interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/IQ-Novel-Joe-Ide/dp/0316267724">IQ</a> by Joe Ide. Fantastic first novel featuring Isaiah Quintabe, a high school dropout working cases in LA for friends and associates. Great character, great setting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electric-State-Simon-Stålenhag-ebook/dp/B07CMMH9N1">The Electric State</a> by Simon Stålenhag. Exceptional story/art/graphic novel about a strange future/alternative America, where we have let technology run amok. The art is so integral to the story, I can’t imagine the Kindle version is worth buying.</li>
