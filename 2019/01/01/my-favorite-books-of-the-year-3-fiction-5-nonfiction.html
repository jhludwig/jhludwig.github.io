<p>I just reviewed all my books I read over the last year. Here are the ones that stick with me.</p>

<p>Fiction:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Systems-Red-Murderbot-Diaries/dp/0765397536">All Systems Red</a> by Martha Wells. The first in a super fun science fiction series</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Still-Life-Louise-Penny/dp/0312541538">Still life</a> by Louise Penny. The first in her series featuring Inspector Gamache, every entry I’ve read in the series is great.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Committee-Members-Julie-Schumacher/dp/0345807332">Dear Committee Members</a> by Julie Schumacher. Hilarious series of letters from a disgruntled professor</li>
</ul>

<p>On the nonfiction side:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-Lakes/dp/0393355551">The Death and Life of the Great Lakes</a> by Dan Egan. Won’t be everyone’s cup of tea but if you’ve spent time on the lakes, worth a read</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darkening-Age-Christian-Destruction-Classical/dp/0544800885">The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World</a> by Catherine Nixey. Probably will upset some readers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</a> by John Carreyrou. Wow, so much bad behavior by so many people.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Trump-Touches-Dies-Republican/dp/1982103124">Everything Trump Touches Dies: A Republican Strategist Gets Real About the Worst President Ever</a> by Rick Wilson. Lots of competition for books shining a light on our current “President”, this was my favorite.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Command-Control-Damascus-Accident-Illusion/dp/0143125788">Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety</a> by Eric Schlosser. Wow we have had so many near misses. And this is nuclear weapons – how much slop and error is there in other governmental and corporate processes (say, drug testing) where the stakes are much lower?</li>
</ul>
