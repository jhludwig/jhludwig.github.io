  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Fracture-Daniel-T-Rodgers-ebook/dp/B004Z17I8M">Age of Fracture</a> by Daniel Rodgers. I really really wanted to like this book, it is well-regarded and seems to have an interesting thesis about what has happened in the last 50 years in our country. But overly wordy and repetitive, I just couldnâ€™t stay with.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Responses-Organizations/dp/0674276604">Exit, Voice and Loyalty</a> by Albert Hirschman. What a difference from the work above. Tight, focused arguments with detailed supporting notes, with clear economic thinking. Really enjoyed this, a lot of insight into company behavior and political party behavior. Very nice.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Medusa-Uploaded-Novel-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B0756K6X32">Medusa Uploaded</a> by Emily Devenport. Starts out super strong, a laborer on a generation ship stumbles into layers and waves of conspiracy. But flags in the last third.</li>
