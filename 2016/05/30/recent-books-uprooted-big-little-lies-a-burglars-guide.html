Highly praised, but it felt to me like the author was trying very hard to be literary. I stuck with it, but it didn’t really move me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Uprooted-Naomi-Novik-ebook/dp/B00KUQIU7O">Uprooted</a> by Naomi Novik. A captivating tale of a young witch coming of age and getting drawn into an existential threat for her homeland. Really loved it, deserves the accolades.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Little-Lies-Liane-Moriarty-ebook/dp/B00HDMMISA">Big Little Lies</a> by Liane Moriarty. Completely fun story of conflicts between parents at a preschool, hilarious but serious. Apparently coming to HBO, this will be fun</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burglars-Guide-City-Geoff-Manaugh-ebook/dp/B00V35U0TM">A Burglar’s Guide To The City</a> by Geoff Manaugh. A look at how burglars use urban design and building design to achieve their goals. Would have been even better with more anecdotes, but still interesting</li>
