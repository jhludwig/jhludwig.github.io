  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Rise-Novel-J-G-Ballard/dp/0871404028">High-Rise</a> by J. G. Ballard. <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/05/recent-books-high-rise-travelers-song-machine-the-whites-electric-barracuda/eb/"><img src="images/eb.jpg" alt="eb" /></a>The community in a modern high-rise starts to fall apart in “Lord of the Flies” fashion…actually “Lord of the Flies” seems pretty tame after this.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Travelers-Novel-Chris-Pavone/dp/0385348487">The Travelers</a> by Chris Pavone. A travel writer is coopted and stumbles into a job as a spy, and slowly learns that nothing is as it seems in his life. Fun.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Song-Machine-Inside-Hit-Factory/dp/0393241920">The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory</a> by John Seabrook. No surprise here, pop music is largely a manufactured product.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whites-Novel-Richard-Price/dp/0312621302">The Whites</a> by Richard Price. Couldn’t finish. Supposedly a gritty police drama but kind of dull.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Electric-Barracuda-Novel-Serge-Storms/dp/0061876917">Electric Barracuda</a> by Tim Dorsey. I generally don’t like farce, but there is something endearing about this character – a wise-cracking serial killer with a heart of gold.</li>
