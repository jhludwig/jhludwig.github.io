<p>I needed some escapism.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Games-novel-Roger-Hobbs/dp/0385352646">Vanishing Games</a> by Roger Hobbs. Pirates, Macau, Diamonds, Counterfeiting, high bodycount. Fun but not distinctive.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/02/recent-books-vanishing-games-hades-forty-thieves-planetfall/planetfall/"><img src="images/planetfall.jpg" alt="planetfall" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hades-Archer-Bennett-Thriller-Candice-ebook/dp/B00Q325UCM">Hades</a> by Candice Fox. Cops with dark pasts taking the law into their own hands. Also a high body count.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forty-Thieves-Thomas-Perry/dp/0802124526">Forty Thieves</a> by Thomas Perry. Now this was more fun, a husband/wife PI team run into a husband/wife assassin team, both trying to resolve a cold case. Bullets fly.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Planetfall-Emma-Newman/dp/0425282392">Planetfall</a> by Emma Newman. Ok this started out slow, a group of colonists on a new planet, but it went very strange, with a strange alien experience, and twisted humans.</li>
</ul>
