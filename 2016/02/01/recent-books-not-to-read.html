<p>My last batch of books were very good, and so my bar is raised. I couldn’t get through either of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Witch-Lime-Street-Seduction-Houdini/dp/0307451062">The Witch of Lime Street</a>” by David Jaher. This gets great reviews, but is incredibly choppy, and the characters are unappealing, or to be precise, the author does a poor job of introducing them in appealing fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning-Machine/dp/0465065708">The Master Algorithm</a> by Pedro Domingos. This falls into the classic trap that many books of this type fall into – in its attempt to make a technical topic more interesting to a broader audience, it dumbs down its treatment of the topic, and is simplistic and repetitive. And so pushes away readers who have more background. It is obviously hard to achieve the right balance, I could not stay with this book.</li>
</ul>
