  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doubters-Almanac-Novel-Ethan-Canin-ebook/dp/B00X2FDZ70">A Doubter’s Almanac</a> by Ethan Canin<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/03/recent-books-a-doubters-almanac-dragon-day-the-alchemist-of-souls-all-the-birds-in-the-sky-chimera-the-victoria-vanishes/almanac/"><img src="images/almanac.jpeg" alt="almanac" /></a>. Fantastic story of a misanthropic obsessive genius and how he impacted family and friends around him. An incredibly unlikeable and yet sympathetic main character. Very good.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Day-Ellie-McEnroe-Novel-ebook/dp/B00RKQ657E">Dragon Day</a> by Lisa Brackmann. Solid detective tale set in modern day China, where it seems everyone is out for their own advantage, and justice is a hard thing to find.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Souls-Nights-Masque-ebook/dp/B005411EL4">The Alchemist of Souls</a> by Anne Lyle. Fantasy set in the early days of the New World exploration, with a New World quite different than ours, peopled by a non-human race. Entertaining, not sure I am driven to keep up with the series tho.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Birds-Charlie-Jane-Anders-ebook/dp/B00W190RPG">All the Birds in the Sky</a> by Charlie Jane Anders. It’s the end of the world, maybe, and two childhood friends come together to save it, one with a deep science background, one with a deep mystical background. Good characters but I felt it kind of dissolved into mystical goo.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chimera-Parasitology-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B00X47ZY9S">Chimera</a> by Mira Grant. The last in a 3 book series about semi-intelligent and autonomous tapeworms invading human beings. OK it was fun at times but probably 1 book too long.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Victoria-Vanishes-Peculiar-Crimes-Mystery-ebook/dp/B0013TPXD6">The Victoria Vanishes</a> by Christopher Fowler. Fun tale of two aging detectives investigating a very very strange set of murders. I’ve read another in series, solid characters.</li>
