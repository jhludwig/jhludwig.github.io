  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Season-Broken-Earth/dp/0316229296">The Fifth Season</a> by N. K. Jemison. A small set of related characters finding their way on a far-future(?) Earth peopled by humans and human derivatives, littered with the artifacts of past civilizations, undergoing yet another seismic/volcanic reshaping. Of course there is some conspiracy at work. Good tale, characters dealing with painful issues.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/06/recent-books-29/connectography/"><img src="images/connectography.jpg" alt="connectography" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Connectography-Mapping-Future-Global-Civilization/dp/0812988558">Connectography</a> by Parag Khanna. How the world is moving beyond nation-states to clusters driven by interconnectivity. Well written and a lot of maps, and I am a sucker for maps.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruins-Gorlan-Rangers-Apprentice-Book/dp/0142406635">The Ruins of Gorlan</a> by John A. Flanagan. Pretty standard YA fantasy, but fun nevertheless. I’d read more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Call-Novel-Yannick-Murphy-ebook/dp/B004MMEIVE">The Call</a> by Yannick Murphy. Eh, what started out as a clever structural gadget became tiring. I am a little curious to know what happens to the family but I gave up.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Novel-Kate-Atkinson-ebook/dp/B008TUQ60G">Life After Life</a> by Kate Atkinson. I like Atkinson, but this book also became tiresome, tho I managed to finish. But I’d recommend a different Atkinson.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farthing-Small-Change-Jo-Walton-ebook/dp/B002LA0ANO">Farthing</a> by Jo Walton. How did I miss this? Conspiracy, murder in the English countryside in an alternative history where Britain made peace with the Nazis. Excellent.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Those-Who-Wish-Me-Dead-ebook/dp/B00FPQA76Q">Those Who Wish Me Dead</a> by Michael Koryta. A boy witnesses a murder, and, well, shit happens. Fun but not memorable.</li>
