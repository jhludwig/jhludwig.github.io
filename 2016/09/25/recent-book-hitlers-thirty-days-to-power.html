A very very good book and perhaps relevant read, the detailed story of Hitler’s precipitous rise to power, and how he was enabled by inaction or self-serving actions of the politicians around him. The idea that he would be held in check by more conventional politicians around him was a historically tragic error.</p>

<p>Worth reading. One of my all-time favorite history books. Worth reflecting on.</p>
