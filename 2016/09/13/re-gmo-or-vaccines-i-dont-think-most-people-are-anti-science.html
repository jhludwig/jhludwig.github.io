<p>What they are is anti-science establishment; they have lost trust in a science establishment that has allowed itself to be swayed by moneyed interests.</p>

<p>Consider <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html">today’s news on the sugar industry</a>:</p>

  <p>“They were able to derail the discussion about sugar for decades,” said Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at U.C.S.F. and an author of the JAMA paper.</p>

<p>There is just as much money swirling around pharma and around agriculture, you can bet that the science storyline has been distorted by this money. And that is what people are really saying when it comes to GMO or vaccines – they want to believe the science, but they can no longer trust the science establishment to tell an unbiased story. And science with a pre-determined agenda is no longer science.</p>

<p>We need a re-opening of science. We need far more transparency about funding. We need more funding independent of commercial interests. We need more open results – this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/28/eu-ministers-2020-target-free-access-scientific-papers">EU proposal</a> seems like a good thing. Above all, we need the science community to recognize the problem it has created, the loss of faith it has created through its own actions, and to take charge of healing itself.</p>
