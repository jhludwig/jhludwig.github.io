  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Choice-Alejandro-Zambra/dp/0143109197">Multiple Choice</a> by Alejandro Zambra. From the text – “You read books that are much stranger than the books you would write if you wrote.” – and that about sums it up. This is not for everyone, but I happen to like books that play with the structure of books. But don’t blame me if you buy it and say “WTF is this? Why would anyone read such a thing or write such a thing?”</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Dead-Journey-Through-World-ebook/dp/B0176M3ZP6">Playing Dead: A Journal Through the World of Death Fraud</a> by Elizabeth Greenwood. Don’t do it, the insurers will get you every time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Salvager-Wesley-Chu-ebook/dp/B00NKB9RSW">Time Salvager</a> by Wesley Chu. Eh, pretty forgettable space opera.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Other-Lies-Novel-ebook/dp/B00P42WU0C">The Truth and Other Lies</a> by Sascha Arango. Nice little tale of psychopaths, murder, plots.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Let-You-Go-Clare-Mackintosh-ebook/dp/B013D669UC">I Let You Go</a> by Clare Mackintosh. Twisty in a way I did not expect at all. Nice read.</li>
