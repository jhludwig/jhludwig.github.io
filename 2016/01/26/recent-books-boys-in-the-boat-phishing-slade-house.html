Recommended by almost everyone else in the family, this is a great tale of the UW crew team which went to the Berlin Olympics. Especially interesting probably to Seattle residents, but very well written. I had no idea that crew was such a popular sport at the time.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phishing-Phools-Economics-Manipulation-Deception/dp/0691168318">Phishing for Phools</a> by George Akerlof and Robert Shiller. OK I have great empathy for the material, an expose of how we are manipulated and deceived (and how we buy into this). But the book honestly was a little thin, I would have liked more examples and depth.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slade-House-Novel-David-Mitchell/dp/0812998685">Slade House</a> by David Mitchell. Lord can this man write, I love everything he touches. A great creepy haunted house tale, written in the Mitchell style. Hard to put down.</li>
