<p>I read a lot, online and offline, fiction and nonfiction. First time I’ve run across “<a href="http://www.dmtk.io/word2vec_multi.html#p0">polysemous</a>”. I guess I should be impressed, tho if you need words like this to describe what your software does, you might need to scrub your messaging some more</p>
