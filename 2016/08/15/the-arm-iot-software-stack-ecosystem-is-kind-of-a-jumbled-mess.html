<p>Google has announced <a href="https://developers.google.com/brillo/">Brillo</a> which leverages Android and Linux. But no, wait, now there is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/13/google-fuchsia-operating-system/">Google Fuchsia</a> because apparently Linux isn’t good enough. On the pi there are a jillion variants of linux to use, but with glaring holes (general purpose gpu, docker for instance). ARM has <a href="https://www.mbed.com/en/platform/mbed-os/">mbed</a> tho it is really targetted at low end devices. You can try <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot">Windows 10</a>. And all of these require a lot of laborious tinkering.</p>

<p>To say nothing of the cloud, the services for managing ARM devices are even more nascent or non-existent.</p>

<p>You have to wonder what Softbank is going to do about this. A $32B hardware bet needs a corresponding software and services bet.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="https://twitter.com/natbro">Nat</a> reminds me that I didn’t even mention toolchains! Cross-compilers, QEMU, etc – there is so much fun in here!</p>
