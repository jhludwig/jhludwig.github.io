<p>I was asked this recently. I draw from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/section/books?action=click&amp;contentCollection=arts&amp;region=navbar&amp;module=collectionsnav&amp;pagetype=sectionfront&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">NYTimes Sunday Book Reviews</a>. I especially enjoy the “By The Book” column, in which a living author talks about what they have read and are reading. Always some things off the beaten path there.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/reviews/">LA Times</a> book reviews are useful as well.</li>
  <li>Various prize lists – Hugo, Nebula, Man Booker, Pulitzer, Nobel, Edgar. Tho I have found the Nobel prize winners to be rough rough going.</li>
  <li>Goodreads reviews and Amazon reviews. If a book doesn’t get great consensus reviews (or at least a strong positive rating from a subset of readers), I probably won’t read.</li>
  <li>I have a couple coworkers/friends who are big readers and I listen to their recos, and my college roommate is a voracious and critical reader, and I listen to him. And then anything that a family member recommends, I will consider.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will read just about any genre with a couple limitations. I find most popular business books to be horrible – 1 or 2 good ideas that are worthy of an article, but nothing worthy of a book. And I do not enjoy farce in any genre, just not my thing.</p>
