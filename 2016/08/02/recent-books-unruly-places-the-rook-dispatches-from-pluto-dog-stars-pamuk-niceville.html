  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unruly-Places-Spaces-Inscrutable-Geographies/dp/054410157X">Unruly Places</a> by <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/recent-books-unruly-places-the-rook-dispatches-from-pluto-dog-stars-pamuk-niceville/pluto/"><img src="images/pluto.jpg" alt="pluto" /></a>Alastair Bonnett. The stories behind some of the most unusual and unlikely places on the globe – places belonging to no nation, to many nations, floating, underground, in the sky – and an understanding of the meaning and importance of place.  Enjoyable.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rook-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316098809">The Rook</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stiletto-Novel-Files-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316228044">Stiletto</a> by Daniel O’Malley. Great suspenseful adventure in a world filled with magic –  kind of a grown-up Harry Potter milieu.  The first page grabs you – the protagonist awakens with no memory, in a park surrounded by bodies, and in her pocket is a note that says “Read Me”. Stiletto isn’t quite as strong but still a fund read.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dispatches-Pluto-Found-Mississippi-Delta-ebook/dp/B00UDCNM82">Dispatches From Pluto</a> by Richard Grant. An English adventure writer decides to settle in the Mississippi Delta. Interesting look at the culture and issues of a part of the country that seems almost foreign to me.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Stars-Peter-Heller-ebook/dp/B007GZELF2">The Dog Stars</a> by Peter Heller. A different kind of post-apocalyptic novel, the world has largely been emptied out, a very few people try to find their way and remain human.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangeness-my-Mind-novel-ebook/dp/B00SPVZA4C">A Strangeness In My Mind</a> by Orhan Pamuk. Tried to lift my literary sights, but as always, “Nobel Prize Winning” does not equal “interesting”.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Niceville-Trilogy-Vintage-Crime-Lizard/dp/030774535X">Niceville</a> by Carsten Stroud. Not a nice place. Solid horror/mystery.</li>
</ul>
