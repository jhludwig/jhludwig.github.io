<p>In this yearâ€™s battle of one-off kitchen tools: The <a href="http://www.slotdog.com/">SlotDog</a> kind of smashes your hotdog, but it does seem to work, the hotdogs are attractive and tasty. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watermelon-Slicer-Corer-Server-STAINLESS/dp/B01AV1WVNG">watermelon slicer</a> is pretty erratic, it mostly just smashes your watermelon and produces a lot of oddly shaped pieces and juice. A sharp knife is a much better tool.</p>
