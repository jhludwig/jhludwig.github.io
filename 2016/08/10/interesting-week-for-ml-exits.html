<p>Congrat’s to Seattle’s <a href="https://turi.com/">Turi</a>, acquired by Apple. And congrats to <a href="https://www.nervanasys.com">Nervana</a> and to Brad and Chris at <a href="http://www.fuelcapital.com/">Fuel</a>, in what seems to be a great exit. The markups on ML companies are tremendous – not surprising given the dramatic impact ML is having.</p>

<p>I’d expect to see many more dramatic ML exits.</p>
