<p>We always buy some board games for the Christmas period and play them in the evening. Started the practice years ago with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MayFair-Games-4102480-Settlers-Catan/dp/B000W7JWUA/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=toys-and-games&amp;qid=1230268789&amp;sr=8-1">Settlers of Catan</a> which remains the gold standard.  This year we tried:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>[Hanging Gardens, The</td>
          <td>BoardGameGeek](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/34707). OK it seems like this could be a fun game and we started to enjoy it, but the game exploded into a major argument about the rules. The rulebook is not the strongest.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/31999">Tzaar</a> – fun and quick, but only two player. It is part of some series of games called <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/project_GIPF">Project GIPF</a> that interrelate in some fashion, need to learn more about</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/33154">Wasabi!</a> – some liked, some did not. The winner liked, shockingly. I thought it was fun tho I pissed everyone off by playing the Wasabi! card late in the which really put the brakes on the action.  Late in the game, gameplay really slows down as the board gets cluttered which is a problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Settlers is still the best but these were all entertaining</p>
