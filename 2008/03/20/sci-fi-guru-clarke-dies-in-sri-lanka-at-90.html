<p><a href="http://www.physorg.com/news125088012.html">Sci-fi guru Clarke dies in Sri Lanka at 90</a> – sad. My lifelong passion for reading was kickstarted by Clarke, Asimov, Heinlein, Herbert – all gone. Not all of their work has aged well but “Rendezvous with Rama”:amazon is a killer read to this day.</p>
