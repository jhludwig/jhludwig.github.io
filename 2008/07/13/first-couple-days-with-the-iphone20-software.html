<p>After <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2008/07/iphone-servers-crumble-under-activation-strain/">activation woes</a>, the experience has been pretty good. The things I like:</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange" title="Microsoft Exchange Server">Exchange</a> support. Wasn’t completely obvious how to enable. You have to delete your old imap/webdav email account info, and create a new Exchange account type, and turn on the cal and contact synching. It will wipe all your on-device cal and contact info so sync up first! Getting the entourage/ical sync disaster out of my config is a very good thing. * The App store. nice selection, a lot of good choices, and seems to work well. Apps I like so far: ** Urbanspoon. The interface is just cool ** GuitarToolkit. Chord reference and tuner, very nice ** Todo. Integrates nicely with <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">RememberTheMilk</a> for a complete app and website experience. Jott is great too with the nice voice interface but Todo wins for the rememberthemilk integration ** SmugShot. Replaces the iPhone camera and photo apps, and is integrated with <a href="http://www.smugmug.com">SmugMug</a></p>

<p>Things that aren’t doing it for me:</p>

<p>* What is the new Contacts app for? Seems like a subset of the phone app * The Google app. Not really clear what value this adds beyond the existing search in Safari * Games. They look nice but the interface limitations of the device really hurt. I won’t get rid of my DS. * Still no cut and paste?? Am I missing this somewhere?</p>
