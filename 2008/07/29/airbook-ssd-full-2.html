<p>Not sure why, the Mac Airbook SSD was reporting full.  Tried to delete a bunch of apps, nothing seemed to help.  I kind of wonder if it isn’t a time machine problem. I don’t have great OSX intuition and so an examination of the directory structure and process list didn’t really mean much to me.</p>

<p>Decided to just reinstall the OS.  40G free again.  we’ll see what happens.  <a href="http://www.igncap.com/team/">Rennie</a> pointed me towards <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnidisksweeper/download/">The Omni Group - OmniDiskSweeper - Download</a> or <a href="www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html">Tinkertool</a> as decent utilities to use if it happens again.</p>
