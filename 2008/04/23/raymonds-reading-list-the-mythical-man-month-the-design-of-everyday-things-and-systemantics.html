<p>Great recos from Raymond – <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/16/8398400.aspx">The Old New Thing : Raymond’s reading list: The Mythical Man-Month, The Design of Everyday Things, and Systemantics</a> – I’ve never read the last but need to get it. The Mythical Man Month is awesome and if Systemantics is as good, then well worth reading.</p>
