I’d actually use the headlamp * <a href="http://toolmonger.com/2008/04/15/easy-roaster/">Easyroaster</a>. Cool but I don’t really like hotdogs or smores. * <a href="http://www.brettonstuff.com/index.php/backpacking/yaktrax-traction-control/">Yaktrax traction control</a>. I rarely try to hike on snow. * <a href="http://www.brettonstuff.com/index.php/backpacking/mini-tissue/">Mini Tissues</a>. Just because I like the rehydration aspect. * <a href="http://www.brettonstuff.com/index.php/backpacking/sea-to-summit-dry-bag/">Lightweight drybags</a>. Maybe I should just pay Brett to outfit me. * <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/03/03/carbon-fiber-tripods-from-manfrotto/">Carbon fiber tripods</a>.
