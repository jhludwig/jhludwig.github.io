<p>Been on planes a lot recently – first installment of reviews here – the Kindle is awesome while flying</p>

<p>* “Buckingham Palace Gardens”:amazon by Anne Perry. Period mystery set in Buckingham palace. Very good tale of ambition, murder, deception, class conflict, and passion. Great fun, worth reading more by the author. * “Off Armageddon Reef”:amazong by David Weber. “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court”:amazon starts the Reformation in a backwater planet, with a lot of “Master and Commander”:amazon high seas action, set against a space opera background. Whew. Too much naval tactics at times but fun. * “Curse of the Spellmans”:amazon by Lisa Lutz. “Harriet the Spy”:amazon grows up and is a bumbling PI and somewhat of a misanthrope but in a humorous way. Entertaining.</p>
