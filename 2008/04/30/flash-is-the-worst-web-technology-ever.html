<p>We are planning some remodelling and trying to exchange ideas with our designers. I know that the people who design websites for all the furniture industry mean well, and their sites look cool, but they are usability disasters. there is no way to send links back and forth to items we like because all the content is embedded deep in flash animations. <a href="http://www.kraftmaid.com/">KraftMaid Cabinetry</a>, <a href="http://www.ikea.com">IKEA</a> are great examples – we find a set of cabinets we like, and we have to tell our collaborators to go search for the item themselves. oh and of course there is no search function.</p>

<p>If searchable, linkable, plain old HTML is good enough for Amazon, the number one web retailer, how is it that it isn’t good enough for all the rest of these guys.</p>
