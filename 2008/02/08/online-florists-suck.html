<p>I’ve had it with 1800flowers, with proflowers, with marthastewart’s site. In the past year I’ve ordered flowers from each and they have all resulted in various disasters – flowers never arrived, arrived damaged, or were pathetically bad.</p>

<p>From now on I am dealing with real human beings at local florists. <a href="mailto:http://www.lindvallflorist.com/">Lindvall florist</a> in Florida, <a href="http://www.marionflowershop.com/">Marion Flower Shop</a> in Ohio.</p>

<p>This points out a large flaw in current SEO-crazed environment – pissing away a lot of money on SEO and SEM is pointless if you can’t back it up with a solid operation. You need to do something well, something of real value, before you start trying to slurp up traffic.</p>
