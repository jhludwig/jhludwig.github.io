<p><a href="http://www.greenpdf.com/graphics/TheGreenPDFRevolution.pdf">GreenPDF</a> has a ton of info about the carbon costs of paper, fun to read. i am not sure why they commingle the message with PDF adoption, that seems strange, but the numbers are fun. we’ve invested in a couple companies that combat the use of paper – <a href="http://www.docusign.com/">Docusign</a>, <a href="http://www.earthclassmail.com/">Earth Class Mail</a> – so I feel kind of good that we are helping to fight the good fight</p>
