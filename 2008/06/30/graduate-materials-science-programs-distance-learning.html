<p>I started taking graduate matsci courses several years ago at the UW via the <a href="http://www.engr.washington.edu/edge/">Edge program</a>, and also took some on campus. I have found it hard to continue though as the UW materials science school doesn’t have a deep schedule, and they have decommitted from the distance learning effort. So I am shopping for other programs.</p>

<p>Columbia’s program – <a href="http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/">CVN - Columbia Video Network</a> – seems to be among the most complete with a full schedule of courses. And they offer a full MS degree via online. And you can start as a non-matriculated student. <a href="http://www.distancelearning.ufl.edu/program.aspx?p=29">Florida</a> has a program as well. And so does <a href="http://den.usc.edu/programs/index.htm">USC</a>, tho the courses offered is a smaller slate than Columbia’s.</p>
