<p>Rented a flick on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unbox-Video-Downloads/b/ref=sa_menu_atv2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16261631&amp;pf_rd_p=328655101&amp;pf_rd_s=left-nav-1&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_i=507846&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=180W0KEVKR7C1MVYYFW2">Amazon Unbox</a> last night â€“ it downloaded fine to my Tivo and it looked fine, but the 24 hour exploding limitation is beyond stupid. We regularly watch a movie on two nights running, half each night, but this is impossible with Unbox rentals thanks to the fact that the movie explodes in 24 hours. I can pay the same price and buy a movie off Tivo PPV and keep it forever. This unbox thing will be a failure until Amazon can get DRM straightened out.</p>
