<p><a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/06/the-lost-space.html">NASA space colonies</a> – awesome, I remember these pix from back in the day, very inspiring.</p>

<p>My other strange space link of the day – something about <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/06/03/a-conversation-with-john-buckman-about-nazi-invaders-from-the-moon-and-other-things/">Nazi invaders from the moon</a>. I too would watch any movie with this premise in a minute.</p>
