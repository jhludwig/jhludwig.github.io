I heartily agree with the idea of getting to all electric as soon as possible. We need an Apollo-like program – we need the leadership to propose it and to get everyone focused on it. The whole country focused on the July 20 1969 Apollo landing and rallied around it – we can do the same around the date of the last tanker docking at our shores from overseas.</p>

<p>As I’ve mentioned to some people – there will never be a solar embargo, there will never be a solar cartel, the sun isn’t controlled by governments inimical to our interests, “peak solar” is billions of years away, and solar production economics are going to follow a Moore’s-Law-like curve. What is not to like?</p>
