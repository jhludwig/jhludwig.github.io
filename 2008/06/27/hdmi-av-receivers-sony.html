<p>I’m going to convert sometime in the next 6 months to an HDMI receiver I think – here are some Sony units – <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/06/26/sony-is-adding-three-es-receivers-to-its-2008-line-up/">CrunchGear » Archive » Sony is adding three ES receivers to its 2008 line-up</a> – I am wondering if I have to convert my current TV as well – it doesn’t have HDMI input, only component – will these receivers convert HDMI in to RGB? Need to learn more about the technical and DRM aspects of this.</p>
