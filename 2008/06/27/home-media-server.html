<p>Now that I have a PS3 I want to serve up photos etc to it. Trying to decide between all the choices out there:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://desktop.google.com/plugins/i/mediaserver.html?hl=en">Google’s new media server</a> * <a href="http://www.simplecenter.com/">Free Media Player Streams iTunes, Syncs Content, Converts Video for iPod, PSP and Xbox 360 - SimpleCenter</a> * WMP 11 of course * <a href="http://www.rbgrn.net/blog/2007/06/how-to-set-up-media-servers-for-your-ps3-or-xbox-360.html">One man’s guide to all the choices out there</a> * <a href="http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products/software/EyeConnect.en.html">Eyeconnect</a> seems to be liked on the Mac * or <a href="http://mediatomb.cc/">Mediatomb</a></p>

<p>I have a TON of photos and I need something that will perform well, not clear which of these is the way to go. Time to start experimenting I gues</p>
