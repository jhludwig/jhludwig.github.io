<p>We have these plastic Stockli 7 liter watering cans that we love – but after years of use they are breaking down. I can’t find any US source for them which is a bummer. But these <a href="http://www.dramm.com/html/main.isx?sub=24">Dramm - Watering Cans</a> seem to be an equivalent and are available widely. So we will give them a try – the 7L size are great for outdoor use – big enough to carry a lot of water, but not so big that they are unusable.</p>
