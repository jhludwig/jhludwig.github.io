The short answer: yes. The voters are not going to put OSU into the title game after three straight national stage face plants. The only way a 1-loss OSU gets there is if nearly everybody else has two losses. Realistically OSU’s best outcome this season is the Rose Bowl or a BCS at-large pick. In that game they will have the opportunity to set the table for next year.</p>
