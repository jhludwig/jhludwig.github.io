<p><a href="http://storagemojo.com/2008/09/09/our-changing-file-workloads/">StorageMojo Â» Our changing file workloads</a> Interesting study results. Some of the things that fascinate me:</p>

<p>* Files rarely re-opened. Over 66% are re-opened once and 95% fewer than 5 times. Over 60% of file re-opens are within a minute of the first open. * over 90% of the active storage was untouched during the study</p>

<p>hmm, providing a backup service has to be profitable given this info.</p>
