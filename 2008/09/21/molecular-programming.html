<p><a href="http://www.physorg.com/news138295921.html">Caltech researchers awarded $10M for molecular programming project</a>. UW involved as well.  More info at <a href="http://www.ist.caltech.edu/mpp/">the Molecular Programming Project</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…we will develop new computer science principles for programming information-bearing molecules like DNA and RNA to create artificial biomolecular programs of similar complexity.</p>

  <p>…computing and decision-making will carried out by chemical processes themselves. Through the creation of molecular programming languages, theory for analyzing them, and experiments for validating them, our long-term vision is to establish “molecular programming” as a subdiscipline of computer science</p>

<p>Fascinating stuff.</p>
