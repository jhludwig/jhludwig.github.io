<p>Nice post from Phil pointing out the huge debt incurred by either Obama or McCain plans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The critical thing to consider is the trillions of dollars being added to the national debt ($4.5 trillion over ten years for McCain, $3.2 trillion for Obama) at a time when we are already running deficits and fighting a war. <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2008/09/mcain-obama-tax-cut-comparison/">– Comparing McCain and Obama’s tax cuts: trillions in new debt, small salary impact » Bogle’s Blog</a>.</p>

<p>And don’t forget to add the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac bailouts on top of that, plus any other future bailouts.</p>

<p>Whoever wins this election has an economic mess to work with.</p>
