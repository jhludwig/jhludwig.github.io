<p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LogitechHarmonyOneRemoteControlReview.aspx">Scott Hanselman’s Computer Zen - Logitech Harmony One Remote Control Review</a>. – Nice review of this remote.  It is a pretty good universal remote and I am also pretty happy with.  The one huge problem is lack of bluetooth support to control a PS3 as a DVD player.  But overall a pretty good experience.</p>
