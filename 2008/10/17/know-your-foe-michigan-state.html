<p>What various Sparty’s are saying</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://blog.spartymsu.com/2008/10/16/2008-game-8-msu-vs-ohio-state.aspx">SpartyMSU: 2008 Game 8: MSU vs. Ohio State</a>. “The Spartans match up well in this game…  The Big Mo is with the Green and White”</li>
  <li><a href="http://enlightenedspartan.com/gameday/gameday.htm">The Enlightened Spartan</a>. “Can the Spartan defense contain Pryor enough? YES. Can the Spartan defense cause turnovers and stay steadfast in the red zone? YES. Can the Spartan offense get an efficient game from Hoyer to balance the Ringer running game? YES. What does that mean? Spartan victory.”</li>

<p>Oh and let’s not forget this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvrRvUYRdD8">classic moment from the 05 game</a> in which Sparty lost in classic Sparty fashion.</p>
