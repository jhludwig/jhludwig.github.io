Goodwin St. Prescott AZ ::</a> – awesome tapas place with great margaritas and a great creekside location with indoor or outdoor dining. live music. we had a great time. PS Google Maps and Hertz EverLost both have the wrong location for this restaurant. 316 West Goodwin is right – about a block and a half west of town square on Goodwin.</p>
