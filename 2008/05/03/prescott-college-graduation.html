      <td>For the Liberal Arts and the Environment](http://www.prescott.edu/) graduation and baccalaureate. What amazing ceremonies! Personal words about each student and from each student â€“ amazing passion and diversity. The value of a small personalized college really stands out. When you first visit Prescott, the facilities may not blow you away, but this place has obviously had a powerful and positive impact on the students. Congratulations!</td>
