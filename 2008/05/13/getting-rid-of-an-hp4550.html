<p>I had an <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/DocumentIndex.jsp?contentType=SupportManual&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docIndexId=64179&amp;taskId=101&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=27901">HP4550</a> printer for years that I picked up at a liquidation event. It has been a workhorse but it died in the last 6 months, some ugly hardware problem. The cost to fix would have been 4x the cost of new printer so I just decided to junk it. The problem is, it is huge and weighs like 100 lbs and the recycling guys would have laughed at it. So I spent sunday taking it apart â€“ taking every screw out, every piece apart. My gosh I now understand why this thing was so freaking expensive, hundreds and hundreds of screws and parts. It is now a giant pile of scrap metal and plastic that I can fit in the recycling bin and get rid of. I have new appreciation for the recyclers of the world.</p>
