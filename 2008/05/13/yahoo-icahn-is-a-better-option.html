<p>OK Yahoo could have been a Microsoft division, all of Microsoft’s internet ambitions would have been handed over to them, they would have been able to run semi-autonomously.</p>

<p>Or they can be <a href="http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/Y/YAHOO_ICAHN?SITE=WIRE&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2008-05-13-17-29-00">ripped apart by private equity guys like Icahn</a> – massive layoffs, milking their current traffic levels for cash flow, spinning off parts.</p>

<p>This is preferable? Did Yahoo management not foresee this??</p>
