<p>Sigh been trying to make this work and it looks like it never will – <a href="http://www.fixya.com/support/t360707-networking_mac_xp_computer_kodak_5500">Networking a mac and a xp computer with a kodak 5500 printer - FixYa</a> – apparently a lot of printers don’t support the necessary features for network use from a Mac. So I am going to have to buy another freaking printer – <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306684">official Mac driver support here</a> – you have to make sure you get one with a “modern” driver.</p>

<p>PS Thanks to the <a href="http://www.networkmagic.com">Pure Networks</a> guys for helping me figure this out.</p>
