<p>Bumped into Nick in the pits, driving a car owned by <a href="http://www.cantrellmotorsport.com/">Cantrell Motorsports</a> of Kirkland with a Windows Live sponsorship. Nick was super gracious, let us get a picture in the car, and even offered to take on J as a garage worker tomorrow – a clear step up from flag duty! Someone once said “90% of life is just showing up” and boy is that true.</p>
