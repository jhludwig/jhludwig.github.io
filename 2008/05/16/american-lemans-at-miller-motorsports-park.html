<p>My god what a <a href="http://www.millermotorsportspark.com/eventView.php?event_id=99">facility</a> â€“ brand spanking new, huge, a variety of viewing from plain bleachers to delux clubhouse. Great views from all kinds of places. And the pit activity today is fascinating with 3-4 classes of cars all mixing it up. Worth the trip.</p>
