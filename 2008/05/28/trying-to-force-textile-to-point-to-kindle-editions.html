<p>I use textile to create all my book links in the blog. as a reader pointed out, this unfortunately doesn’t link very directly to the kindle edition of books. So experimenting with textile below:</p>

<p>* “The Story of French”:amazon – this is a textile generated link just using the title * “The Story of French (Kindle)”:amazon – a text with some kindle wordage. oops doesn’t work, when you paren a word it shows up as alternate text and is not sent to amazon as part of the search string * “The Story of French – Kindle”:amazon – another kindle test. this one takes you to a search results page with Kindle edition first * “The Story of Frennch, Kindle Edition”:amazon – another kindle test. blows chunks, doesn’t find any edition of the book</p>

<p>ok so i guess pattern 3 is the best. it is too bad that pattern 2 doesn’t work.</p>
