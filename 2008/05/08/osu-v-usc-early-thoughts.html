<p>Getting geared up for this game already. A classic for so many reasons.</p>

<p>First of all, a great personal history with the Buckeyes – been at their games since I was a kid, we are alums, my father played for <a href="http://www.centralohio.com/ohiostate/football/legacy/coaches/hayes.html">Woody</a>, my grandfather was an alum.</p>

<p>Amd the schools have a great <a href="http://www.jhowell.net/cf/Scores/OhioState.htm">history</a>, particularly in the Rose Bowl. My dad was on the team for the ‘55 win and national championship; I remember the great ‘69 and ‘74 wins, and still suffer from the ‘73, ‘75, ‘80, and ‘85 losses. I hated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McKay_(football_coach)">John McKay</a> and his teams.</p>

<p>In this century, <a href="http://www.jimtressel.com/">Jim Tressel</a> and <a href="http://www.petecarroll.com/">Pete Carroll</a> have arguably been the best coaches with the best programs, albeit stylistically very differently – Tressel is buttoned-up, a solid midwestern values kind of guy. Pete is a flashy new media loosey-goosey kind of guy, and I have hated him.</p>

<p>So a great early season matchup this year, and particularly so, because a family member will now be attending USC! So I am going to have to cheer for the Trojans in every game except the OSU matchup – that is going to take some getting used to.</p>
