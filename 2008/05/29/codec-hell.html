<p>OK I’ve experienced codec hell on Windows, and while the Mac is much much better, as soon as you do something off the beaten path, well it gets complicated. I wanted to use some clips from a commercial DVD in a presentation (gasp!) and after wandering around the forums for a while, I bought the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/mpeg2/">Apple MPEG2 codec</a> and then used <a href="http://www.squared5.com/">MPEG Clipstream</a> to rip the entire DVDs. Then I exported to Quicktime and slurped the movie into iMovie. From there I found the clips I needed, created some small projects, and then exported to several formats for PC viewing – and the target PC only has WMP and I can’t change the software load on it. MPEG4 – too much compression, looked terrible. Various QT formats – some look ok but none would play in WMP. Finally settled on AVI as the format – first used the default cinepack compressor with default settings – worked fine but too much compression! Re-cinepacked at the highest quality settings and looked/worked ok. and then redid as DV-NTSC which also looks/works good but is pretty big.</p>

<p>This would all be so much easier if Apple/MSFT could agree on some basic codec loads for their machines.</p>
