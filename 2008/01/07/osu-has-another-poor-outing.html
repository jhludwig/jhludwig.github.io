<p>Sigh. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger I guess. Will be interesting to see how Tressel dissects this one. LSU is a very good team and OSU would have needed to play at their best, which they did not.</p>

<p>* The undisciplined play by the team certainly was huge. The roughing the punter was a poor decision, and the other fouls were just stupid. * The coaching staff refused to put the game in Beanie’s hands. * And tried to put the game in Boeckman’s hands, which he was clearly not ready for. Yes he made some bad decisions but why was he in a position to even make these decisions? He should have been watching Beanie run the ball.</p>

<p>Oh well. It is a game. You learn more from failure than from success. The Buckeyes are piling up the learnings!</p>
