<p>Recently had some new GFCI outlets installed in my house like these – <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/home_journal_news/3487002.html" title="The Phantom GFCI - Popular Mechanics">The Phantom GFCI - Popular Mechanics</a> – the addition of an LED letting me know if the outlet is live is brilliant! And then I saw this prototype – <a href="http://toolmonger.com/2008/01/29/lights-on-with-the-firelight-safety-switch/">a light switch that responds to smoke alarms</a>. I love the idea of embedding cheap electronics into our electrical system – I’d really love it if somehow my switches and outlets could all report current energy use; that would help me start to change behaviour re conservation.</p>
