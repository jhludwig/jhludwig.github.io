<p>Like many people I have a mess of extra cables – displays, ethernet, usb, sound/speaker of many flavors, firewire, etc etc etc. I used to just keep them in a tangled mess in a drawer.</p>

<p>But I had an unused shoe rack like this one – <a href="http://www.wards.com/wards/prod_display1.asp?DMSIID=82&amp;product=72419" title="Chrome Over-the-Door Shoe Rack">Chrome Over-the-Door Shoe Rack</a> – it is pretty great for storing cables. Lots of ways to hook them over the shoe holders, easy to keep them organized by type, etc.</p>
