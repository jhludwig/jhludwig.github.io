<p><a href="http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/tech/32451" title="Nanowires convert heat to electricity - nanotechweb.org">Nanowires convert heat to electricity - nanotechweb.org</a> – this seems very interesting. the huge amount of electricity we waste as heat is an appealing target. I wonder what savings could be made in general by replacing bulk machined wires and components with nanoengineered parts – as this article suggests, it seems like a lot could be done to improve conductivity and reduce resistivity.</p>
