Me, well, I’m not so sure. Some serious offensive learning and development needs to take place. All the stupid penalty stuff can get fixed easily, and the effort was there.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="http://blog.dispatch.com/buckeyesblog/2008/01/year_in_reviewin_five_sentence.shtml">Columbus Dispatch dudes</a>, I am starting to wonder if the current system is really good for OSU. The 50 day layoff seems to have been better used by LSU and Florida. I am starting to lean towards a gasp playoff, and a Big-10 schedule delayed a week (already happening), to get rid of the layoff and compress prep time for teams.</p>
