<p>I’ve been thinking about HP’s actions – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/09/pretexting.html" title="A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: &quot;Pretexting&quot;">A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: “Pretexting”</a> – and I’ve been wondering – just what is the board of a public company talking about that is so freaking secret? Why do they feel the need to treat a leak like a threat to national security? I really can’t wrap my head around this. I wonder why more board meetings aren’t open like many government proceedings are. I bet that would put a damper on ceo pay abuses among other board missteps.</p>
