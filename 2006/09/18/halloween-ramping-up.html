<p>All my gear and props delivered from <a href="http://www.doortodoor.com/">door  to door storage</a> over the weekend and unpacked today.  I’ve used these guys for storage for 4 years now and they have been great.</p>

<p>Got my pneumatic valves hooked up to <a href="http://www.efx-tek.com/topics/prop-1.html">EFX-TEK :: Prop-1 Controller</a>. This is my planned controller strategy this year. Seems to work just great – I don’t have air hooked up yet but the valves are all click-clacking away under program control.</p>

<p>Also got my <a href="http://www.i-zombie.com/">i-zombie lighting controllers</a> today. As is obvious, I am moving away a little from pc-based control this year and towards a bunch of discrete systems – easier to debug, harder to manage.</p>

<p>Oh and <a href="http://www.scaredy-cat.com/bio.html">Scott</a> graciously showed me some of his past work – awesome. I am really motivated to give the axworthy ghost another try tho I may not have the time this year.</p>
