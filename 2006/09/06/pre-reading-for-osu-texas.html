<p>OK I know OSU played a game last weekend but really, the season starts this weekend. Here is my prereading:</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://www.buckeyextra.com/">Columbus Dispatch</a> site of course. Most of their stuff is posted daily first thing in the morning. * <a href="http://tresselsworld.blogspot.com/">Tressel’s World.</a> M-rated, definitely not for the kiddies, and may piss off some OSU fans, but I find it freaking hilarious. * <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/longhorns/index.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> for the Texas view. * Longhorn blogs - <a href="http://www.bevosports.com/">bevosports</a>, <a href="http://www.burntorangenation.com/">Burnt Orange Nation</a> * <a href="http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/">Every Day Should Be Saturday</a> for general college football goodness * And <a href="http://mgoblog.blogspot.com/">M Go Blog</a> to get just generally pissed off at Michigan, because it doesn’t matter who we are playing, “F@$% Michigan” is still a good sentiment.</p>
