<p>Apparently I have failed to link to the system I use for my primary fog system at halloween â€“ <a href="http://www.fogmachines.com">fogmachines</a>. The system hasbeen trouble-free for me for years and puts out a ton of fog. It is very wet of course, but then it is usually wet around here at Halloween anyway</p>
