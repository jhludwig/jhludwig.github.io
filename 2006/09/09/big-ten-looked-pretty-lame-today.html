<p>Of course the Buckeyes looked brilliant in beating Texas in Texas as expected. So all is basically right with the world. But look at the rest of these outcomes – <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/scoreboard/BIG10/2006/week2" title="NCAA Football Scoreboard - CBS SportsLine.com">NCAA Football Scoreboard - CBS SportsLine.com</a></p>

<p>* Wisconsin seemed to win handily over a weak opponent, they can feel good. * Michigan and Michigan State won by big margins over weak opponents – but each gave up a lot of first half points. * Iowa, Purdue, and Indiana struggled to win against clearly inferior opponents. I guess Indiana should feel good about any victory. * Penn State and Minnesota thumped by top 25 teams. * and Illinois and Northwestern thumped by weak opponents.</p>

<p>After the 11-0 Big Ten start last week I was feeling pretty good about the league. Not so much now.</p>
