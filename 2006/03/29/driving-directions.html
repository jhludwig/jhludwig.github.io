<p>I love <a href="maps.google.com">google maps</a> and <a href="www.mapquest.com">mapquest</a>, but if you are planning a multi-leg road trip – say for instance visiting 8 colleges and universities over 4 days – <a href="http://www.aaawa.com/maps_resources/triptik.asp">AAA triptiks</a> are still pretty darn useful. They make it easy to specify multiple stops, save your plans and try variants, and they print out pretty well. I joined AAA for other reasons, I’m not sure I would pay the fee just for triptiks, but if you are already a member, worth trying.</p>
