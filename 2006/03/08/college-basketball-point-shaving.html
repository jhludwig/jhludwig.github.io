<p>The <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2006_03_01__arch_file.htm#114182749418260435">Sports Economist discusses</a> today’s NY Times article on the evidence for point shaving in NCAA basketball. Really, is it any surprise that 18-21 year olds can be swayed by a few thousand bucks, when they are working in an industry which generates hundreds of millions in revenues, none of which goes to them? Can you blame them?</p>

<p>Until the adults involved in college sports (the networks, schools, the ncaa, the sponsors) quit stuffing their own pockets and start sharing the revenues equitably with the people creating the value, leakages like this will happen.</p>

<p>Rant off.</p>
