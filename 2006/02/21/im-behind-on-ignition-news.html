<p>* Congrats to the <a href="http://www.judysbook.com">Judy’s Book team</a> on their site relaunch. A new look – the new page for nonmembers is great. The ability to simultaneously post to JB and to your blog is awesome – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">rich</a> has been doing a lot of. I’m way behind Rich on posting volume but working to ratchet my rate up. (I’m on the board of directors). * Congrats to the <a href="http://www.qimingventures.com/">Qiming team</a> for the launch of their first fund. An Ignition partnership, some of my partners will be spending a LOT of time there. <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2006/02/17/new_venture_firm_qiming_venture_partners.html">John discusses</a>, <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/family/geek/qiming_ventures.php">Rich discusses</a>.</p>
