<p>Rich has shamed me a little unintentionally – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/travel/judys_book.php">he’s been a posting madman</a> up at <a href="http://www.judysbook.com">Judy’s Book</a> and has like 80 more posts than I do. I just added a handful of reviews tonight, I am determined to catch up with Rich.</p>

<p>I am threatening to pull well ahead of him on an investment that is currently in steath beta tho. A little internal competition is healthy.</p>
