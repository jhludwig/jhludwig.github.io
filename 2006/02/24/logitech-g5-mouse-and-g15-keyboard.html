<p>To match my new sli pc, i updated to gaming-optimized input devices – the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2142,CONTENTID=10715">g5 mouse</a> and <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2166,CONTENTID=10717">g15 keyboard</a>. The keyboard is cool – the little lcd display during games is very cool. I’ve seen this keyboard in action for months and finally had to get one. The mouse is also cool – the adjustable weights are awesome – i am running in the heaviest config right now but will see where i end up.</p>

<p>One huge beef tho – the lack of certified drivers. Not that I am anal about certification, it is just that install is a PITA as you have to wade thru a sea of warnings from MSFT that these drivers will make your PC break out in hives. Logitech is a big company, MSFT is a big company, why can’t they get their heads together and get this solved?</p>
