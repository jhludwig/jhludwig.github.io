<p>Nice <a href="http://brandautopsy.typepad.com/brandautopsy/2006/02/radioshacks_eve.html">post on radio shack’s increasing irrelevance to most consumers</a>. As a <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">make-magazine</a> kind of guy,i tend to only go into radio shack when i need some part or cable to interconnect things. And I always wonder why radio shack prices all the little parts i buy so low. They are certainly leaving money on the table in my transactions.</p>
