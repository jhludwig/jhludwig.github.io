<p>After <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2005/12/easing_the_netgear_sc101_out_o.html">expunging the Netgear SC101 disaster from my network</a>, I found that I had lost about 10% of my ripped CDs – notably all my Led Zep.</p>

<p>So time to rerip. After <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/movies/oggcodecs_decodes_flac.php">reviewing all of Rich’s goodness on codecs</a>, I decided it was time to go lossless. On my new <a href="http://www.widowpc.com">WidowPC rig</a>, I installed:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com">dbpoweramp</a> for ripping * the <a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com/codec-central.htm">flac codec</a> for lossless support * <a href="http://www.accuraterip.com/">accuraterip</a> to help insure correct ripping</p>

<p>So starting the process now. Will take months to complete as a background task. Glad I still have all the cds around. I rip to flac for longterm storage, and then convert to mp3 so that the ipod and other devices can deal with. Really not much more painful than ripping straight to mp3 – dbpoweramp does a pretty good job at batch conversion.</p>
