<p>Love the fact that the web has enabled so much personalized production. Things I’ve noticed recently:</p>

<p>* Visa cards with whatever photo you want on them at <a href="http://www.americafirst.com/visa/credit/picture_perfect.cfm">AmericaFirst</a> * Custom designed ice cream flavors at <a href="http://www.ecreamery.com/default.asp">eCreamery</a> * Get Logos made for your business or whatever at <a href="http://www.logoworks.com">Logoworks</a> or <a href="http://www.GotLogos.com">GotLogos</a> * Custom foam cushions of any shape, with any fabric cover, using a variety of foams, at <a href="http://www.foamorder.com/sewing.html">Foamorder.com</a>. I’ve actually used this service and it worked great.</p>
