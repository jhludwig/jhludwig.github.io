<p>Remember <a href="http://www.buckeyextra.com/?story=139632" title="BuckeyeXtra">1974</a> when the #1 Buckeyes cruised into East Lansing and laid an egg. Or <a href="http://www.spartantailgate.com/2005/10/13/buckeye-fan-sites-predict-osu-win-over-msu/">1998</a> when the Spartans came into Columbus and beat the #1 Buckeyes. You just never know what is going to happen with MSU. Scariest game left on the schedule ex Michigan of course.</p>
