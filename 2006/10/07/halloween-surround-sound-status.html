<p>Tested my surround sound setup for our front yard this AM.</p>

<p>* For authoring using <a href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/Products/ShowProduct.asp?PID=1005">Sony acid pro</a>. Works great, no complaints. You can mix an arbitrary number of sound sources, each traversing the listening space on independent arbitrary paths. * Getting XP to play an ac3 file is impressively hard. Of course I can play it back on the machine with Acid Pro, but if I want to use another machine, it is tough. <a href="http://www.digital-digest.com/dvd/downloads/showsoftware_graphedit_141.html">Graphedit</a> is super helpful for examining codec chain to see if you can play the media. <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm">Klite mega codec pack</a> is good for getting codecs and tools. * Despite all this, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/10/default.aspx">wmp</a> only plays half the ac3s I give to it. The ones that do play – wmp gives me an error saying I am missing a codec. The ones that don’t play – just silently fail. Klite to the rescue again with wmp classic which seems to play them all. * Using <a href="http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/audioadv/roadie/producthome.asp">Turtle beach audioadvantage roadie</a> for 5.1 output. Seems to work fine. Nice control panel to test surround features. I didn’t have to pay anything like the $80 MSRP for this device. * Feeding the turtlebeach output via spdif to a generic av amp – bought the cheapest open-box unit i could find at bestbuy</p>

<p>Overall it sounds good. I have a much bigger listening area than typical for a home theatre install – and the impact seems to be that the center channel is a little too dominant. I’m going to experiment with moving the sound locus to further back in the listening field. And for my big lightning strikes, I may try 5 duplicate strikes, each positioned out at one of the speakers.</p>

<p>Oh and I am going to try some codec options to get WinAMP to play 5.1 via spdif.</p>
