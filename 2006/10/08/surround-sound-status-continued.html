<p>Continuing to plug away on my halloween surround sound setup – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/10/halloween_surround_sound_statu.html" title="A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: Halloween Surround Sound Status">A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: Halloween Surround Sound Status</a> One awesomely great feature of the <a href="http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/audioadv/roadie/producthome.asp">turtlebeach audioadvantage roadie</a> is the headphone jack. You can use it simultaneously with the spdif out – so many sound cards turn off the speaker out when a headphone is detected. here you can use both. the documented use is to attach another pair of speakers to create a 7.1 setup. But for halloween you can use this extra output to drive your lightning controller such as the <a href="http://www.i-zombie.com/">i-zombie</a>.</p>

<p>So my sound is working great. my lighting controllers are all firing. now i am playing around with lights – halogen worklights, par lights, some low voltage stuff – to create the best effect.</p>

<p>Oh and i am working on my other surround sound config which won’t be lightning, but will be ambient graveyard sounds.</p>
