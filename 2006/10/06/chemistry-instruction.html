<p>As I take the <a href="http://anytime.engr.washington.edu/course/view.php?id=80">intro to MEMS</a> course at UW, I am also reviewing basic undergrad chemistry because it has been a billion years since I’ve done so. I’m using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Modern-Chemistry-David-Oxtoby/dp/0030353734/sr=8-1/qid=1160162306/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-1236528-6468167?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" title="Amazon.com: Principles of Modern Chemistry: Books: David W. Oxtoby,H. Pat Gillis">Amazon.com: Principles of Modern Chemistry: Books: David W. Oxtoby,H. Pat Gillis</a> which seems to be a fine book, but gosh do I think we teach chemistry bass-ackwords. I just don’t see the value, in 2006, of teaching first the classical bonding models and then much later reexamining from a quantum perspective. The classical models just seem brain-damaging to me. Learning things like “The formal charge on an atom in a Lewis diagram is simple to calculate…it would have a postive charge equal to its group number…from this positive charge, subtract the number of lone-pair valence electrons…and then subtract one half of the number of bonding electrons…” is just painful, it just seems like black magic alchemy when it isn’t founded on a deeper understanding of the underlying behaviour. Oh well.</p>
