<p>I raised a dispute with <a href="http://www.americanexpress.com">American Express</a> concerning my problems with <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/10/an_alienware_sucks_roundup.html">Alienware</a> and I have to thank them, it is making things happen. I finally got a personal contact from alienware today:</p>

<p>_Dear Mr. Ludwig,</p>

<p>I tried to call you earlier today and left you a voicemail on the following regard. As I stated in the message, your system is ready to be shipped out, however earlier today Alienware received a chargeback dispute from your credit card company in the amount of $XXXX.XX. Unfortunately, we cannot ship the system out until this dispute is lifted. If you can please contact your credit card company and lift this dispute, it will be most helpful in expediting your order. Please feel free to contact me at anytime should you have any questions regarding this matter.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>XXXXXXXXXX XXXXX Critical Issues Agent Alienware Corporation</p>

<p>Phone: 305.XXX.XXXX Fax: 786.XXX.XXXX www.alienware.com_</p>

<p>Needless to say I will not be lifting the dispute. It is apparently the only lever I have – the system is just coincidentally ready to ship out the moment they receive the dispute notice. They can ship me the system and if it is perfect I will pay. I’d rather the money back.</p>
