<p><a href="http://docs.google.com">Google docs and spreadsheets</a> â€“ nice to see these combined. thankfully they picked up more of the writely interface for presenting your list of available docs, it was always kind of pain to always arrive at a new blank spreadsheet in google spreadsheets, when i normally wanted to open an existing sheet. much easier now. Still desparately want charts in the spreadsheet package.</p>
