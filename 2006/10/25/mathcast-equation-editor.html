<p>Need an equation editor for my UW Course. Don’t have office installed anymore and so don’t have the free one that comes with office. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mathcast" title="SourceForge.net: MathCast Equation Editor">SourceForge.net: MathCast Equation Editor</a> seems to be the leading open source altenative – also requires <a href="http://web.mit.edu/atticus/www/mathml/mit-mathml-fonts-1.0-fc1.msi">a font package from MIT</a>. Seems a little obtuse but hey I am editing equations so I am swimming in obtuse. I guess OpenOffice has an equation editor too but I don’t want to install all that cruft.</p>

<p><a href="http://smarth.sourceforge.net/">Smarth</a> is an online alternative but doesn’t seem to function that well in Firefox. I really wish google docs would support equations but oh well.</p>
