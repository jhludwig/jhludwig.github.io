<p>I need to create a mindmap for a health issue – something where I can relate symptoms to diseases to indicators to remedies to … I thought about just doing a database app but I’d like to be able to drag stuff around on the screen easily and look at the web of connections.</p>

<p>So it looks like I could use <a href="http://www.mindmapper.com">Mindmapper</a> or <a href="http://www.MindJet.com">MindJet</a> or <a href="http://www.visual-mind.com">Visual Mind</a> or <a href="http://www.thebrain.com/">PersonalBrain</a> or a dozen others – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">wikipedia lists a kabillion choices</a>. I used Personal Brain years ago and it was ok. It would be awesome if one of these was hosted on a MySQL db so I could also query directly but it doesn’t look like that exists. Maybe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeMind">freemind</a> is the way to go, exports in a nice format useable by an external php/mysql wiki tool.</p>
