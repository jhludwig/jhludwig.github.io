<p>I exhausted myself driving around yesterday looking for connectors and other electronics parts for some halloween projects. <a href="http://www.vetco.net/">Vetco</a>, <a href="http://www.radioshack.com">radio Shack</a>, <a href="http://www.frys.com">frys</a> were all strike outs as were the local hobby stores.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lynxmotion.com/Default.aspx?SSLRedirect=true&amp;ContentCode=Home" title="Lynxmotion Robot Kits">Lynxmotion</a> is the place to go, they have all the stuff I needed. Should have started there. I wanted instant gratification but just got frustrated.</p>
