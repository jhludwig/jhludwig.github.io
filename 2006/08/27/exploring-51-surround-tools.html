<p>I’m working on creating some surround sound effects for my halloween setup this year. I’ve been looking for software to do this cheaply but no such luck so far.</p>

<p>I am starting with regular stereo flac files from various sfx discs i’ve purchased over the years. I’m using the 5.1 panning features of <a href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/Products/ShowProduct.asp?PID=1005&amp;KeyCode=7777-4701">Sony Acid Pro</a> to create a static path for the sound thru my listening space – this is pretty easy once you understand the complexities of Acid Pro. This leaves with an AcidPro-proprietary format ffile which you can play with AcidPro. For my purposes this might be good enough.</p>

<p>However it would be nice to create AC3 files that could be played on arbitrary PCs, burnt to dvd, etc. AcidPro will render AC3 files but it is another $199 for the codec pak to do this. I haven’t found much on the web for a free way to render AC3 – one thought tho is to loop back the spdif output from the pc to another soundcard and capture the incoming spdif stream – <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=338286">this post suggests how to do that</a>. But this is not going to be cheaper than just buying the codec pak.</p>

<p>I’d like to find some filter that could capture the spdif stream before it leaves the pc.</p>

<p>Another issue is playback. I am using winamp for playback (because i am playing with the <a href="http://discolitez.com/">discolitez</a> plugin) and winamp doesn’t natively support ac3 playback. <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/WinampAC3.htm">WinAmpAC3</a> looks like it may do the trick tho.</p>
