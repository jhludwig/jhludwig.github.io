<p>Met Kurt today – <a href="http://www.grimvisions.com/" title="Grimvisions.com">Grimvisions.com</a> – another Seattle Halloween enthusiast. Some great stuff up here and some stuff I should have thought of – bending PVC with a heat gun instead of just depending on finding the right fixtures. Also in person Kurt gave me another great pointer – <a href="http://spike.pnta.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Category_Code=SOC">Sculpt or Coat</a> to weatherproof props.</p>
