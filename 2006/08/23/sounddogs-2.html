<p>I’ve been working on my halloween soundtracks and I needed some new thunder sounds. I’ve been using some thunder tracks off of old sfx cds but they have a lot of ambient hiss – sometimes by design to sound like rain, sometimes just crappy recorded. When you amp up these tracks for outdoor usage, the hiss is just too much.</p>

<p>I wanted some clean thunder tracks and so went to <a href="http://www.sounddogs.com/" title="Sound Effects, Production Music, Royalty Free Music, MP3 AIF WAV Sound Effects">Sound Effects, Production Music, Royalty Free Music, MP3 AIF WAV Sound Effects</a>. Great experience – they have more choices than you can possibly imagine, and they deliver in just about any encoding form you could want. And to reward me, they sent me a free sfx after I ordered – pretty smart, the marginal cost of them doing this is basically nothing and they have made me happy. Recommended.</p>
