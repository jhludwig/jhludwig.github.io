<p>Spent time today helping a friend do this…the google site is pretty good, but doesn’t really give guidance on what to do if your pop client keeps getting rejected. google has a <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/UnlockCaptcha">anti-robot test</a> you need to complete involving a captcha. perhaps this is just for new gmail accounts.</p>
