<p>As I mentioned a couple days ago, I’d really like to flip my home phone system to an asterisk-based system, but I need a reseller because a) i don’t have time to do the deployment myself, b) i don’t want to be frontline support for my household, c) a special case of a, i have some funky analog control stuff wired into my current phone system that i need someone else to spend time figuring out how to plug into asterisk – intercoms, some mechanical actuators. It is probably not that hard but I don’t have a lot of time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enUS175US175&amp;q=asterisk reseller" title="asterisk reseller - Google Search">asterisk reseller - Google Search</a> – points me towards <a href="http://www.digium.com/en/ecosystem/resellers/">digium</a>. They in turn pointed me toward <a href="http://www.bitstruct.com/">bitstruct</a> and <a href="http://www.digitalcandle.com/asterisk">digitalcandle</a>, both of whom have been totally unresponsive – their websites don’t inspire confidence in their asterisk reselling skills either. The <a href="http://www.hometechnologies.com/index.shtml">guys that did my home theatre install</a> don’t do telephony projects, they pointed me towards someone who wanted to sell some exchange/activedirectory integrated thing, not what i am after.</p>

<p>If you know of an asterisk reseller/installer…</p>
