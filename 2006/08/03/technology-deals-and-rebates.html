<p>Rich got me excited about rebates and deals on technology – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/current_canon_rebates.php" title="Tong Family Blog: Current Canon Rebates">Tong Family Blog: Current Canon Rebates</a> – great deals on Canon cameras. I did a quick search because i need a new printer for HP Rebates and wow there are a lot of offers out there – <a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/rebateGateway.html">HP Rebate Gateway</a> , <a href="http://www.hp.com/sbso/special/hotdeals.html">HP Hot Deals</a>, <a href="http://www.hpwebdeals.com/?s=100&amp;k=801">HP Web Deals</a> (Is this an official HP site?). Oh I might need a new TIVO too and so I found the <a href="http://www.tivorebates.com/promocenter/tivo/track.html">Tivo Rebate center</a>. I suspect if I cataloged all the hardware and software on my home network and methodically looked for logical deals and upgrade offers, I would find a lot of great offers. And then there are all the local retailer deals. It is inconvenient to sort thru all this, I really need an automagic way to harvest all the deals I am likely to be interested in.</p>
