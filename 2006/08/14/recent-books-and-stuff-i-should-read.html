<p>* “Beyond Oil”:amazon by Deffeyes. Excellent, breezy book looking at the production and supply issues behind oil and all other energy sources, by a very smart scientist. An essential read if you care about energy policy. It is difficult not to be an advocate of nuclear power after reading this. * “Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World”:amazon by Weatherford. A reasonably engaging history of genghis khan and the mongol empire. Sadly neglected in the history I was taught. One wonders how the world might have turned if just a few events had gone differently – the spread of the plague, the japanese invasion, the indonesian invasion. * “The Ruins”:amazon by Scott Smith. Stephen king-esque. A little slow to start but finishes with a bang. Tho I never really cared about the characters.</p>
