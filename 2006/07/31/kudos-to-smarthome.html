<p>I ordered some outdoor flicker lamps from <a href="http://www.smarthome.com/" title="SMARTHOME - X10, Remote Control, Home Automation, Wireless Security, Lighting Control">SMARTHOME - X10, Remote Control, Home Automation, Wireless Security, Lighting Control</a> and some of them were defective. In a cranky mood I filled out their post-sales survey, and was contacted promptly by them and they are sending me a new unit. It pays to complain I guess.</p>
