  <li><a href="http://www.processlibrary.com/quickaccess/">Process Library taskmanager plugin</a>. Just OK. does make it marginally easier to get process info but i had hoped it would pull info right into taskmanager instead of just a generic link icon. and processlibrary hides so much of its info behind a subscription wall. Still I appreciate the effort.</li>
