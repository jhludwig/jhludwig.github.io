<p><a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/photography/noise_ninja_neat_image_and_dxo.php">Rich reminded me</a> of <a href="http://dxo.com/en/photo/home/default.php">dxo</a> and pointed me towards <a href="http://www.picturecode.com/">noise ninja</a> and neatimage. Dxo is cool tho I donâ€™t know that I really appreciate the coolness of it. NoiseNinja does more for me because I have really noticed the noise in some of my pictures. They all seem to work great.</p>
