<p>Eric recommend “Fantastic Voyage : Live Long Enough to Live Forever”:amazon by Kurweil and Grossman. Interesting read. The high level recos make a lot of sense and are not particularly new – eliminate sugars and processed carbs from the diet, exercise, etc. And these guys give good science behind these recos.</p>

<p>The crazy stuff is the extreme supplement plan – one of the authors takes 250 oral supplements daily and also has direct transfusions weekly. I am unconvinced of the science behind this – I am not convinced that flooding the body with a bunch of chemical constituents of intermediate reactions is a good thing, nor that we understand the impact on the entire sustem. But still interesting and a worthy read.</p>
