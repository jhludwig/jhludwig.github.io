<p>Need to equip a car with a mini kitchen â€“ looking for travel appliances. <a href="http://www.compactappliance.com/xq/JSP.jump/itemType.CATEGORY/itemID.567/qx/12_Volt___Travel_Coolers.htm">Compact Appliance</a> seems to have a ton of travel coolers but not so many microwaves. Microwaves at <a href="http://roadtruckerhttp://www.roadtrucker.com/12-volt-kitchen-3.htm">roadtrucker</a>. I wonder how these work overnight when the car is off?</p>
