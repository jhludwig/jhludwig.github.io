<p>Haven’t had much opportunity to travel in the last year but hopefully will get the chance to do so. In the meantime there are some trips I am dying to take and I might as well collect all the links so I can quickly organize when I get the chance.</p>

<p>I’ve been dying to go to Chile for many years now. The natural beauty really calls to me. The highlight of my trip will be an <a href="http://www.earthriver.com/expeditions.asp?expedition=futaleufu&amp;ss=3&amp;header=3">Earth River expedition in Patagonia</a>. This pretty much pins the trip to the Chilean summer months – December thru March.</p>

<p>Certainly I’ll want to spend time before or after the river in and around Santiago – some online guides:</p>

<p>And then probably will want to get out of Santiago and see one other part of the country…not sure where…maybe should stay in Lake District a while at end of rafting trip tho maybe I’d be all watered out at that point? Or maybe Valparaiso and Vina del Mar in central Chile – <a href="http://gosouthamerica.about.com/cs/southamerica/a/ChiDrmTripCntr.htm">here is one guy’s idea of an itinerary</a>. Easter Island would be a fascinating choice too but that just doesn’t feel to me like really getting to know Chile. Maybe the wine district – stay at <a href="http://www.jahuel.cl/">Termas Jahuel</a>.</p>
