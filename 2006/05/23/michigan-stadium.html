<p>From <a href="http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/?p=2078">Every Day Should Be Saturday</a>: <em>“The renovation seeks to add 83 indoor suites and 3,200 outdoor club seats, although overall capacity will only increase by about 750. There must be one hell of a market to watching punters develop in Ann Arbor.”</em></p>
