<p>In case you need help getting in the mood, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espntv/espnNetwork?networkID=18" title="ESPNtv.com - ESPN Classic">ESPNtv.com - ESPN Classic</a> is showing past games daily, as well as one hour summaries of key games. I saw parts of the â€˜69 loss again, damn we should have won that. And parts of the 74 12-10 OSU win.</p>
