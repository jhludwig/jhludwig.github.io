<p>Per <a href="http://www.komotv.com/about/schedule" title="KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington - Program Schedule">KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington - Program Schedule</a>, The Game is not in HD in Seattle. Even tho the Cal/USC game later in the day is. ?? Is this a Seattle problem only, is The Game on in HD anywhere?</p>

<p>UPDATE: got an email response from KOMO, it will be on in HD, their website just isnâ€™t correct. Whew.</p>
