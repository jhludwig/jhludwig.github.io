<p>I don’t think there is any Wolverine I hate more than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Biakabutuka" title="Tim Biakabutuka - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Tim Biakabutuka</a> – he made OSU look silly in ‘95. A classic game of the Cooper years, OSU came in undefeated and threw up. I still feel the pain.</p>
