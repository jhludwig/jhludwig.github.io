<p>Less than 6 days to the game of the millenium. I kind of prefer the <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball">Sporstline countdown time</a>r over the <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/" title="The Columbus Dispatch">The Columbus Dispatch</a> countdown timer. And they differ by an hour?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, neither of the Detroit papers have a countdown timer, they just arenâ€™t serious about the game, which is a strike against them.</p>
