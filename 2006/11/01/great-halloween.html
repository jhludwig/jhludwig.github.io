<p>Total successes – our talking tree, the FCG, the Creature Crate. Also our surround sound systems generated a lot of volume, and the sounds i got from Sounddogs were really clean.</p>

<p>Failures – my pneuma-powered popping ghost. My “waterproof” container for the control electronics somehow got an inch of water in it. Ffffft.</p>

<p>Almost failure – the Creature Crate controller also struggled with dampness, continually shorting out. I had to apply a blower and some heatlamps to get it going.</p>

<p>Lesson for next year…all the control electronics that I placed in the garage or in the house worked perfectly. All the electronics outside struggled with dampness one way or another. I either need to</p>

<p>* house all the electronics indoors and just run power or pneuma cables outdoors. works fine for power, that is how i did my thunder &amp; lightning. not going to work great with pneuma… * make the electronics easily pluggable so i can bring them in at night and take them out in the afternoon. might be the best strategy, but kind of a pain * invest a lot in weather proofing the outside containers.</p>

<p>Crowds started out slow last night but at about 7pm traffic exploded. Last visitor at 945 and then we shut down.</p>

<p>Massive cleanup ahead…</p>
