<p>We’re adding a household employee and I need to find a service/software to manage payroll – cut checks, handle all the tax filings, year end 1040s, etc etc etc. At first glance here is what I am finding:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.paycycle.com/">Paycycle</a> gets a good review in <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1962506,00.asp">PCMag</a> and is paying to be at the top of google listings</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.surepayroll.com/">Surepayroll</a> gets a decent review as well but seems to cost a lot more.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sbs.adp.com/?source=PPC-GO">ADP</a> has a small business offer but I suspect overkill. Ditto <a href="http://www.peachtree.com/gateway/pps/integration.cfm?gcid=S17597x001-smb_integ&amp;keyword=small%20business%20payroll">Peachtree</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.buyerzone.com/personnel/payroll/qz_questions_265.jhtml">Buyerzone</a> seems to have a lead gen system that will generate quite a few quotes from outsourcing services. Hesitate to try, I don’t want a blizzard of annoying email. And there is <a href="http://www.supplier-match.com/content_index.jsp?c=Payroll&amp;su=service%20providers&amp;id=1083957938281003027&amp;partner=personnel/payroll/qz_questions_265.jhtml">supplier-match</a>, they are an affiliate of buyerzone, so I guess I pay two fees effectively to get a referal? crazy.</li>
  <li>I am sure the <a href="http://www.payroll.com/">quickbooks solution</a> is adequate but I don’t really want to install software.</li>
  <li>I am not sure how <a href="http://www.10dollarpayroll.com/">10dollarpayroll</a> differs from paycycle but anyone who uses the blink tag (or the moral equivalent) in 2006 is off my list.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.payrollpayroll.com/index-ppc.html">Payrollpayroll</a> – I guess they really really know know their their payroll payroll stuff stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am sure my accountant can recommend some local service providers too. Has anyone used paycycle?</p>
