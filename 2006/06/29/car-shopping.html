<p>Looking at some cars to add to the household – the sweet spot is the $32K sedan.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.volvocars.us/models/s60/" title="Volvo S60">Volvo S60</a>, <a href="http://www.subaru.com/shop/model_consideration.jsp?model=LEGACY">Subaru Legacy</a>, and <a href="http://www.vw.com/passat/index.html">vw passat</a> all seem like great choices. Good interior styling, good safety, good handling and performance. And all seem like good values, you get a lot for your dollar.</p>

<p>We wanted to like the <a href="http://www.toyota.com/avalon/index.html">Toyota Avalon</a> but the handling just wasn’t there – this thing wallows thru the turns. Styling and features are decent but not handling. We wanted to like the <a href="http://www.chrysler.com/300/">Chrysler 300</a> also and it handles nicely, has a great powertrain, and looks good on the outside, but the interior styling and fit-and-finish are 10 years behind.</p>

<p>And the <a href="http://www.cadillac.com/cadillacjsp/model/gallery.jsp?model=cts">Cadillac CTS</a> – what an embarrassment. A salesperson who hasn’t heard yet that Cadillac no longer is the pacesetter; overpriced, and underfeatured. I would feel stupid buying this car.</p>
