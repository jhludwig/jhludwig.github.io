And as I sit here dreaming about being able to use Google Spreadsheet, that is the one function I want.”</p>

<p>Me too. I use half a dozen machines regularly, i use kiosk machines, I want all my docs everywhere. And I don’t need all the features of high-end office apps. Writely is fine for me, I am sure an online spreadsheet will be good enough too. And I am so tired of installing software on machines.</p>
