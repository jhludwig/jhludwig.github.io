<p>I get a lot of visitors looking for info on the best college stadiums. Well here are some pointers to web resources:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.hhweb.com/stadiumphotos_college.htm" title="College Stadiums Football Photos 8x10">College Stadiums Football Photos 8x10</a> – nice aerial and in-stadium photos for a lot of the top stadiums. Great gift for fans. * <a href="http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/Internet/attendance/ia_attendance.html">NCAA attendance stats for 2005</a> – a loud full stadium is a good stadium * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892048050/102-3127790-0050535?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Saturday Shrines</a> on Amazon. * <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/big12/003365.php">Fanblogs points to</a> Dennis Dodd’s 2003 rankings which I think are crap. <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005536.php">Fanblogs also points to the Rivals 05 rankings</a> which I like better. * <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/">Sporting News/MSNBC rankings</a> here which I also wonder about. * <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCL/is_4_32/ai_94123522">Football Digest rankings</a> – I can get behind these!</p>

<p>My view is – any full loud stadium on a Saturday afternoon or evening is a great place to be. I haven’t been to that many, but my views on a few:</p>

<p>* Ohio Stadium – great crowd, great band, great pageantry, great architecture. A+. What did you think I’d say? * Michigan Stadium – great crowd, but kind of characterless architecture. B+ * ASU in Tempe. What a great setting. Too bad the team isn’t consistently better. B+ * UW. Another great setting, but a team that is a snoozer. Still where else can you moor your boat for a tailgate picnic? B * Rose Bowl. Great potential but too many empty seats – not being on campus hurts. B- * Pitt Stadium. Great location, right in the thick of things. Great crowds, inconsistent team. B</p>
