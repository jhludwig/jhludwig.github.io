<p>My close-in park of choice for quick hikes is Cougar Mountain, but <a href="http://www5.metrokc.gov/reports/parkinfo/getParkInfo.asp?PID=2726,Soaring%20Eagle%20Regional%20Park" title="King County Parks and Facilities Information">Soaring Eagle</a> looks like an interesting choice too. Thanks to <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2006/06/hiking.html">Steve</a> for the tip. And thanks also to King County for their <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/parks/trails/">killer online trail maps and info</a></p>
