I’d say just an average science book. It didn’t really help me understand quantum computing components or algorithms that much. And also spent too much time on explaining classical computer terminology (explaining a NAND gate and its role as a universal constructor, explaining a Turing machine, explaining NP complete, explaining public key crypto, etc). In the author’s defense I’d guess this is a very hard book to write, I don’t think it is easy to explain quantum effects to those not deeply versed in the subject.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/06/24/economist-article-on-us-auto-industry.html">Economist Article on US Auto Industry</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>A great article in the print <a href="http://www.economist.com">Economist</a> 6/14 issue about the US auto industry and its impending demise. The article is behind the fee firewall, but some pithy highlights: The GM pension fund is underfunded by $19B, which is equal to the market cap of GM. GM has 2.5 pensioners for every active employee – and downsizing only makes the situation worse. They face declining domestic share. It just doesn’t look like there is a way for them to survive this. Ford is in little better shape. They both seem like bankruptcy candidates soon, which means the pensioners will get screwed. I hope the government doesn’t step in and try to save to corporate entities, I’d rather see our tax dollars go to protecting the pensioned workers and towards retraining the current workers, rather than protecting the corporate entities.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/06/19/mounting-ext2fs-volumes-under-windows.html">Mounting Ext2FS volumes under Windows</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>My cheapo <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000572.html">connectstor NAS box</a> died recently. Just started whirring and whirring, unresponsive to any remote CIFS or HTTP request. I tore it apart and mounted one of the raided 120G drives in a USB2.0 drive enclosure and started looking at it directly from my desktop machine.</p>

<p>First I tried <a href="http://www.powerquest.com/partitionmagic/">PartitionMagic</a> on it. Good news – the volume was recognizable. So-so news – it was an ext2 format volume, the connectstor box runs linux of course. PartitionMagic couldn’t seem to do much with ext2 volumes, I wanted to get the data off the disk.</p>

<p>Google suggests <a href="http://www.ext2fs.com/">Paragon Software’s Ext2FS</a> driver for windows. For $30 seemed worth trying, but their ecommerce site, hosted in europe somewhere, couldn’t seem to take my MasterCard. probably some little trivial problem but I didn’t have the patience to figure out.</p>

<p>Next I tried <a href="http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/explore2fs.htm" title="Explore2fs HomePage">Explore2fs</a>. Very nice windows utility, and I could see all my files, hurray! But trying to copy them out to my windows desktop hung the app. Some of the files made it but not all.</p>

<p>Next I found the <a href="http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/ext2.html">Ext2fs</a> project on sourceforge. A real live ext2 fsd for windows. Easily installed but pretty cryptic mount instructions. I had to know the disk id and volume id i was trying to mount, and i had a little trouble discovering them. But back to Explore2fs, it told me the disk and volume id, and then i could mount using Ext2Fs.</p>

<p>I am now happily copying all the files over.</p>

    <p>At ignition this week, what is even worse than spam, is the flood of NDRs we are getting. Because some spammer has chosen to use a forged return address of bogusname@ignitioncorp.com, and is sending tons of spam to randomly created email addresses. we are thus getting a flood of NDRs.</p>

<p>it is ridiculous that the mail protocols that we use for our line of business permit this sort of chicanery.</p>
