				<p><p>A great opening to the season for the Buckeyes – <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=232420194" title="ESPN.com - NCF - Boxscore - Washington at Ohio State - 08/30/2003">ESPN.com - NCF - Boxscore - Washington at Ohio State - 08/30/2003</a>.</p>

<p>On offense, Krenzel had a typical Krenzel game – great leadership, good field vision, good movement, great contribution on the ground. But he missed receivers a lot, he got a lot of opportunities in this game, but he wasn’t sharp delivering the ball. The receiver corp seems broad and deep (Childress made some nice catches), if Krenzel was a little sharper the score would have been much more impressive. The rushing game was fine tho not explosive. Hall and Ross looked better as the game went on – thanks to fresh legs from their rotation, and a dominating offensive line. The drive in the middle of the third quarter was just outstanding – OSU at its best – a patient mix of short passes and runs, nothing tricky, but it just wore UW out.</p>

<p>The defense was stifling. Big hits. Pickett was on his back many times, the UW receivers couldn’t get near the ball without getting crushed – Salley just about took himself out of the game with a crushing hit in the 3rd. And when they had to – after a fumble – the defense really poured it on – WIll Smith delivered a stiflign sack in the 4th to end the last meaningful UW threat. The line and linebacker corp seem awesome – the best quote of the game was about LB Simon Fraser, about whom the announcer said “he is so big, they named a university in Canada after him.”</p>

<p>Special teams were good. Sanders seems like a fine punter, nicely replacing Scott Grooms from last year. A field goal block. One unfortunate fumble trying to do too much on a return – the elimination of the halo rule this year really does have an impact, we are going to see a lot more turnovers on punts.</p>

<p>Coaching seemed quietly good. The game plan didn’t give away much, Tressell realizes that there is no point showing off your whole arsenal if you don’t need to. The team was clearly ready for the game, tho they seemed to play at 3/4 speed at times – for this game, that was fine, but it won’t work in the Big 10. The team has time to step it up.</p>

<p>For UW, well this was a tough game to open up a new coaching tenure. The Huskies still lack any kind of running threat. Pickett’s Heisman dreams certainly weren’t helped, he will have to step it up against future opponents. I hope Gilbertson is better than he looks – he looked overmatched, confused, and out of shape out there.</p>

<p>Finally, the broadcast booth. Keith Jackson? First he retired and got a big sendoff. Then he came back, but just for west coast games. Ohio Stadium is a loooong way from the west coast. I like the guy well enough, but I want back that retirement gift I sent him. :)</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">29 August 2003</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Letter from <a href="http://ohiostatebuckeyes.ocsn.com/" title="OhioStateBuckeyes.com : The Official Web Site of Ohio State Athletics">OhioState AD Andy Geiger</a> received today, probably sent to the entire alumni association:</p>

<p>Dear Ohio State Football Fan,</p>

<p>Will any of us ever forget the thrills of the 2002 Football Season and the Buckeyes’ triumphant journey to the Fiesta Bowl and the National Championship? An unprecedented fourteen victories. Thrillingly close games. Individual and collective heroics that carried Ohio State to the very top of college football. Most of all, I treasure the sportsmanship, teamwork, and integrity our team demonstrated along the path to success.</p>

<p>Regrettably, other aspects of last season won’t soon be forgotten either. All season, we witnessed and received letters, email, and phone calls telling us of the vulgarity, rudeness, poor sportsmanship – even vandalism – exhibited by some Ohio State “fans.” These people chose a most unfortunate way of “supporting” our team – with a lack of respect for our opponents, for fellow Buckeye fans, and for themselves. They spoiled the day for many.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we live in a time when the put-down, trash-talking and humiliation have become part of the entertainment and sports culture. This is not the Ohio State way. Not now, not in the past, and certainly not in the future.</p>

<p>Our student-athletes are expected to be role models as representatives of The Ohio State University and I support this notion. However, I believe <em>everyone</em> associated with the University has the same responsibility to make a positive presentation to this community, and to our visitors, any time we host an event.</p>

<p>This season, I am asking for your help. Please let us know of any incidents you witness – or any indignities you suffer personally – either at Ohio Stadium or at an away game. Help us identify those who inflect their poor behaviour on others. Our Department of Athletics has adopted six fundamental values that our coaches, student-athletes, and support staff strive to live by. They are: Education, Integrity, Excellence, Innovation, Respect for the Individual, Leadership.</p>

<p>I urge you, as a member of the Ohio State community, to embrace these core values. You will contribute to making The Ohio State University the very best in everything we do. And, you will help us make our events friendly, wholesome and welcoming for our opponents, their fans, and of course our own Buckeye family.</p>

<p>Cheer heartily for our Buckeyes. Rejoice in the essence of intercollegiate athletics, which allows us to send our sons and daughters into competition with their sons and daughters. But, remember that the great rivalries we enjoy in the Big Ten are built upon a tradition of trust and cooperation. This, tos is worthy of celebration!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Andy Geiger<br />
Director of Athletics</p>

<p><strong>My take:</strong> It is great that the University sent this out. It is a fine first step, and the fact that it did not come bundled with an appeal for money gives it more weight. I hope the University sends this message out 4-5 more times during the season, repetition will help.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we live in a time when the put-down, trash-talking and humiliation have become part of the entertainment and sports culture. This is not the Ohio State way. Not now, not in the past, and certainly not in the future.</p>

<p>Our student-athletes are expected to be role models as representatives of The Ohio State University and I support this notion. However, I believe <em>everyone</em> associated with the University has the same responsibility to make a positive presentation to this community, and to our visitors, any time we host an event.</p>

<p>This season, I am asking for your help. Please let us know of any incidents you witness – or any indignities you suffer personally – either at Ohio Stadium or at an away game. Help us identify those who inflect their poor behaviour on others. Our Department of Athletics has adopted six fundamental values that our coaches, student-athletes, and support staff strive to live by. They are: Education, Integrity, Excellence, Innovation, Respect for the Individual, Leadership.</p>

<p>I urge you, as a member of the Ohio State community, to embrace these core values. You will contribute to making The Ohio State University the very best in everything we do. And, you will help us make our events friendly, wholesome and welcoming for our opponents, their fans, and of course our own Buckeye family.</p>

<p>Cheer heartily for our Buckeyes. Rejoice in the essence of intercollegiate athletics, which allows us to send our sons and daughters into competition with their sons and daughters. But, remember that the great rivalries we enjoy in the Big Ten are built upon a tradition of trust and cooperation. This, tos is worthy of celebration!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Andy Geiger<br />
Director of Athletics</p>

<p><strong>My take:</strong> It is great that the University sent this out. It is a fine first step, and the fact that it did not come bundled with an appeal for money gives it more weight. I hope the University sends this message out 4-5 more times during the season, repetition will help.</p>

Colour me dubious. I had a p2t phone for years and after a burst of initial activity i quit using it, it just wasn’t that much more convenient than a regular phone call. And I’m on my third camera phone and i hardly ever use the camera. The pictures suck and it is too hard to do anything useful with them. Sure, the pictures will get better, but so will those of my regular digital camera, there will still be a gap. and it will get easier to send and blog the pictures. but geez, i just wish the phone was better at being a phone. better at syncing my address book with my desktop. not dropping so many damn calls. better coverage. easier call history use. all these other non-phone features are just clutter.</p>

And the fact that the student body is the <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/rankings.asp?listing=1022748&amp;LTID=1">2nd happiest</a> student body in the country makes us feel good. Good luck L.</p>

<p>Update: some quick feedback on the Pomona IT and telecom resources. Not much WIFI on campus – a few access points but it is not pervasive in the dorms, that’s too bad. Of course they do have 10Mbit links to all the dorm rooms – I wonder when they will switch to 100mbit? On the telecom side, the school recommends T-Mobile but I am underwhelmed with the coverage. Word on the street is that Verizon may be the way to go.</p>
