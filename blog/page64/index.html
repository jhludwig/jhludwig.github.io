  <h1><a href="/2007/05/04/recent-books-mostly-modern-fiction.html">Recent Books -- mostly modern fiction</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “Spindrift”:amazon by Allen Steele. First contact novel. Fine effort. Not particularly innovative but entertaining. The guy has won a bunch of SF awards so perhaps I should try some of his other work * “Beyond Black”:amazon by Hilary Mantel. I’m not sure why I sti\uck with this. Tale of a medium in touch with the spirits of people from her troubled early life, and her own sorting out of that history. The characters are not particularly attractive. Something about the process of digging through troubling events of your childhood with eyewitnesses was appealing tho. * “Red Cat”:amazon by Peter Spiegelman. One in a series of mysteries featuring PI John March. A great character and a great story of deeply flawed relatives and families. Worthy of the accolades it has received. * “The Futurist”:amazon by Othmar. An entertaining farce. Witty. Probably won’t age well so read it now (I don’t think Catch-22 has aged well for instance). * “The Traveller”:amazon by John Twelve Hawks. A novel in the illuminati genre, opens with great scenes and good characters. But sadly doesn’t develop much after that. The characters gain no emotional or moral depth and the plot is pedestrian. The author sets up a lot of storylines for subsequent books at the cost of this individual tale. If I’m at an airport and novel 2 is on the shelf I’ll buy it, but I’m not driven to find out what happens to these characters. * “The Bowl Is Already Broken”:amazon by Mary Kay Zuravleff. I gave this 70 pages and then folded. The writing was just ok, but the characters were boring – lots of quirky elements but not emotionally engaging. The story seemed to be diving deeper and deeper into the petty politics of the museum world but seeming less and less relevant to any other walk of life.</p>

<p>And one non-fiction:</p>

<p>* “How Doctors Think”:amazon by Jerome Groopman. Ok I didn’t really like this book. Some insight into doctor’s minds. But a lot of very articulate whining about how tough their lives are and how patients have to be more empathetic. Boo hoo hoo. The lives of sick patients are tough too. And most of the discussion is about really smart committed docs and how they struggle. In my experience docs exhibit a range of IQ and commitment and many of them exhibit less thoughtful behaviour. He does talk about some of the economic influences affecting doctors but he largely gives the profession a pass on this. I think there is a more painfully truthful story to tell.</p>

When I buy physical disks at SmugMug, those are sunk costs. They’ll never get cheaper because I’ve already paid for them.

Didn’t really understand the chemistry of water softening until I poked around a little tonight – <a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/question99.htm">how does a water softener work</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_softener">wikipedia topic</a> – apparently water softeners replace the Ca and Mg ions with Na which is less damaging to pipes, etc. But it still makes the water feel slippery. I’d like something that removes the Ca and Mg and leaves nothing behind. A lot of systems claim to do this, some below:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.lifesourcewater.com/physical_conditioning.html" title="Water Softener - Water Filter - Water Softners">Water Softener - Water Filter - Water Softners</a> * <a href="http://www.advancedwaterfilters.com/">Advanced Water Filters</a> * <a href="http://clearwatergmx.com/">GMX</a> -- this looks way too low capacity * The <a href="http://www.aquaferwater.com/AWS12.html">Aquafer</a> * The <a href="http://www.scaleblaster.com/">ScaleBlaster</a>. Also probably too low capacity but I love the name.</p>

<p>I wonder if any of these work. And are cost effective.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2007/04/09/advice-for-college-admissions-counselors.html">Advice for College Admissions Counselors</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Please please please – pretend you are a student and go out and attend a week’s worth of college visits at other institutions. I think you will find that there is a lot of mind numbing repetition across the presentations and tours. You all have study abroad programs, intern programs, food service, blue light security on campus, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>What is far more interesting to hear about is the unique aspects of your institution and the community you are in. And maybe a direct compare/contrast between your institution and your most direct “competitors”. And consider doing something different in your presentation than every other college; one school brought in a professor to talk with the kids, this was memorable; another school gave away ice cream sandwiches at the end of the tour, a simple gesture but the kids loved it.</p>

<p>I’d consider running two different info sessions and tours – one for first time college visitors, and one for people who have seen 2 or more schools already.</p>

<p>I guess what I’m saying is think a little more deeply about your audience and what they are going thru, and tune the presentation to them.</p>

    <p>* “Sunstroke”:amazon by Jesse Kellerman. Great story of a woman searching in northern Mexico for the truth about her missing boss. Great protagonist. Great supporting cast – I love the stonecutter. Very atmospheric. * “A Wicked Snow”:amazon by Gregg Olsen. Really choppy. Not a terrible story but uncomfortable to read. Where was the editor? Great cover blurb by lee child but I can’t fully recommend. * “Mission Flats”:amazon by William Landay. Police mystery set in Boston and Maine. A smalltime Maine chief of police gets involved over his head in a Boston murder conspiracy. Nice twisted ending tho I did anticipate it a little. * “Without Fail”:amazon by Lee Child. Reacher seems a little more fallible in this tale. Misses obvious clues early and often. And the bad guys show up way too late in the book, bad form for a mystery. So not the best reacher but still entertaining. * “Blue Light”:amazon by Walter Mosley. Twisty tale of alien consciousness, drugs, psychosis. Hard to tell what really happened and what was imagined. I found myself liking the characters more than I expected. * “Killing Floot”:amazon by Lee Child. Another slam bang jack reacher tale. Reacher rips the covers off a southern town conspiracy leaving a wake of bodies behind. Don’t screw with reacher. This series continues to be the best airplane books. * “From Fatigued to Fantastic!”:amazon by Teitelbaum. Good overview of chronic fatigue and potential causes and treatments. Not a cookbook, more of a collection of all the ideas around fatigue.</p>
