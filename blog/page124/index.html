    <p>…I’d focus on the academic market. I have two family members heading to college this fall, and they both need laptops with wifi for their campuses. If this is becoming the default at every major college campus, then we are seeding the market with a huge number of capable machines, a huge number of free hotspots, a user base that is very willing to try new services. What great services could we build to target these users and to help them?</p>

    <p>I see that <a href="http://www.raelity.org/archives/computers/internet/weblogs/blosxom/blosxom_2_0.html" title="raelity bytes">Blosxom 2.0</a> has shipped. Claims to have better IIS support than past versions. I wish I had time to try it again because the core design principle – leverage the file system hierarchy as your category hierarchy – is so appealing to me, no new storage system created. As a result, backup, copying, storage management, etc are so much easier. But I just don’t have the time to reimplement the blog again right now. I did play around with previous versions a lot but they were so hard to get working on IIS and NT.</p>

    <p>This month’s buildup from <a href="http://www.go-bucks.com/" title="The-Ozone">The-Ozone</a>:<em>It won’t be too much longer before the OSU football team hits the practice field in preparation for the 2003 football campaign. The team reports for fall camp on August 5, and practices begin on August 6. That schedule represents somewhat of a departure from past years. Freshmen used to report three days before the upper classmen, but this year, freshmen will not report early. There will be other changes in fall camp this season as well, many of them mandated by the NCAA. As mandated by the NCAA, the team will practice in helmets and shorts the first two days (Aug. 6-7) and helmets, then in shoulder pads the next two days (Aug. 8-9). The first day of contact is Sunday, Aug. 10. On Monday, Aug. 11, the team will begin a 2-1, 2-1, 2-1 regimen, meaning two practices on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and single sessions on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The same schedule will be in effect the week of Aug. 18. The second practice on Monday, Wednesday and Friday will be open to the media and to the public.</em></p>

The computer should do its job virtually noise-free and, above all, be based on a thermal concept. Operational convenience and ergonomics are a must, as are quality appearance and aesthetics.

<p>Update – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/001014.html">Rich</a> has had some trouble with his Shuttles but also loves the form factor. But the heat is a remaining problem – I have a room with 5 PCs running in it and the heat is terrible. I would go to a mobile CPU or maybe even blades if I could, I have to get rid of the waste heat problem.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/07/22/need-a-word.html">Need a Word.</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK in my previous post I used the word “typewritten”, meaning an 8-1/2 by 11 document, doublespaced, courier or times font, right justified, produced by pc and word processor. Of course it is not really typewritten – it has none of the signature artifacts of a typewriter – strikeout, whiteout, mishits. It could have been fully justified, creation of which is painful and clumsy on a typewritter. So i need a word to take the place of “typewritten”. “Laserwritten”, “laserjetted”, “inkjetted”? All are tradenames, all imply a certain technology which may or may not be in use. “Pc-generated”? This has none of the style of “typewritten”.</p>

    <p>At Cannon Beach for the last 5-6 days – stayed at the <a href="http://www.theoceanlodge.com/main.html" title="Main Page at the Ocean Lodge">Ocean Lodge</a>. Beautiful new lodge, good service, tho some oddities – stained typewritten hotel guide; a cardboard sign out front naming the hotel; AC in only some of the rooms; very stilted praise of one of the owning partners in the hotel guide. I just got the sense that something odd was going on behind the scenes, there were just enough little details that were askew. Maybe the owning partners are at odds? We’d stay there again, tho the Stephanie Inn right next door is nicer and has none of the odd signs. Weather was great. And of course the beach was the beach, best beach in the Pacific Northwest? Sadly I broke my toe last day of the stay and am now hobbling.</p>
