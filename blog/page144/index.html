				<p><p>Latest <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/fanblogs_xiv/005643.php">fanblog poll up</a>:</p>

<p>1. Southern California (11) 167 2. Texas (1) 155 3. Ohio St. 126 4. Tennessee 108 5. LSU 97 6. Michigan 96 7. Virginia Tech 95 8. Iowa 83 9. Georgia 82 10. Florida 53 11. Florida St. 52 12. Louisville 46 13. Arizona St. 19 14. Notre Dame 18</p>

<p>OK I am biased but I think this poll is a lot more valid than the Coaches’ or Writers’ polls. The Fanblogs folks (me included) actually see a lot of these games, certainly we see way more than the Coaches do.</p>

				<p><p>OK so this wasn’t much of an opponent for the Buckeyes. The game had the feel of a scrimmage, OSU seemed to be running at 90% speed.</p>

<p>OSU is going to need 3 or 4 balls in play to get all the talent involved on the offensive. A plethora of skill position players – 2 QBs, Ginn, several emerging tailbacks, a good receiving corps – gosh this team could be the most explosive offensive team in the Tressel era if they can get it all together.</p>

<p>And the first string defense did a nice job shutting down Miami but not sure how much of a test this was. The Miami QB was very rattled early.</p>

<p>Huston did a nice job replacing Nugent. Hit on every opportunity.</p>

<p>I have to rant a little about ABC/ESPN/DirecTV. Halfway thru the 3rd, ABC cuts away to the Oklahoma game. OK I kind of get it, the OSU game was over, and the Oklahoma game was a huge upset. But I am paying DirecTV for the College Gameplan package so I can see every freaking game, and did they unblock the OSU game? No, they did not.</p>

<p>And just to top it off, with 5 minutes to go in the Oklahoma game, the local affiliate switches to the start of the UW/Air Force game! Grrr….</p>

				<p><p>From the WSJ and other press, discussion of the <a href="http://www.mcall.com/business/local/all-mosaicaug31,0,4278363.story?coll=all-businesslocal-hed">mosaic feature</a> coming to our TV screens – watch 8 football games at once.</p>

<p>I think this is just brilliant. Football fans will pay for this. And further keeps the DSL guys at bay – they can’t even deliver one video stream, let alone 8 simultaneous games.</p>

<p>There is so much discussion about hollywood content, drm, iptv, etc – we seem to forget that live sports may be a much more important driver of video in the home. Certainly in my household our video provider selections are driven by sports programming issues – college game packages, hdtv availability, etc.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/07/one_mans_respon.html">Responding to the negative energy balance FUD around biodiesel</a> – good stuff * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/seattle_leading.html">Seattle leading way to embrace Kyoto</a> – great news. I think we’re way behind in fully embracing eco-friendly industrial policies in this country. Put it this way – if you want to defend your economy and markets from high growth, emerging producers – raising the eco-bar way high is probably a good thing to do. Emerging producers may be able to produce basic high volume goods cheaply, but it will take them a while to catch up with highly-engineered green goods and services. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/chemical_proces.html">Martin discovers process modelling software</a> – I have no real use for these tools but they are incredibly fun to play with. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/some_fun_with_o.html">Current supply and demand numbers</a> – fuel prices are only going one way. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/from_bits_to_ba.html">From Bits to Barrels</a> – Martin’s contribution to SNS, journaling his transformation into the John D.

				<p><p>I’m doing some research on automotive engineering education for high school and undergrad students. Wonder if anyone has any tips. The things I’ve found so far:</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://students.sae.org/">SAE student site</a> is a fine place to look for information. Competitions, awards, internships – more college student focused. This <a href="http://www.sae.org/news/releases/05smfinal.htm">supermileage contes</a>t looks fun. I wonder if there is an opportunity to create some biodiesel version of this project. * The <a href="http://students.sae.org/chapters/choosecollege.htm">SAE website for college selection</a> has some good tips about programs. * <a href="http://www.kettering.edu/">Kettering University</a> -- formerly GMI – a highly regarded school, but Flint is tough duty. OK I haven’t been to Flint in 17 years, maybe it has improved. * Of course <a href="http://www.umich.edu">UM</a> has all kinds of programs – <a href="http://www.umtri.umich.edu/">Transportation Research</a>, <a href="http://arc.engin.umich.edu/">ARC</a> – but you have to cheer for the Wolverines and there are some lines I just can’t cross. OK full disclosure – I spent my freshman year in college at UM, I was a traitor to the state of Ohio, but I finally saw the light. * Down in NASCAR country, <a href="http://www.ces.clemson.edu/me/research/index.htm">Clemson</a> has a program. There must be other NASCAR state schools that have programs? * <a href="http://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/">Colorado State</a> from the SAE site is supposed to have a program of some sort. * The <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu/">art center college of design</a> in Pasadena has a program, more focused on aesthetics.</p>

				<p><p>As usual <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">Rich</a> has been a posting machine during the last month. Some of the highlights I’ve noted:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/11/iceland.html">Iceland travel</a>. I hear they have some fantastic river rafting there. I’m ready to go. Just added to my <a href="http://www.43places.com">43places</a> goals. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/14/perfect_ribs_and_grilled_chicken.html">Grilling resource</a> – I can always use grilling tips. * Rich’s <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/14/casio_exlim_exz750.html">small camera recos</a>. I’m about due. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/home_theater/2005/08/22/zoomplayer_rules.html">Tips on HT PC setup</a> – sounds like zoomplayer is essential. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/2005/08/26/ntfs_resizing.html">NTFS resizing tips</a>. I am sure I will need these some day. * Rich is playing <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/games/2005/08/31/fear.html">FEAR</a>. I think I need a new PC. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/08/31/gaming_pc.html">Rich on Gaming PCs</a>. Having bought 3 and bult 2 others, I am inclined to buy from Falcon Northwest for my next. Debugging the assembly of a high end machine with 2 SLI cards, 10K sata drives, raid arrays, fast dvd/cd drives – well it is just a lot easier to let the Falcon guys burn their time.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Very remiss in noting some of the good press that Judy’s Book got in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/15/technology/15ecom.html">NY Times</a> – happened when I was travelling. Nice work guys. Number of postings is growing quickly. (Ignition is an investor in the company)</p>

<p>My favorite Judy’s Book game – be the first to post in a city or area. I’ve staked out Salt Lake City. Love the maps feature.</p>

				<p><p>I’ve upgraded to MT3.2 and decided to blow away all my templates in the process. Because they were old and funky and corrupted and it was just easier to start fresh. In fact I completely blew away my old blog, and reimported all my postings into this one. And just republished over the old one. I am sure there are old files left around from the old blog, that is probably good for google indexing and searching purposes.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks I’ll start selectively adding back features to the template like my Judy’s Book posts, Ohio State football status, blogroll, etc.</p>
