  <h1><a href="/2009/06/01/books-the-walls-of-the-universe-the-stone-gods-the-right-mistake-genesis-the-good-guy-halting-state.html">Books -- The Walls Of The Universe, The Stone Gods, The Right Mistake, Genesis, The Good Guy, Halting State</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “The Walls Of The Universe”:amazon by Paul Melko. Starts out very promising, protagonist and his doppelgänger travelling through a many worlds multiverse, trying to recapture the lives they had. But the deeper emotional themes get swamped by a uninspiring run-of-the-mill conspiracy story. Amazon gives it 4.5 stars, I’d say 3. * “The Stone Gods”:amazon by Jeanette Winterson. Outrage at humanity’s casual misuse of the planet and each other, despair, a smidgen of hope, with hints of Bradbury, LeGuin, Moorcock. Not my taste at all. Amazon says 4 stars, I’d say 2, but some people like this style. * “The Right Mistake”:amazon by Walter Mosley. Great collection of stories about a modern day urban Socrates. Uplifting. Amazon says 4 stars with some saying earlier books in the series are better, I haven’t read them, I liked this one just fine. * “Genesis”:amazon by Bernard Beckett. Modern day retelling of the Genesis story with some twists. Entertaining and thoughtful, short and sweet. Amazon says 4 stars, I’d agree. * “The Good Guy”:amazon by Dean Koontz. Solid action tale. Ending a bit too pat and the underlying conspiracy a bit too standard, but nice tale up to that point. I expected supernatural from Koontz and was pleased that this book was not supernatural. Amazon says 4 stars, I’m good with that. * “Halting State”:amazon by Charles Stross. Good cyber adventure. Stross is reliably entertaining. Another 4 star from Amazon, I like this as well as anything in this set, I might say 4.5 stars.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/05/19/books-alphabet-juice-the-drunkards-walk-outliers-war-as-they-knew-it.html">Books -- Alphabet Juice, The Drunkard&#039;s Walk, Outliers, War As They Knew It</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “Alphabet Juice”:amazon by Roy Blount Jr. Fun wordplay. Probably best read as a bathroom book. If you hate word etymologies, crosswords, etc., don’t bother. Amazon says 4 stars, true if you are a word geek. * “The Drunkard’s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives”:amazon by Leonard Mlodinow. A little plodding at times but a reasonable discussion about the prevalence of chance in our lives and our continual efforts to force cause-and-effect structures on the brownian motion all around us. The key life lesson is this – persevere and swing the bat as often as you can. And be humble about your successes and forgiving of others lack of success, because luck plays a bigger role than talent. Amazon says 4 stars, I’m ok with that * “Outliers: The Story of Success”:amazon by Malcolm Gladwell. A solid magazine article blown up into a book. Success == hard work, built on top of the opportunities provided us by our unique family/culture. Fun anecdotes. Amazon says 4 stars, it is a well-written book, but a little thin.</p>

<p>Actually, reading The Drunkard’s Walk, Outliers, and The Black Swan as a set would not be a terrible idea for most people to learn about randomness, how it will affect your life, and strategies for coping.</p>

<p>* “War As They Knew It: Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler, and America in a Time of Unrest”:amazon by Michael Rosenberg. Good story of the Hayes/Schembechler rivalry years and the times and changes on their campuses during these years. Enjoyed more than I thought I would. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I think this is right if you are a Michigan or OSU fan or big college football fan.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/official_launch_of_the_kindle_dx_13396.asp">Official launch of the Kindle DX - Core77</a>. I bought the Kindle and Kindle2 the instant I could. I am holding off on the DX.  Why?</p>

<p>* It is not clear to me that it enhances recreational reading at all – and in fact the size makes it less convenient</p>

<p>* The cost savings on textbooks aren’t large enough for me to get excited yet</p>

<p>* And more importantly the usage model of a textbook is different than that of a recreational book. Lots of flipping to sections, flipping back and forth, index usage, marking places, etc – does the device make this better?</p>

<p>* Can I use it in an open book exam setting?</p>

<p>So I am not sure yet. Eventually the weight savings may compel me but I am not there yet.</p>

    <p>* “Calculating God”:amazon by Robert Sawyer. Fine first contact tale with a lot of pathos. Amazon says 4 stars, it is a solid effort. * “Atmospheric Disturbances”:amazon by Rivka Galchen. Tale of a psychotic man trying to make sense of his life. Oddly engaging, you want him to succeed. Amazon says 3 stars but very bimodal, you either love or hate this book. * “Family Planning”:amazon by Karan Mahajan. Tale of maturation of eldest son and father in a huge family. Tends towards farce at times which I did not enjoy, but the core relationship stories are good. 5 stars on Amazon, that may be a bit rich, but a good book.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2009/04/goodbye_company.html">Proudly Serving My Corporate Masters: Goodbye Company Picnic</a>. – the continuing transformation of Microsoft. Some of my fondest memories of the company are the events that allowed me to include family – the company picnic (the first one I went to in ‘88 was kind of mindblowing for us), the holiday party (again mindblowing for the kids, the kids’ experience always makes me think of the donkey island bacchanalia scene from Disney’s Pinocchio), halloween. These events did as much to cement my loyalty to the company as 100 other benefits that the company did, they kept my family happy and positive about my job, despite the hours demanded of me. Quite a constrast from the more traditional work environment I came from prior to Microsoft.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/04/25/recent-books-the-atrocity-archives-the-years-pierre-and-jean-days-between-stations.html">Recent books -- The Atrocity Archives, The Years, Pierre and Jean, Days Between Stations</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “The Atrocity Archives”:amazon by Charles Stross. Stross writes a good tale and this is a fine story, collision of witchcraft and information tech. It is one of Stross’s earliest works and a bit choppy in parts (was originally serialized I believe) but still adequate fun. Amazon gives this one 4.5 stars, I would tend a little lower – say 3.5 stars. * “The Years”:amazon by Virginia Woolf. I guess I am not sophisticated enough for this book. I found it to be a shambling wreck. I didn’t care about the people, the times, the situation. The choppy style was unreadable. I gave up 1/4 of the way through. Amazon gives this 4.5 stars too tho with few user ratings, I would give it a 1 star. People are too enamored with the author’s name. * “Pierre and Jean”:amazon by Guy de Maupassant. Sin, shame, betrayal, remorse, sacrifice, blame, loss, a bit of redemption. A great little story of human foibles and the prisons we make in our own minds. Unlike the Woolf above, I’d happily read another de Maupassant. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I’d agree. * “Days Between Stations”:amazon by Steve Erickson. Pour yourself a big mug of absinthe and settle in with this one. Intriguing but strange. Amazon gives it 4.5 stars though not heavily reviewed. I’m probably a little lower but it is an intriguing book.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/04/24/my-current-iphone-app-setup-what-am-i-missing.html">My current iPhone app setup -- what am I missing?</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>On the first page, apps I use every day, multiple times:</p>

<p>* Some of the default Apple apps – Mail, Text, Calendar, Safari (all on the bottom row); Weather, Stocks, Maps, Camera, Calculator (a recent promotion back to the first page, the landscape mode scientific calculator is handy now that I am taking courses at UW again), Settings (purely to switch radio on/off for flights), Clock (for alarm and cooking timing), Phone. * Facebook, Tweetie, Todo (synched with rememberthemilk for todo list management), Tripit (awesome for quick access to trip details – flight status, checkin codes, etc), Wordpress for blogging, Amazon.com. OK Amazon is probably going to fall off soon, I don’t do that much ordering while on the iphone. * 2 Across for nytimes crosswords, and Mafia Wars. Mafia Wars is fun tho the math in the game is kind of whack.</p>

<p>On the second page – apps that i need regular access to, or apps that I am trying out:</p>

<p>* App Store, Shazam (tagging music that I hear on the radio/etc), SmugShot (for access to my photos), MiGhtyDocs (google docs access) * Kayak and Flight Update tho they are declining is use thanks to the Tripit app * Pandora tho also declining in use as I am getting new music via other mechanisms * Trying out: Yelp, Air Sharing, SimpleMindX, FS5 Hockey, FriendCast, fring.</p>

<p>On the third page – apps I keep around because I have to or because I need them occasionally:</p>

<p>* Apple default apps Notes, Contacts, Photos, iTunes, iPod, YouTube. Can’t delete them, they have to go somewhere * Urbanspoon, GuitarToolkit – great apps but I don’t currently use that often. I tend to use google maps for finding restaurants instead of urban spoon * Wine Guide, Starmap, Drinks Free, Clinometer, Remote, Google Earth, RTM, Snaptell. All interesting but I rarely find a reason to use. RTM is just not as good as the Todo app</p>

<p>On the fourth page – games that I liked at one point but that are basically ignored now:</p>

<p>* Tetris, Trism, Bejeweled 2. I’ll still play bejeweled every once in a while * Vector Tanks, iShoot. * Pb Dreams, Flick Bowling, Monkey Ball, XOFootball. * Edge, touchPhysics, Koi Pond, Topple, Rolando, newtonica2. All cute. * Black and White. Pretty poor Othello game. * Dr. Awesome. Awesome actually.</p>

Sounds like your typical entrepreneur would be far better off meeting people and networking than spending time on a plan.  There is probably some minimum level of plan worth getting to, and then after that it is not clear</li>

  <h1><a href="/2009/04/09/recent-books-the-echelon-vendetta-best-american-mystery-stores-scoop.html">Recent books -- The Echelon Vendetta, Best AMerican Mystery Stores, Scoop</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “The Echelon Vendetta”:amazon by David Stone. Good thriller. Deeply damaged hero fighting for the good guys outside the law. And as typical the lines between good and bad, us and them, legal and illegal, are all vague and contradictory. Better than average airplane read. * “The Best American Mystery Stories 2003”:amazon. Another one sitting on the shelf for a while obviously. I don’t typically read short stories but I have renewed admiration for the form. These authors do a great job of plunging you right in – great atmospheres, quick character studies. Fun stuff. * “Scoop”:amazon by Evelyn Waugh. Never read anything by Waugh, this was an offbeat entry point. Farcical misadventure, a sedate country gentleman sent by mistake out as a foreign war correspondent. Some humour but I generally find farces a little wearing.</p>
