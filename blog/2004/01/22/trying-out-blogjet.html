<p>Trying out blogjet on Marc’s reco – <a href="http://blogs.officezealot.com/marc/archives/000198.html" title="Marc's Outlook on Productivity: More on Blogjet">Marc’s Outlook on Productivity: More on Blogjet</a> – it is nice. But it doesn’t really work for me because it assumes you want your post content in a separate paragraph than your title, which is not how i format my entries – for short entries like mine, this creates far too much whitespace for my eye. The lack of underlying code access means I can’t easily fix this. So I have to pass on blogjet.</p>
