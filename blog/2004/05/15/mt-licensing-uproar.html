<p>Our house was flu-ridden this week and I am just catching up on all the discussion about MT 3.0 licensing – good stuff by <a href="http://www.timaoutloud.org/archives/000351.html">Tim</a>, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/05/movable_type_30.shtml">Mena and the changes</a>, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">Mark Pilgrim</a>, <a href="http://www.webmink.net/2004/05/trackbacks-as-zeitgeist.htm">Simon Phipps</a>, <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_blogs/001529.html">Rich</a>. </p>

<p>Personally I have no problem paying for software that I use frequently and will happily pay something for my blog management tool.  The newly modified license looks reasonable.  I’ll look around at other solutions as <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_blogs/001536.html">Rich</a> is doing though I will be cautious in jumping – MT 2.661 is not busted for me, I am not driven to move right away, I’ll let others experiment and I will learn from that.  I have to admire SixApart for modifying their proposal quickly in the face of overwhelming criticism.</p>
