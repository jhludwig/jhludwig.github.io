<p>OK based on this reco – <a href="http://www.movalog.com/archives/templates/index/merging-your-blogs.php" title="Movalog: Merging your blogs">Movalog: Merging your blogs</a> – i installed multiblog last nite. actually went on kind of a plugin install rampage. the install of multiblog and getxml were so easy i decided to try out some more from the <a href="http://mt-plugins.org/3test.php">mt3 tested library</a>. i’ve slowed down tho, as the install of <a href="http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/typemover.php">typemover</a> hasn’t worked quite so well – some path problems.</p>
