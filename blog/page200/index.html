				<p><p>I need a cheap longdistance solution for calls within the US. The calling location is deep inside a building at <a href="http://www.pomona.edu">Pomona College</a> and cell coverage sucks.</p>

<p>Option A is prepaid cards. Genuine ATT cards are availabe on <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?query=at%26t+phone+cards&amp;ht=1&amp;sosortproperty=1&amp;from=R10&amp;BasicSearch=">ebay</a> for about 3.4 cents per minute. Or you can go even cheaper if you go to a site like <a href="http://www.callingcardplus.com">CallingCardPlus</a> -- rates down to .5 cents per minute. I am sure quality on some of these cheap plans is iffy.</p>

<p>The location does have 10mbit ethernet and so VOIP is an option – I wonder what will happen when every student starts using VOIP, I bet the campus net is not engineered for that case. <a href="http://www.pulver.com/fwd/" title="Free World Dialup - by pulver.com">Free World Dialup - by pulver.com</a> is a way to start, seems pretty geeky tho, you have to be a NAT expert – OK for me but not sure this will work for the caller. I wonder if <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> is any easier to use. I definitely want an option that uses a SIP phone or a regular phone, I don’t want to use a PC mic and headphones.</p>

I knew little about the service academies before reading this book, it is a fascinating read. At times I was impressed with West Point; the values that they try to embed in their students are very admirable. At other moments I worried about the end product, as the students seem to be dehumanized and in some ways lose respect for the rest of citizens of their nation. But a great read, very enjoyable, very engaging as it follows the careers and choices of a set of students.</p>

				<p><p>Just finished Al Franken’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0525947647/qid=1062561274/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-7821633-9819810?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right">Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right</a>. I am on average a centrist with a slight tip to the right on economic issues, but I love this book. The far right creeps me out and I love to see Al whack them. This book is basically a hatchet job on the far right press, Fox Network and its ilk. Very funny. There is no real issue examination in the book, Al can be just as self-righteous as the far right, but he does a great job exposing their worst behaviours. Fox was stupid to sue Al, they just gave the book press and a huge sales impetus (It’s number one on Amazon right now), so even more people are going to see Fox reporters and newscasters exposed. Al is not the guy to do this – I’d love to see someone do a serious investigation of why Fox News and its ilk are so popular and successful right now. I just don’t watch it but obviously a lot of people do.</p>
