Among the loser’s bracket (the single-loss teams), Georgia, USC, WSU, and Michigan are the leaders. I suspect that we will end up with two major unbeatens but if the unbeatens falter, look for these teams to sneak in. One of the crazy things about college football is – if you must lose, do it early in the season so that the memory fades.</p>

				<p><p>Spent the weekend in LA. A great place to visit but wow am I glad I live in the Northwest – the smog, lack of greenery, and congestion are so wearing.</p>

<p>Best things we did in LA: Dinner at <a href="http://losangeles.restaurantnotes.com/viewtopic.php?t=368" title="- MAKO in Beverly Hills is outstanding - The Best Los Angeles Restaurant Guides are your fellow diners!">Mako</a> – pan-asian cuisine served tapas-style. Great service and fun food. Lodged at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/losangeles/">Four Seasons</a> – great service, and a veritable freak show of celebrities, celebrity-wanna-bes, celebrity entourages, and plastic surgery victims.</p>

<p>Worst things we did in LA: Rodeo Drive looks like a war zone, don’t bother going until they finish the street work (Christmas? next year?). <a href="http://www.farmersmarketla.com/">Farmer’s Market</a> – a lousy market with lousy restaurants. Come up to Pike Place Market in Seattle instead. <a href="http://www.miramax.com/duplex/">Duplex</a> -- not Ben Stiller’s best work. Funny at times but overall pretty weak.</p>

From Sunday’s LA Times coverage of the game: ?<em>When you get on a streak…you get to thinking it can never happen,</em>? Carroll said. ?<em>It can. You can get beat.?</em></p>

<p>Oregon fell prey to complacency as well this week. ?<em>We were still thinking about the Michigan game and I don’t think we were fired up</em>,? Oregon receiver Sammie Parker said. ?<em>Everyone is usually fired up in the locker room, but we were really quiet today. We were just kind of waltzing around and I don’t think we were ready to play</em>. ?</p>

<p>Now the Pac-10 is basically out of the national championship hunt. A lesson to all the other teams and conferences out there.</p>
