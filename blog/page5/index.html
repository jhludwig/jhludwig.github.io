				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">07 February 2021</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><h2 id="capex">CapEx</h2>

<p>A meandering tour through capital expenditures.  First the semiconductor industry, where it is now estimated to <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2021/01/23/chipmaking-is-being-redesigned-effects-will-be-far-reaching">cost almost $20B to create a state-of-the-art fab</a>.  Fab is now primarily done in SK and Taiwan, which is geopolitically risky for the US.  And our politicians mutter about on-shoring and good manufacturing jobs – losing fab capability to offshore competitors seems like a horrible outcome both economically and geopolitically. Intel is facing this decision with a new CEO, I suspect the US government will find a way to help Intel keep fab capacity in the US.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.platformonomics.com/2021/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2020-retrospective/">Amazon/Google/Microsoft spent $73.5B in CapEx in 2020</a>.  Staggering numbers, particularly Amazon alone.  One has to be really brave to implement any on-prem computing in this market.  It is interesting that Google is falling off a little.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/06/auto-industry-peers-into-an-electric-future-sees-bumps-ahead/">auto industry knows they need to transform into software/chips/battery companies</a> but they are facing a daunting task as CapEx and R&amp;D from the tech world races past automotive CapEx and R&amp;D.  </p>

<p>As software (and silicon) eats the world, the tech players have a distinct advantage.  I’m long Intel, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, NVidia, Tesla.</p>

<h2 id="attention-and-intentionality">Attention and Intentionality</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/opinion/michael-goldhaber-internet.html">attention economy is damaging us as producers and consumers</a>.  We squander our time and attention across 1000s of sources, and we squander our productive energy seeking attention. It is the challenge of our time to find a way to fight through this. </p>

<p><em>Hey John, why are you posting this, aren’t you guilty of fighting for attention like everyone else?</em>  <em>Hmm, you have a point.  To be clear, I mostly write these articles for myself — I find that I don’t really learn something unless I take the time to reflect and write about it.  But I could just as well stick this in a diary and not share it with the world.</em> <em>Hmm.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1356987055482359810?s=20">Bezos on high standards</a> – powerful and simple.  And partly explains to me why I bother to publish these thoughts publicly.  If I am writing just for myself, I can be sloppy and imprecise.  Knowing that I am going to share these publicly forces me to be more thoughtful, more precise, more attentive, and I get some feedback on the quality of my thinking.</p>

<p><a href="https://ceklog.kindel.com/2021/02/03/how-to-be-a-secret-agent-of-change/">Charlie Kindel on how to be a change agent</a> — this is a nice framework, I have often failed to segment and prioritize the stakeholders and have wasted time and energy on the opposed.  I have not been intentional enough about how to create change. Thank you Charlie.</p>

<p>The entire point of these postings may be – forcing myself to be more intentional about what I think on and what I learn.</p>

<h2 id="political-life">Political Life</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/01/ohio-gov-mike-dewine-wants-50-million-market-progressive-state/4342873001/">Ohio Governor DeWine wants $50M to market Ohio as a great progressive place to live</a>.  And apparently the <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/snow-ridden-ohio-plays-off-seattles-rainy-weather-clever-ad-campaign-attract-jobs/">marketing spend is already happening</a>. As many observers point out, this is not really a marketing problem.  If DeWine wants Ohio to be seen as a progressive destination for progressive industries and progressive people, DeWine and the Ohio government actually have to implement progressive policies — where does the state stand on healthcare access, on education funding, on minimum wage and income equality, on equal rights and voting rights?  And Ohio has to elect progressive leaders — Jim Jordan is the most visible political face in the state.  I have great affection for Ohio, and I know there are progressive people and progressive urban areas in the state, but overall the state has work to do.</p>

<h2 id="random">Random</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/01/30/pickleball-is-the-fastest-growing-sport-in-america">Pickleball is the fastest growing sport in America</a>. Don’t forget <a href="https://eniacday.org/about-us">ENIAC day</a> is coming up. There is a <a href="http://theponzibook.blogspot.com">website dedicated to reporting on Ponzi scheme activities</a> – criminality and gullibility are evergreen.</p>

I’ve been reflecting this week on how fortunate I have been to work with so many great people.  I met some great people on the path thru <a href="http://Surround.io">Surround.io</a> to Xevo to Lear, and I hope I get to work with some of them again.   I will not remember the details of various technical and business decisions, but I will remember the people and the great interactions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49679332-hidden-valley-road">Early treatments for schizophrenia</a> included ingestion of cocaine, manganese, and castor oil; injections of animal blood and oil of turpentine; gassed with CO2 or O2; insulin-induced comas.  And of course lobotomy. We look back at that and shake our heads. What medical treatments or other practices are we doing now that we will look back on negatively? At every point in our history we have looked back and judged our former selves, this point in time is no different.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://militarypay.defense.gov/Portals/3/Documents/ActiveDutyTables/2020%20Military%20Basic%20Pay%20Table.pdf">highest ranking generals/admirals in the US Armed Forces make about $200K a year</a>.  Those are huge, important, stressful jobs.  Makes one wonder about executive salaries.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/science/six-stars-eclipses.html">Scientists have found a sextuply eclipsing sextuple star system</a>.  I just love that sentence.</p>

<p><a href="https://skamille.medium.com/make-boring-plans-9438ce5cb053">Make boring plans</a>, <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">choose boring technology</a>.  Of course these ideas have been around, as I reflect on my most recent startup journey, I certainly learned that you have to be very thoughtful and selective about risk, and on many fronts you should choose the boring path.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360562.Sharpe_s_Rifles">Sharpe’s Rifles</a> by Bernard Cornwell. Enjoyable historical novel set during the Napoleonic Wars, a part of a series detailing Sharpe’s rise. Good character, good pacing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4191136-business-adventures">Business Adventures</a> by John Brooks. An insouciant (and I never get to use that word, so damn it, I am pulling it out of the vault when it fits) walk thru business stories of the 50s and 60s. Lyrical, notes of Faulkner, not your traditional business book. And the time machine back into business operations of 60 years ago is fascinating.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51342031-the-ministry-for-the-future">The Ministry for the Future</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson. This is the worst good book I have ever read. Too long. A mishmash of wholly different stories which doesn’t work. Too much yelling at the reader instead of delivering a message through story and character. And yet, I read the whole thing, No book has really illustrated how horrible climate change can become as does this book in a few places. I can’t recommend this book, but it may be worth reading.</li>

				<p><p>We have been moving houses this week so not as much time as I would like to dig into some things but still a few nuggets.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-mathematical-model-unlocks-the-secrets-of-vision-20190821/">The information passed between the retina and visual cortex is sparse</a><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-mathematical-model-unlocks-the-secrets-of-vision-20190821/">.</a> Most of what we think we are seeing is a construct in the brain.  Fascinating. I am sure this is common knowledge to a lot of people.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobileye-lidar-on-a-chip-intel/">Lidar is getting ever cheaper and smaller</a> — Moore’s law is cranking away.  When Lidar is basically free, what all will we do with, what apps will it enable?  I love how our Roborock vacuum uses lidar to create its map.  How else will we use in the home?  How will it affect home security apps?  What games will we create?</p>

<p>Good news, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/13/yellow-mealworm-safe-for-humans-to-eat-says-eu-food-safety-agency">yellow mealworm is now approved for human consumption</a>. Unless you have prawn or dust mite allergies. Purportedly clear economic and environmental benefits. What will we be commonly eating in 50 years that was previously unthinkable?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/riverscuomo/status/1351216170234499075?s=21">Rivers Cuomo is thinking about learning flutter/dart</a>.  I wonder what programming environments the Beatles or Prince or other artists would have chosen.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/01/18/leak-zoom-meeting/">Audio watermarks – I didn’t realize these existed in Zoom</a>.  I expect there to be a tool in about 30 seconds to strip them or to modify them.</p>

				<p><ul>
  <li>Your strategy is what you ship.  I didn’t learn this so much as I relearned it.  The story of the Edsel in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4191136-business-adventures">Business Adventures</a> is instructive. The Ford team dreamed of an innovative, breakthrough vehicle that would wow customers and capture a new market segment.  But what they delivered was an undifferentiated high-priced low-quality car, and we all know the results.  35 years ago in my first real job, the late <a href="https://obits.cleveland.com/obituaries/cleveland/obituary.aspx?n=thomas-c-jones&amp;pid=188407136&amp;fhid=10508">Tom Jones</a> told me “Your strategy is what you ship” and I have learned this a dozen times in my career.</li>
  <li>I know nothing about the modern gaming economy.  I have not played video games actively for about 6 years as I’ve been busy with a day job, and I do not understand the modern gaming economy at all, but I am fascinated by — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225416/thegrefg-record-fortnite-viewers-icon-skin-reveal-eu-heretics?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225416/thegrefg-record-fortnite-viewers-icon-skin-reveal-eu-heretics?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.videoscribe.co/en/">Videoscribe</a>. We use powerpoint decks for live presentations and for leave-behind reading.  They kind of suck for leave-behind reading; I experimented with <a href="https://www.videoscribe.co/en/">Videoscribe</a> to make a more dynamic leave-behind that better captures the story, pacing, flow, etc.   I like it a lot and will keep exploring this.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eleemosynary">Eleemosynary</a> is the word of the week, totally new to me.  And on first look, I couldn’t even make a reasonable guess about meaning.  </li>
  <li>Best practices from around the world. <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/short-thoughts-bloomberg-roundup">Noah Smith</a> makes a good point this week – “America needs to humble itself and start copying best practice from countries that have things figured out more than we do, instead of imagining that we can reinvent the wheel”. So true, and particularly so in healthcare, where we spend more money and achieve worse results than nearly every other modern democracy.</li>

  <li>I know nothing about the modern gaming economy.  I have not played video games actively for about 6 years as I’ve been busy with a day job, and I do not understand the modern gaming economy at all, but I am fascinated by — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225416/thegrefg-record-fortnite-viewers-icon-skin-reveal-eu-heretics?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225416/thegrefg-record-fortnite-viewers-icon-skin-reveal-eu-heretics?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.videoscribe.co/en/">Videoscribe</a>. We use powerpoint decks for live presentations and for leave-behind reading.  They kind of suck for leave-behind reading; I experimented with <a href="https://www.videoscribe.co/en/">Videoscribe</a> to make a more dynamic leave-behind that better captures the story, pacing, flow, etc.   I like it a lot and will keep exploring this.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eleemosynary">Eleemosynary</a> is the word of the week, totally new to me.  And on first look, I couldn’t even make a reasonable guess about meaning.  </li>
  <li>Best practices from around the world. <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/short-thoughts-bloomberg-roundup">Noah Smith</a> makes a good point this week – “America needs to humble itself and start copying best practice from countries that have things figured out more than we do, instead of imagining that we can reinvent the wheel”. So true, and particularly so in healthcare, where we spend more money and achieve worse results than nearly every other modern democracy.</li>

				<p><p>I aspire to be a lifelong learner. I do read a lot – books and online – and I find increasingly that if I don’t take a few moments to write down and reflect on what I learned, then I don’t really learn it. So am starting a new attempt to document interesting things I learned each week. Inspired in part by <a href="https://medium.com/fluxx-studio-notes/52-things-i-learned-in-2020-6a380692dbb8">Tom Whitwell</a>, referred to by <a href="http://www.markfrauenfelder.com">Mark Frauenfelder</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/clams-measure-water-quality-poland-fat-kathy/">Warsaw uses clams to monitor its water supply</a>. We would need a vast array of sensors and AI machinery to do the same with computers, and we probably don’t know what all things to sense or what models to build. Instead, we just rely on some clams to be clams. Fascinating collaboration with nature and thought-provoking, can we collaborate similarly in other areas?</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.a-ibs.com/en/blog/article/green-apples-blue-apples-color-perception-in-japanese.html">There are cultures that do not discriminate between the colors blue and green</a>, including Japan historically. I’ve read other pieces on the history of color perception, very interesting that this is somewhat variable across human cultures, it seems so foundational. What else is not as foundational as we think?</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_101">There is a large tuned mass damper inside the Taipei 101 building</a> and other large skyscrapers. Which makes sense and at some level I probably knew this, but interesting to see in action.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin">Sea urchins have 5-fold symmetry</a>. I am still trying to parse the explanation for why this evolved, it doesn’t seem obvious.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemipenis">Lizards have 2 penises</a>. I guess this is no more unnatural than having two arms, legs, eyes, ears, kidneys, etc. Bilateral symmetry is easier to understand in animals than 5-fold symmetry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and how fragile our democracy is, and how inspiring it is to see a large cross section of our society rise and start to defend it.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">01 January 2021</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>This year I read or attempted to read 75 books.  There were some dogs but also some great ones.  I tried to come up with the “best book of the year” but that is pointless, they are all so different.  So I will highlight a number of different books that excelled in different ways. </p>

<p><strong>Best Mystery</strong>:  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/523795.The_Last_Good_Kiss">The Last Good Kiss</a> by James Crumley.  A solid hard-bitten detective tale, everything you want in a private eye.  </p>

<p><strong>Best Adventure</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora">The Lies of Locke Lamora</a> by Scott Lynch.  If you like more fantastical adventures, this is a great tale and really ought to be a movie or TV series.</p>

<p><strong>Best Historical Novel</strong>:  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38140077-washington-black">Washington Black</a> by Esi Edugyan.  If you like your adventures a little more grounded in historical reality, this is for you.  Would also be fantastic on screen.</p>

<p><strong>Best History</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50159458-kent-state">Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio</a> by Derf Backderf.  If you like actual history, this is a great telling of the events at Kent State, and exposes the dangers of involving armed military in civil protests.  Almost chose this for best graphic novel, but for…</p>

<p><strong>Best Graphic Novel</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51323365-solutions-and-other-problems">Solutions and Other Problems</a> by Allie Brosh.  Irreverent, at times hilarious, at times moving.  Well done.  </p>

<p><strong>Best Irreverent</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28881.Lamb">Lamb, The Gospel According to Biff, Christ’s Childhood Pal</a> by Christoper Moore. Irreverent, some may even view as offensive, but I found it respectful and uplifting in a humanist way.</p>

<p><strong>Best Current Events</strong>:  Getting back to our current situation and lives, there are 3 books that I enjoyed and gave me some insight on myself or the world.  </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50165554-one-billion-americans">One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger</a> by Matthew Yglesias.  You might object to his solution but this book clearly focuses on a challenge we face, and it is hard to imagine solutions that don’t involve growth.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth">The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics</a> by Eric Beinhocker.  A worthy effort to reexamine economics from first principles.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152447-caste">Caste: The Origins of our Discontents</a> by Isabel Wilkerson.  There are many books you can read on discrimination and racism in our society, this was the best for me.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best Math/Science</strong>.  Digging a little deeper, these were the math/science books that I enjoyed the most this year.  </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36341728-lost-in-math">Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray</a> by Sabine Hossenfelder.  A criticism of current thinking in physics.  I don’t follow physics closely enough to know if this is all warranted.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting">Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction</a> by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner.  We all forecast in our lives, and we are probably all not that great at it, as this book will make you realize.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27068734-but-what-if-we-re-wrong-thinking-about-the-present-as-if-it-were-the-pa">But What If We’re Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past</a> by Chuck Klosterman.  Challenges your thinking about what you know and believe, which is always good.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Would love to hear your thoughts on books you read this year.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35667296-eternal-life">Eternal Life</a> by Dara Horn. Explores that the idea that a very long life renders meaningless most life events.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7236997-the-native-star">The Native Star</a> by M. K. Hobson. Fun adventure thru an 1800s America where magic is a normal thing. Perhaps not very differentiated ground but a fun tale nevertheless. Makes me want to read more in the series.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6004724-the-snakehead">The Snakehead</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe. Inside the illegal immigration trade for a period of the 90s. A rough trade, amazing what people will go through for a chance to better their lives and their family’s lives.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31253737-an-american-sickness">An American Sickness</a> by Elisabeth Rosenthal. An anecdote-driven walk through the dysfunctional health care industry. Some enraging anecdotes, and some useful how-to’s at the end. Would have liked even more data but overall a very useful read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36602943-the-origin-of-wealth">The Origin of Wealth</a> by Eric D. Beinhocker. An excellent book, re-establishing the basis of economics and wealth from first principles, overturning a lot of the traditional economics I learned once upon a time. Very satisfying to see economics built up as emergent behaviors from the actions of individuals, and to see the incorporation of uncertainty, imperfect information, and iteration. Not a complete story but excellent.</li>
