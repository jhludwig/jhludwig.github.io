  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starless-Sea-Novel-Erin-Morgenstern-ebook/dp/B07MQPHKSL">The Starless Sea</a> by Erin Morgenstern. I am ambivalent. Certainly the story is creative, and much work was done to plot it out. But I am not really convinced the story went anywhere. I was compelled to finish but I don’t know I will remember much.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Have-Heard-True/dp/0525560378">What You Have Heard Is True</a> by Carolyn Forche. Brutal look at El Salvador during the Civil War in the 80s and 90s. Horrible. We have done so little in the US for our Central American neighbors, and actually have been behind so many terrible people.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daisy-Jones-Taylor-Jenkins-Reid-ebook/dp/B07DMZ5YR9">Daisy Jones &amp; The Six</a> by Taylor Jenkins Reid. I would not normally seek out a Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick but this was a great tale of rock and roll, drugs, sex, love, betrayal, forgiveness, redemption, consequences, responsibility. Tore through it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-State-Thriller-Chris-Hauty-ebook/dp/B07RPP4NN9">Deep State</a> by Chris Hauty. Embarrassed to say I read this – shoddy characters, shoddy dialog. But enthralling, couldn’t put it down, nice twists.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sunnyside-Glen-David-Gold/dp/0307454983">Sunnyside</a> by Glen David Gold. No idea why I bought this years ago. I like weird and this was too weird to finish.</li>

A space exploration trip returns to Earth after centuries away and can barely relate to the evolved human culture. And so on. Fun.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Institute-Novel-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B07N943MFX">The Institute</a> by Stephen King. Very average Stephen King. So still highly entertaining but not amazing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Line-Jack-Reacher-Novel-ebook/dp/B06WP486XH">The Midnight Line</a> by Lee Child. Another Jack Reacher book, a very good one, dealing with a missing veteran who may be a criminal or a hero or both.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tropic-Kansas-Novel-Christopher-Brown/dp/0062563815">Tropic of Kansas</a> by Christopher Brown. A fascist nationalist leader arises in the US in the 1980s. Years later we follow along as young rebels try to undo the damage. Very entertaining.</li>

</ul>

<p>Owning a good EV is a transformational experience. Is my Tesla as good in all respects as a traditional car? No. But it is so dramatically better in a few regards that I will never go back to an internal combustion engine vehicle. And I don’t think this is discernible in focus groups or other traditional market research vehicles.</p>

<p>I am reminded of 1988 when I joined Microsoft. I sat in meetings with senior leaders from DEC who regularly pooh-poohed the PC. And they were “right”, the PC was primitive and incomplete. And in 10 years DEC was gone as an independent entity, despite their amazing technical and business strengths, despite being “right” in their judgement about the PC.</p>

<p>When the tide comes in, you don’t want to be trying to fight it.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">07 October 2019</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>We get to spend two days with strategy consultants this week. I spent the first four years of my career as a strategy consultant and I have some perspective.</p>

<p>Strategy is not some task you do every once in a while as executives. Strategy formulation, implementation, testing, and revision is a daily, hourly task. The best operators in the company are deeply involved in it. Sales people are pitching your strategy, and getting data back from customers on acceptance, pricing, competitive alternatives, and unmet needs. Product people are implementing, identifying unexpected hurdles, and finding new innovations every day. Everyone is trying out competitive products, seeing competitive moves, every day.</p>

<p>Every day all this info needs to be processed by the org, and the strategy needs to adapt. Strategy formulation and reformulation is thus totally intermingled with operations, and the best orgs are incredibly nimble at incorporating all the daily data and evolving strategy.</p>

<p>Strategies created outside the operating team often fail because they are not realistic – they are not implementable, they don’t account for what is really happening in the technology or with the customers, they are uninformed by the daily competitive pressure the operating team faces. And the operating teams knows all this, and so doesn’t buy into the strategy.</p>

<p>While I was a strategy consultant, I was presenting some brilliantly conceived strategy to one of our senior partners, Tom. Tom had been in the consulting business a long time and had seen a jillion businesses. He listened to my presentation, and then said “this is all nice, but your strategy is what you ship”.</p>

<p>It was an aha moment for me that has stuck with me ever since.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">15 September 2019</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Tesla is just kicking ass in car apps — <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/09/15/tesla-v10-first-look-release-notes-features/">https://electrek.co/2019/09/15/tesla-v10-first-look-release-notes-features/</a>.   They made an investment in a UX and data architecture and it is paying off.  Most carmakers are targeting where Tesla was 18-24 months ago, and by the time their cars ship, they will be even further behind.  </p>

<p>The carmakers have some options, none of which are easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embrace the phone.  Support Android Auto and CarPlay, give up on competing on base car UX and apps, and build auto-specific features and services on top of Android Auto and CarPlay.  This is not a terrible strategy, carmakers can focus their energy on car-specific features.  Xevo works with a number of carmakers on upcoming solutions along these lines, these will be good experiences.</li>
  <li>Try to drag race Tesla.  Some carmakers are trying this, it will be difficult to win this drag race if the carmaker is not tapping into software development talent in one of the software development centers — Bay Area, Seattle, NYC.  Xevo works with a couple of OEMs on this basis, tapping into the great Seattle ecosystem and labor market.  This is a tough strategy though and maybe the highest risk strategy.</li>
  <li>Leapfrog Tesla.  Open up the car UX and car data to a full software ecosystem.  Get 10,000 companies targeting the vehicles.  Carmakers are historically resistant to this, wanting to hold onto all aspects of car UX and car data, but just as the industry transitioned from feature phones to smartphones, the industry will make a transition to a more open car software ecosystem, and benefits will accrue to those who lead the transition.  Xevo also works with OEMs on this basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>These strategies are not mutually exclusive — every carmaker has many nameplates, model years, and regions — they have a lot of at bats, and can try out variants of these strategies, and learn from each trial.  The key thing is to set a reach goal for the software ecosystem in the car, and get moving aggressively on some of these strategies.</p>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Golem-Jinni-Novel-P-S/dp/0062110845">The Golem and the Jinni</a> by Helene Wecker. In the late 1800s in NYC, a golem and a jinni struggle to fit into human society and become human themselves. Very entertaining and a nicely introspective about what defines humanity. I’d had this on the Kindle forever, Vlad goaded me into reading.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcadia-Iain-Pears/dp/1101970839">Arcadia</a> by Iain Pears. A fantasy, science fiction, time travel, mystery, adventure, book within a book. A lot going on in here and very engaging.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464345">Homo Deus</a> by Yuval Noah Harari. Some compelling ideas but boy a lot of words. And in the last third of the book he goes off the rails, he has a mechanistic view of science and biology that feels very off. Still a good read but could be better.</li>
