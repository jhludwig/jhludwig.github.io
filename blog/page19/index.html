				<p><p>While we wait for the bowl season to kick off, what to do, what to do.</p>

<p>Interesting to look at 2015 schedules. Given how the playoff selection worked out – with conference championship game winners having a clear advantage, and non-FBS games dragging teams down, look at who is in trouble for making the 2015 playoffs already:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Big 12 teams. No championship game, and games like Baylor-Lamar, K State-UTSA, K State-South Dakota, TCU-SFA, WVU-Liberty, WVU-Georgia Southern. These teams start out with two strikes against them, they have no margin for error. Only an undefeated Big 12 team has a hope of making the playoff.</li>
  <li>ACC – Clemson-Wofford, FSU-Texas State, FSU-Chattanooga, Louisville-Samford, VT-Furman. One strike against, these teams better hope they look good the rest of the season.</li>
  <li>Pac12 – Oregon-Georgia State, UW-Sacramento State, AZ-UTSA, AZ-Northern AZ, ASU-Cal Poly, USC-Idaho.</li>
  <li>SEC – because of these perceived strength of the SEC, most of these schools will probably get a pass on playing one FCS opponent, tho they should be embarrassed. But Georgia and Auburn both load up with two, not going to help them.</li>
</ul>

<p>WIll be interesting to see if any schedule changes happen for 2015 or 2016. If I was an AD of a serious team, I’d be looking to eliminate this cruft.</p>

Well, mystery no more. Starting in 2016 all ticket holders will get to pick seats in priority order based on their total giving standing. The brochure that OSU sent out has a handy stadium map and an estimated number of points needed to sit in a certain area, and the giving you need to do to get those points.</p>

<p>For example, you want 50 yard line eastside seats in the A section? 4500 points are expected to be needed, and if you haven’t given a dime, your 2015 gift will convert to points at a 4% rate, so a gift of $112,500 will get you in!</p>

<p>Prefer 50 yard line B deck? 2000 points, or $50k and you are in the bidding. C-deck end zone? A mere 100 points or a mere $2500. Your prior accrued gifts convert at a 2% rate, so those dollars still count.</p>

<p>It will be fascinating to see a) if people rush in 2015 in buy their way up the priority ladder, and b) how much OSU goads everyone to do this. I am looking forward to the “We’re sorry, but you’ve been pushed into C-Deck, only 30 days left in 2015 to secure your old seats” email.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">18 November 2014</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I’ve had several people mention some other low-end hardware platforms to me recently – of course the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/bone">beagle bone</a> series, the intel galileo and edison products, and a couple others. All nice looking hardware with nice features.</p>

<p>And I am not spending any time with them. Because they lack the two most critical features of the Raspberry Pi – price and availability. If I need 100 Pis tomorrow, I can get them. And they are the cheapest thing going. The pricing on some of the Intel parts is wildly uncompetitive.</p>

<p>The open source linux software stack on the Pi is important too. Means I don’t have to worry about lockin, we can shift to another hardware platform easily.</p>

<p>All this adds up to a platform with really low trial friction – easy and cheap to acquire, no concerns about lockin. There is a reason they’ve sold ~4M and that the sales rate is apparently accelerating. And that is turning into an ecosystem advantage.</p>

<p>The exact technical features of the Pi are largely irrelevant. There are technical and design aspects of the Pi that I hate. I am sure the beaglebones have a better frimplestat and the intel parts are superior at ruzzmutzing and the nvidia tegra boards have nice plurblegots or whatever. But they all miss the availability, price, low friction marks. And are missing the emerging ecosystem advantage.</p>

				<p><p>I’ve kept a home-built Windows box around for years tho most of my work has shifted to Apple and Linux platforms. But I still had some strange emotional tie, and I still played a Steam game on a regular basis.</p>

<p>But as you can tell from my lack of posting, real work has displaced blogging and game-playing. And the unusability of Windows 8 broke any other attachment I had.</p>

<p>I needed another Ubuntu box for testing, so I just paved over Windows 8 tonight. No real sadness, I left the platform long ago, but still a passing. I had a nice beer and we watched “The Good Wife” to celebrate.</p>

				<p><p>It has been a little rocky but we are finally self-hosting this week. It is going to probably be a disaster but I was <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/complaint-driven-development/">reminded of this post today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have your team and yourself start using that minimum viable product, every day, all day long. This is way more than mere software development: it’s your whole life. If you aren’t living in the software you’re building, each day, every day, all day … things are inevitably going to end in tears for everyone involved. And honestly, if I have to explain this to you, guess what? You’re screwed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The need to self-host using real customer configurations as soon as possible was “beaten” into me during my formative years in the software business (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/bradsilverberg">Brad</a>), and it is a vital step and exciting step.</p>

<p>I was most excited today because I accidentally left the system running and came back 3 hours later and it was still churning away! That is a great sign.</p>

<p>BTW if you want to help…<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2014/10/were-hiring/">we are hiring</a>…drop me a note.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goldfinch-Donna-Tartt-ebook/dp/B00BAXFECK/">The Goldfinch</a> by Donna Tartt. A wild trip thru a life marked by disasters, some external, some self-created, with a lot of introspection about life along the way. Dense but I couldn’t put it down. <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/goldfinch.jpeg"><img src="images/goldfinch.jpeg" alt="goldfinch" /></a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patrick-Melrose-Novels-Never-Mothers-ebook/dp/B00B8SAHJC">The Patrick Melrose Novels</a> by Edward St. Aubyn. Very well written set of books about a life among the English upper class. Very engaging, tho the characters are all hateful, misanthropic, abusive people. I’ve stuck with it quite a while but ultimately the misanthropy is wearing me down. Glad these are not the circles I run in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Run-Fugitive-Fieldwork-Encounters-Discoveries-ebook/dp/B00JHCNVNU">On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City</a> by Alice Goffman. Really poorly written but great insight into life of an oppressed minority in America today. Very topical and inspirational.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Divergent-Trilogy-Book-1-ebook/dp/B004CFA9RS">Divergent</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Insurgent-Divergent-Trilogy-Book-2-ebook/dp/B00655U3WE">Insurgent</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Allegiant-Divergent-Trilogy-Book-3-ebook/dp/B00BD99JMW">Allegiant</a> by Veronica Roth. Saw the first movie on a flight and thought it was fun. The first book is clearly the strongest, too much dithering about in the middle, but ends strong.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Acceptance-Novel-Southern-Reach-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00ILWNU2E/">Acceptance</a> by Jeff VanderMeer. Brings the Southern Reach trilogy to a close. Finally, halfway thru this book, I finally tripped to what the major themes of the trilogy were. The third book gets a little too mystical at times but still a very engrossing (tho at times challenging) read.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Letters-Note-Collection-Correspondence-Deserving-ebook/dp/B00IPYLUO8">Letters of Note</a> by Shaun Usher. Culled from the website, interesting insight into some historical figures.</p>
