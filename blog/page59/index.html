    <p>Dry run last night:</p>

<p>* Foggers in good shape. Large fogger ran fine on about a 12.5% duty cycle, will crank up by Halloween night. 3 point foggers (Cujo’s doghouse, mausoleum, tree) all worked fine. Will need to check fog fluid levels. * Sound systems all operational. Thunder and lightning sounds good, Mausoleum sounds good, Courtyard good, Tree good. Main entrance good. Doghouse levels seem a little off. * lighting all good. Lightning, spots, uv spots all operational. Added LED eyes to skeletons today * major props all functional. active props all working – tree, crate, FCG. Static props all holding together.</p>

<p>Good to go!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2007/10/27/apple-starbucks-att-and-t-mobile-suck.html">Apple, Starbucks, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile Suck</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK so I am in the grocery store this AM trying to check college football scores on my iPhone and what do I get? The stupid T-Mobile homepage because there is a Starbucks next door. And to support the iTunes store Apple slams you on to the stupid T-Mobile network, but no other web connectivity is allowed. This sucks. Here in the land of Starbucks, there is a Starbucks T-Mobile Wifi net about every 100 yards, so basically I have to turn off Wifi service continually. Sucks.</p>

<p>Apple – how is this a freaking benefit? You should let all my non-iTunes traffic default to a different wifi provider or edge. Starbucks – this is driving me out of your stores and pissing me off at you even when I am next door! You need to provide free Wifi. AT&amp;T – this is completely screwing with customer perception of the network performance of the device. You need to help Apple get non-iTunes traffic onto your net. T-Mobile – I am never ever going to pay for your stupid service. You had better figure out fast how to shift to a free service business model or you will become completely irrelevant.</p>

    <p>I certainly would not have predicted 15 years ago that Apple would have returned to such glory. <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/50765-apple-s-iphone-builds-huge-lead-in-customer-satisfaction" title="Apple's iPhone Builds Huge Lead in Customer Satisfaction - Seeking Alpha">Apple’s iPhone Builds Huge Lead in Customer Satisfaction - Seeking Alpha</a> – they are building a huge lead in the cellphone space (thanks for the article Cam).

<p>I had an Apple ][ a million years ago, I bought a Mac the first day they were on the market, it is great to see them do so well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I am sorry as hell that I got sucked into Vista and particularly Vista 64 – here is a <a href="http://www.edbott.com/weblog/?p=1801">typical tale of woe</a> – installing most software just doesn’t work.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2007/10/22/latest-reads.html">Latest Reads</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “Shibumi”:amazon by Trevanian. The first Trevanian I’ve read, a lot of fun. OK the characters are a caricatures but still a fun romp. * “A flag for sunrise”:amazon by Robert Stone. A bunch of Americans stumble around like bulls in a china shop in a fictional central American country during the cold war. They demonstrate just how ineffectual an intrusive foreign policy can be. It is difficult to navigate in and have impact on a culture in which you have no basis. * “The lessons of history”:amazon by Will and Ariel Durant. This is a slim tome, hard to find. Recommended to me by my historian partner Jon Roberts, it is an excellent set of essays on the broad sweep of history and what it all means. A key observation made is this: while we have made all kinds of gaudy technological progress, human nature has not changed, and our societies and governments and current events look a lot like they have looked for the past 4000 years. Of course the particular mixture is always new but the broad sweep of events hasn’t changed much. Nationalism, religious fervor, rich and poor, class strife – none of this is new or surprising. * “Promise Me”:amazon and “The Final Detail”:amazon and “Backspin”:amazon by Harlan coben. Three good bolitar tales. Backspin by Harlan coben. I’ve read a lot of coben’s tales but these are the first in the myron bolitar series I’ve read. Quite fun! Bolitar is a sports agent cum detective with a collection of quirky associates. * “Pandora’s Star”:amazon by Peter F Hamilton. Galaxy spanning epic. A host of unique ideas about human society and alien life, not quite enough character development. A bit wordy in explaining some of the concepts, would have been better served to just let characters make the point, but this is typical for the science fiction genre. Entertaining enough for me to get the concluding book.</p>

Seems dumb to me – how many of us ever actually look at our meter? OK if I had a webpage for my meter and could see that, maybe.</p>

<p>But what i want is direct feedback on the device I am using. When I crank my thermostat, I want it to tell me right there what my decisions will cost me this month. When I turn on the lights, I want feedback right at the switch. I want a channel on my tv that tells me the energy usage of my tv/video setup. Feedback needs to be embedded right in the device if you really want to make consumers more aware.</p>

    <p>And sloppy basketball at that. <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/gamecenter/teamstats/NCAAF_20070906_MITNST@LOU" title="NCAA Football Team Stats - CBSSports.com">NCAA Football Team Stats - CBSSports.com</a> – almost 1300 yards of offense between the teams. and 5 fumbles, 2 ints in the game. 28 penalties and 328 penalty yards. Sloppy! I can’t believe in Louisville as a top 10 team with this kind of play.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2007/09/06/microsoft-windows-search-indexer-stopped-working-and-was-closed.html">Microsoft Windows Search Indexer stopped working and was closed</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Not sure why Vista decided it needed to tell me this, but this forum provides tips on fixing – <a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-vista-support/138952-microsoft-windows-search-indexer-stopped-working-closed.html" title="Microsoft Windows Search Indexer stopped working and was closed - Tech Support Forum">Microsoft Windows Search Indexer stopped working and was closed - Tech Support Forum</a> – basically you have to manually delete all the temporary working files for search. You’d think Vista could do that for you. Possibly related to the fact that my reliability index is 1.97 and I am getting multiple blue screens a day – thanks BioShock.</p>

    <p>A new field for me – <a href="http://www.attoworld.de/publications/AttosecSpectro.html" title=".:: Attosecond Spectroscopy ::.">.:: Attosecond Spectroscopy ::.</a> – introduced to by a recent review article in Science magazine. Fascinating – spectroscopy at the electron level, the ability to see electron changes as atoms bond, etc.</p>
