				<p><p>@chrisfhoward reminded me of my own post today – <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2001/10/icebergs/">A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way » Blog Archive » Icebergs</a>. A good reminder for me. I also think a lot these days about the leaders in our financial industries taking home $10M+, $100M+ earnings for the year – how are they behaving when they are at the top of the iceberg?</p>

<p>The entire original post inserted below:</p>

<p>L brought home a paper last week on the “Iceberg” analogy for teams. How just a little bit of an iceberg peeks above the water, but it has a whole huge structure supporting its exposed surface, and how that whole structure is necessary for the top of the iceberg to achieve its height. And in teams – every player is important and contributes to the success of the team, even the players on the bench.</p>

<p>I love the Iceberg analogy for teams. Let me extend it!</p>

<p>Life is long. During our lives we will get to be on literally thousands of teams. Sports teams. Teams working on a lab problem or school project. Teams working on projects at church. Working as part of a community group. Working as a member of a nonprofit board. At the workplace as part of a project team. As part of a special project taskforce. A family working together on housework, on vacation planning, on holiday preparations, on the everyday tasks of housekeeping. For fun as part of a choir or stage production.</p>

<p>Literally your entire life will be spent as part of teams. There are very few truly solitary endeavors in life.</p>

<p>Our position on each of these teams will be different. Sometimes we will be a leader because of our experience and competence in the subject area. Sometimes we will be a learner because of relative inexperience. Sometimes we will get the public spotlight as the face of the team. Sometimes we will toil away in relative obscurity. And most often we will be doing all these each day – part of one team in the morning at work, a different in the afternoon, yet another in the evening at home or in the community.</p>

<p>We will all get to experience the full range of roles. Some of these roles will be amazingly gratifying. Some will be less fulfilling. But no on is on top of the iceberg their whole life, we will all get our turn on the top and on the bottom.</p>

<p>The true measure of our self worth is not where we are in the iceberg. We are going to be in different places at different times in our lives.</p>

<p>The true measure of our self worth is how we comport ourselves as we fulfill our role. When we are at the top – do we express humility and thankfulness, do we try to teach others the way up, do we show understanding and compassion for those in other roles? When we are at the bottom – do we seek to understand the strengths of those above, do we seek to learn from them, do we strive hard knowing that the other roles will be strengthened if we work our hardest?</p>

<p>Emotionally it feels better to be at the top. But in the words of someone I once worked with, “Success is a lousy teacher”. I probably have learned the most in my life from some of my time spent elsewhere in the iceberg.</p>

				<p><p>* “The Prophet”:amazon by Kahlil Gibran. Been on the shelf for years, finally read it. Simple poetical musing on the big issues of life. Quick read, worth a moment – the section on parenting touched me most. * “Daemon”:amazon by Daniel Suarez. Fun cyber terror romp. Many parts scarily possible. “Fun” understates the book, it was great fun. * “Master of the Delta”:amazon by Thomas H. Cook. Small town secrets and class differences get out of control. Also an exploration of the nuances of evil. Quite good though the author explicitly foreshadows too often – it is obvious early on that some story threads are going to collide, the author doesn’t need to keep hinting. But I am nitpicking, a good story. * “The Good Thief”:amazon by Hannah Tinti. I gave this book a long time. But ultimately I gave up, there was no reward. Seems like a retelling of Oliver Twist and I never liked the original. And if you want to read Dickens, go read Dickents. Maybe it is just the fact that Dickens was forced on me in high school that I am reacting to.</p>

  <li>“The prospect of hundreds of billions of newly minted dollars coursing through the global financial system caused currency traders to thrash the greenback by almost 3%.”</li>
  <li>” The Fed is “now bringing out all the ammo in its arsenal”, according to Rosenberg.”</li>
  <li>“And, for those who think the time is ripe for upping their equity allocations, Mr. Rosenberg would like to remind them of what happened to buyers of the Nikkei 225 after Quantitative Easing was tried in Japan. Longs were treated to a 20% rally that lasted six weeks before stocks set new lows just four months later. Ultimately, predicts Rosenberg, QE helps bond buyers more than stock buyers.”</li>
  <li>“But since I doubt dollar holders will sit idly by as the paper they hold shrinks in value, I see a quick and happy resolution as being a low probability event. Then again, other central banks (the BOE &amp; SNB) are engaging in the same currency-busting policies, so it’s not altogether clear whether the world’s fiat currency system can survive a war of attrition.”</li>
  <li>“We’ve arrived at this unfortunate juncture in our nation’s financial history because of reckless behavior in both New York and Washington D.C.”</li>
  <li>“Let us all hope the U.S. experiment with pushing the button on Quantitative Easing is more successful for us than it was for the Japanese. But given all the behavior that brought us to this point, we will need to be both lucky and good from this point forward.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Hard to feel good about nearterm prospects for anything. Betting on volatility seems to be the smartest thing. Holding any asset seems risky.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">12 March 2009</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I like the all-you-can-eat economics of my Zune player, it has allowed me to try a lot of music that I would not otherwise have heard. A problem for me tho is – I do most my music consumption in the car while driving. I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zune-H9A-00001-Car-Pack-v2/dp/B000VWOKRG/ref=pd_cp_e_0?pf_rd_p=413863501&amp;pf_rd_s=center-41&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B000IXLHM4&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1GPDA9767NNP9PKC0G4G">Zune car pack</a> and it is fine for what it is – an FM transmitter. But I hate the experience – dynamic range compression (and this seems to be a particularly bad unit for that), difficulty in finding an unallocated slot in an urban area, interference, etc.</p>

<p>I wish my car had an AUX in jack but alas that slot is already consumed by an <a href="http://www.audiusa.com/audi/us/en2/experience/technology/ipod_preparation.html">iPod interface</a> which works great but of course is unusable by the Zune. Some guys <a href="http://www.neocaraudio.com/">claim they are building an adapter</a> but nothing exists. And I don’t have the time to hack one up myself.</p>

<p>So the other alternative is to somehow get Zune songs into MP3 format so that they can be on my iPod or burned on data CDs and thence playable in the car. I don’t really care about stripping off DRM, I want to be legal, but I want to listen to the songs easily in the car with greater fidelity than the FM path allows.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying <a href="http://tunebite.com/en/audio_video_drm_copy_protection/index.html">TuneBite</a> which as I understand it, pretends to be a sound card, captures a playback, and encodes into MP3 using LAME. It also grabs all the tags from the source song and whacks them onto the MP3. It works but is funky. Very sensitive to task load on the PC, any other task will interfere with the encoding. And it just misses some songs from my collection for some reason.</p>

<p>I’d prefer a less Rube-Goldbergian software solution, but for now this is kind of working.</p>
