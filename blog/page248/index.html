			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>Where are the young programmers?</strong> Tong and I were just talking yesterday, asking ourselves “Where are all the young programmers?”. When we were starting out, it was cheap/easy to write Mac and DOS apps – programming tools were available for &lt;$100, the machines were readily available. Nowadays if you want to target Windows, tools are more expensive, or you have to bury yourself in .Net which is an overwhelming amount of stuff to learn (and is quite expensive). The Java platform has been hijacked by IBM and turned into a corporate thing, it is also expensive (time and costwise) to embrace.</p>

<p>So if you are a young poor geek these days, what do you cut your teeth on? Building your own blog/website is surely one answer. Cheap to get started, tools are cheap too. Game Mods are another vibrant community. Skin development for Windows, Winamp, etc. is another hotbed. What is the growth path for these developers? What are they going to do in their late 20s, in their 30s? They aren’t really on a path to become .Net developers or EJB developers. What platform is going to grow up with them? They don’t want to use “their father’s platform”.</p>

<p>We don’t know but we are fascinated by the issue. (BTW, my own programming start was an Apple II disk/hex editor. I was driven to get all the strings off my <a href="http://www.wizardry8.com/">Wizardry</a> floppy so I could solve a puzzle that was holding me up in the game.)</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>Rats</strong>. One of my Halloween displays will be a cage of rats. The cage door will rattle every once in a while and a little burst of fog will come out of the central den. There will be a sign above the den – “Ben” – referring back to the movie Willard I saw as a kid. Amazingly I find they are doing a <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;cf=prev&amp;id=1808406589&amp;intl=us">remake of Willard</a>. I still remember the night I saw it first – at a drive-in – a triple feature – I forget the first show – then came Willard – followed by some creepy Dr Phibes movie. My sister and I were wrapped up in blankets in the back of the station wagon watching. I am pretty sure I fell asleep part way thru Willard. But it obviously left an impression on me, I remember the night well. Drive-ins are a lost treasure.</p>

<p>Anyway back to the display. I’ll have a creepy squealing sound coming from the cage too. I tried various rodent squeals but they are too high pitched to be creepy and loud – all the energy gets dissipated as high frequency, not enough volume or rumble. A pig squeal comes out great tho.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">30 September 2002</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace</strong>. Finally read <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/pcipb/">this</a> over the weekend. One glaring hole I saw was the lack of treatment of vendors of cyberspace equipment as a class separate from enterprises/businesses.</p>

<p>A motivating example: I have, on my Windows XP system, software and hardware created by the following vendors: Microsoft Corp, Award Software, Intel, ATI, Creative, Voxware, DSP Group, Sipro Lab Telecom, Fraunhofer Institut, Radius, Toshiba, HP, Buslogic, SCM Microsystems, Lotus, Adobe, AOL, Macromedia. These are just the vendors I could identify. This is just the software and hardware that comes on the PC as I bought it.</p>

<p>Additionally I have installed software (sometimes downloaded, sometimes purchased at retail) from the following vendors: Microsoft, Symantec, PersonalBrain, Xteq, Panterasoft, Lavasoft, RIM, Caesius, tamosoft, EasyDesk, Macromedia, Paramind, Apple, Dummysoftware, Winzip. Alkonost, Izymail, Groove. And probably two dozen more that I have uninstalled and no longer have a memory of.</p>

<p>In each of these cases, the corporations that created the software may or may not be located in the US, and if outside the US, may be located in countries whose interests are not aligned with those of the US. Even if located in the US, the companies may very well use foreign development offices, or may subcontract development to organizations located in other countries..</p>

<p>How are we insuring that all this software and hardware is performing the functions they are intended to perform, and don?t include some functionality hidden away to be accessed illicitly by some third party? Is there any inspection of this technology before it is made available in our markets? Who is doing the inspecting, do they have adequate access to source code and source design documents? Once inspected, how do we know that changes aren?t made by vendors ? is there any digital signing of executable content to permit detection of changes later?</p>

<p>There are a ton of issues here. Not at all sure what I think the right strategy is. But this is a hole you can drive a truck through.</p>
