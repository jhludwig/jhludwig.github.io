    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43256597-night-boat-to-tangier">Night Boat to Tangier</a> by Kevin Barry. Another great novel by Barry, two men’s lives explored over the course of an evening, great characters and dialog.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48654.Story">Story</a> by Robert McKee. I have no intention of ever writing a screenplay, but this book is highly useful for anyone who needs to communicate ideas – really forces you to think about your story and how to structure it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38322550-the-last-emperox">The Last Emperox</a> by John Scalzi. The first book in this series was interesting, and this closing was satisfying but not particularly memorable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9178059-shakedown">Shakedown</a> by Steven Malanga. There may be some good points in here, but the author doesn’t really help himself get his point out. One, he doesn’t really articulate what his goals are besides railing at unions and the new left. I know he hates union influence in education but I don’t really know what he wants to do about education. Two, he brings out a lot of data in anecdotal form, but never gives the overall context. I don’t know how upset to be about a certain number unless I understand overall spending, what a successful budget looks like, some success examples, etc. Three, he loves to use pejorative words like like “corpulent” and “porcine” and “lavish” and “stratospheric” in place of data, and that is just off-putting – as if he knows he can’t make his case rationally, so he is trying to inflame instead. And anyone who uses these words to describe teacher compensation seems a little disconnected from reality – I don’t know a lot of teachers celebrating their outrageous economic good fortune.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14662.The_Red_and_the_Black">The Red and the Black</a> by Stendhal. Time travel! Reading a book written in 1830 gives you a little view back into that world. Some archaic wording but human nature hasn’t changed, and the book structure seems almost modern.</li>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Tigner-ebook/dp/B07NXXYG1G">The Price of Time</a> by TIm Tigner. What a crappy suspense story. Poor characters, poor plot, just bad. I don’t know why I stuck with it, I am embarrassed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Transitions-Making-Sense-Lifes-Changes/dp/0738285404">Transitions</a> by William Bridges. Much to think about in this book. I have certainly not been thoughtful about the transitions in my life and it is near time to start thinking about the remaining transitions ahead of me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-D-D-Novel-ebook/dp/B01M0HPHR6">The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O</a> by Neil Stephenson and Nicole Galland. Fun time travel historical novel. A trifle long.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical/dp/0307947904">Dark Money</a> by Jane Mayer. Good book but it will be hard to finish. I knew that the Koch’s and their ilk were amoral self-interested traitorous manipulative bas%#@ds but this really brings it home, it is hard to read. It is A-OK to have different views on issues in our society, but the way they have used their money to corrupt the system is sickening.</li>

  <h1><a href="/2020/06/28/books-i-have-recently-rediscovered-gould-hesse-chernow-hofstadter-burroughs-and-more.html">Books I have recently rediscovered -- Gould, Hesse, Chernow, Hofstadter, Burroughs, and more</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’m looking over a bookshelf that I haven’t looked at in a while and there are some books I really fondly remember there. (And also a lot of books I have no memory of.) I am reflecting on how I really want to spend my time reading — I want to read more of these impactful books, and probably read fewer of the ones that are basically junk food.</p>

<p>Some of the great titles that caught my eye:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sparrow-Novel-Book-ebook/dp/B000SEIFGO">The Sparrow</a> by Mary Doris Russell. What a great book exploring morals and culture and misunderstanding.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Party-Classic-Moncure-Pantheon/dp/0375706437">The Wild Party</a> by Joseph Moncure March. I am not deep into poetry but this is nothing but fun. I’ve read this several times.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fatal-Shore-epic-Australias-founding-ebook/dp/B006NKL884">The Fatal Shore</a> by Robert Hughes. Probably needs some updating but an unvarnished look at one aspect of the British empire.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mismeasure-Man-Revised-Expanded/dp/0393314251">The Mismeasure of Man</a> by Stephen Jay Gould. Everything by Gould is excellent, this may be among the most important.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Death-Liberal-England-1910-1914-ebook/dp/B075CMYJS6">The Strange Death of Liberal England</a> by George Dangerfield. A fascinating and literary history tale. The title alone makes this book 100x more interesting than most history books.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ron-Chernow/dp/0679438084">Titan</a> by Ron Chernow. Learned so much about the growth of Standard Oil, and all the good and bad along the way.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Tides-Tim-Powers-ebook/dp/B004LLII12">On Stranger Tides</a> by Tim Powers. Powers has written some powerfully entertaining stories, and never got the renown he deserved.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567">Godël, Escher, Bach</a> by Douglas R Hofstadter. I’d recommend this to everyone. Definitely a desert island read. UPDATE: a reader suggests this one has not aged well, I may crack it open again.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Education-Speculator-Victor-Niederhoffer/dp/0471249483">The Education of a Speculator</a> by Victor Niederhoffer. Gets mixed reviews but I think that is because people expect to learn investment secrets in here, which is not what this book is about. It is more about the human side of his life.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Screwtape-Letters-C-S-Lewis/dp/0060652934">The Screwtape Letters</a> by C. S. Lewis. Whether you are a Christian or not, this is incredibly insightful and engaging. I’ve read many times.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Princess-Mars-Edgar-Rice-Burroughs/dp/1949982998">A Princess of Mars</a> by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I am sure this has aged horribly and I should probably be embarrassed about this one. But as a kid, this was a great rollicking adventure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Bead-Game-Magister-Novel/dp/0312278497">The Glass Bead Game</a> by Herman Hesse. This hit me hard when I first read it, very introspective look at finding meaning and place in life.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d love to hear about books others have rediscovered…</p>

  <h1><a href="/2020/06/21/recent-books-upheaval-lamb-radical-markets.html">Recent Books -- Upheaval, Lamb, Radical Markets</a></h1><div class="content">
    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upheaval/dp/0141977787">Upheaval</a> by Jared Diamond. Not as breakthrough as his earlier work, but an engaging look at crises and how nations react to them. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Finland because I was so ignorant of Finnish history.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lamb-Gospel-According-Christs-Childhood/dp/0380813815">Lamb</a> by Christopher Moore. An irreverent modern gospel, fun to read and still very true to the story and meaning of Christ. Will not be everyone’s cup of tea but I loved it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eric-Posner-ebook/dp/B07TP5HLWQ">Radical Markets</a> by Eric Posner and E. Glen Weyl. It promises radical ideas to improve the functioning of our markets and society. The first chapter was a little slow. In the second chapter they introduce their ideas for voting, and then offhandedly state that they have patented all this and have software you can buy. And I realize “Damn, this is a whitepaper for their business, and I paid for it.” Didn’t finish.</li>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clockwork-Dynasty-Daniel-H-Wilson-ebook/dp/B01LXFO711">The Clockwork Dynasty</a> by Daniel H. Wilson. Fun story about automatons who have been hiding within human society for eons, and their struggle to understand their own morality and purpose. I’m not sure it is a 4.5 star read but I was entertained.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Uncertainty-Decision-Making-Beyond-Numbers-ebook/dp/B07TJ1YW3Q">Radical Uncertainty</a> by John Kay and Mervyn King. A little academic but I still loved it. Our mania for models and planning is all for naught in a world swept by health care crises, climate crises, social crises, financial crises. We need to continually focus on what is going on underneath the numbers, and invest in resiliency to make it through the shifts and shocks. Good read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Economics-Times-Abhijit-Banerjee-ebook/dp/B07PCQLKSS">Good Economics for Hard Times</a> by Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo. Interesting discussions but not as foundational as Radical Uncertainty.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wow-No-Thank-You-Essays-ebook/dp/B07W3J49XM">wow, no thank you.</a> by Samantha Irby. The title is exactly the reaction I had, couldn’t finish. Just didn’t relate to anything in here, I may not be the target audience. It does have a cute bunny on the cover.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Don-Eyles-ebook/dp/B07L9YQ9WV/">Sunburst and Luminary</a> by Don Eyles. Fascinating story inside the Apollo program, great depth on the software and compute environment. Most people will find this book a little too in the software weeds but I enjoyed it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Tomorrow-Brendan-Mathews-ebook/dp/B01MT5299R">The World of Tomorrow</a> by Brendan Mathews. Great story of three brothers in New York in the years before WWII, all working their schemes. Great characters.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-to-Live-By-audiobook/dp/B01D24NAL6">Algorithms to Live By</a> by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. I wanted to like this book but it felt soulless. Ultimately I gave up, it didn’t seem to teach me anything I wanted to learn about human relations.</li>

    <p>Cleaning up the bookshelf during the pandemic – a little eclectic.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Least-Believe-Still-Christian-ebook/dp/B00AZ3W2IU">What’s the Least I Can Believe and Still Be a Christian</a> by Martin Thielen. I was raised Presbyterian but it didn’t really take. I still tho got a lot of value out of this book, particularly the first half which debunks some of the worst behaviours of some “Christians”. Recommended for believers and non-believers both.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Divine-Vol-Faust-Act-ebook/dp/B015X9BE8Y">The Wicked + The Divine</a> by Gillen, McKelvie, Wilson, Cowles. I try a graphic novel every so often and this got good reviews. Didn’t really catch my attention, jumped in midstream to the characters and I didn’t ever bond to any of them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock-ebook/dp/B00RKO6MS8">Super Forecasting</a> by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner. Great book about forecasting and leadership. The basic rules resonate across so many fields – be tangible; measure performance; iterate. Really nice work.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Planet-Adventure-Chasch-Servants-Dirdir/dp/0312854889">Planet of Adventure</a> by Jack Vance. If you like Burrough’s Mars books, then you will like this. I read the Burroughs books when I was very young, and they have not held up well, but I loved them as a kid. And I kind of love this tho again has not aged well.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201715953">Introduction to Econometrics</a> by James H. Stock, Mark W. Watson. On my shelves for 16 years, not sure why. An average intro to regression analysis.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-World-100-Objects-ebook/dp/B0052RCX0G/">A History of the World in 100 Objects</a> by Neil MacGregor. Much better than I anticipated, a very readable and visual walk thru the entire span of human history.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Math-Beauty-Physics-Astray-ebook/dp/B0763L6YR7">Lost in Math</a> by Sabine Hossenfelder.  Great book about biases in modern physics.  I am no physicist but the lessons apply to every other field.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Laurus-Eugene-Vodolazkin-ebook/dp/B014C57RDQ">Laurus</a> by Eugene Vodolazkin.  A sprawling tale of the life of a man searching for redemption in middle ages Russia.  Something in here for everyone.</li>

They may be criminals, but they have all the same economics and behaviours of commercial enterprises. Good insight into why attempting to eradicate narcotics at the source is such a waste of time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brown-Dog-Jim-Harrison-ebook/dp/B00CIWZ7LU">Brown Dog</a> by Jim Harrison.  Great character, great writing.  How has this never been turned in a tv series?  Fargo-style stories in the Upper Peninsula.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Recursion-Novel-Blake-Crouch-ebook/dp/B07HDSHP7N">Recursion</a> by Blake Crouch.  Nice time-travel romp, well reviewed.  I am not sure it quite lives up to the reviews but still a solid tale.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Underground-Airlines-Ben-H-Winters-ebook/dp/B017RQP41O">Underground Airlines</a> by Ben H. Winters.  A suspense story set in a world where the Civil War never happened and slavery continues to this day.  Tough topic, disturbing at times, good tale.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quicksand-Novel-Malin-Persson-Giolito-ebook/dp/B01GYPLREM">Quicksand</a> by Malin Perrson Giolito. Well reviewed but I couldn’t make it through, might be due to a weak translation.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-What-If-Were-Wrong/dp/0399184139">But What If We’re Wrong</a> by Chuck Klosterman.  Very thoughtful discussion of our conventional wisdom about culture, science, and other topics.  We are certainly wrong about many things we believe – how are we probably wrong, where is truth likely to be found, and does it matter?</li>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starless-Sea-Novel-Erin-Morgenstern-ebook/dp/B07MQPHKSL">The Starless Sea</a> by Erin Morgenstern. I am ambivalent. Certainly the story is creative, and much work was done to plot it out. But I am not really convinced the story went anywhere. I was compelled to finish but I don’t know I will remember much.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Have-Heard-True/dp/0525560378">What You Have Heard Is True</a> by Carolyn Forche. Brutal look at El Salvador during the Civil War in the 80s and 90s. Horrible. We have done so little in the US for our Central American neighbors, and actually have been behind so many terrible people.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daisy-Jones-Taylor-Jenkins-Reid-ebook/dp/B07DMZ5YR9">Daisy Jones &amp; The Six</a> by Taylor Jenkins Reid. I would not normally seek out a Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick but this was a great tale of rock and roll, drugs, sex, love, betrayal, forgiveness, redemption, consequences, responsibility. Tore through it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-State-Thriller-Chris-Hauty-ebook/dp/B07RPP4NN9">Deep State</a> by Chris Hauty. Embarrassed to say I read this – shoddy characters, shoddy dialog. But enthralling, couldn’t put it down, nice twists.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sunnyside-Glen-David-Gold/dp/0307454983">Sunnyside</a> by Glen David Gold. No idea why I bought this years ago. I like weird and this was too weird to finish.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2019/12/01/the-tesla-model-3-invaded-my-neighborhood---but-its-bigger-than-that-gm-president-mark-reuss-take-note/#392f053d172f">The Tesla Model 3 Invaded My Neighborhood — But It’s Bigger Than That (GM President Mark Reuss Take Note)</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Owning a good EV is a transformational experience. Is my Tesla as good in all respects as a traditional car? No. But it is so dramatically better in a few regards that I will never go back to an internal combustion engine vehicle. And I don’t think this is discernible in focus groups or other traditional market research vehicles.</p>

<p>I am reminded of 1988 when I joined Microsoft. I sat in meetings with senior leaders from DEC who regularly pooh-poohed the PC. And they were “right”, the PC was primitive and incomplete. And in 10 years DEC was gone as an independent entity, despite their amazing technical and business strengths, despite being “right” in their judgement about the PC.</p>

<p>When the tide comes in, you don’t want to be trying to fight it.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2019/10/07/strategy-formulation-is-not-optional.html">Strategy formulation is not optional</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>We get to spend two days with strategy consultants this week. I spent the first four years of my career as a strategy consultant and I have some perspective.</p>

<p>Strategy is not some task you do every once in a while as executives. Strategy formulation, implementation, testing, and revision is a daily, hourly task. The best operators in the company are deeply involved in it. Sales people are pitching your strategy, and getting data back from customers on acceptance, pricing, competitive alternatives, and unmet needs. Product people are implementing, identifying unexpected hurdles, and finding new innovations every day. Everyone is trying out competitive products, seeing competitive moves, every day.</p>

<p>Every day all this info needs to be processed by the org, and the strategy needs to adapt. Strategy formulation and reformulation is thus totally intermingled with operations, and the best orgs are incredibly nimble at incorporating all the daily data and evolving strategy.</p>

<p>Strategies created outside the operating team often fail because they are not realistic – they are not implementable, they don’t account for what is really happening in the technology or with the customers, they are uninformed by the daily competitive pressure the operating team faces. And the operating teams knows all this, and so doesn’t buy into the strategy.</p>

<p>While I was a strategy consultant, I was presenting some brilliantly conceived strategy to one of our senior partners, Tom. Tom had been in the consulting business a long time and had seen a jillion businesses. He listened to my presentation, and then said “this is all nice, but your strategy is what you ship”.</p>

<p>It was an aha moment for me that has stuck with me ever since.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2019/09/15/tesla-v10-is-coming-how-will-carmakers-respond.html">Tesla V10 is coming -- how will carmakers respond?</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Tesla is just kicking ass in car apps — <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/09/15/tesla-v10-first-look-release-notes-features/">https://electrek.co/2019/09/15/tesla-v10-first-look-release-notes-features/</a>.   They made an investment in a UX and data architecture and it is paying off.  Most carmakers are targeting where Tesla was 18-24 months ago, and by the time their cars ship, they will be even further behind.  </p>

<p>The carmakers have some options, none of which are easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embrace the phone.  Support Android Auto and CarPlay, give up on competing on base car UX and apps, and build auto-specific features and services on top of Android Auto and CarPlay.  This is not a terrible strategy, carmakers can focus their energy on car-specific features.  Xevo works with a number of carmakers on upcoming solutions along these lines, these will be good experiences.</li>
  <li>Try to drag race Tesla.  Some carmakers are trying this, it will be difficult to win this drag race if the carmaker is not tapping into software development talent in one of the software development centers — Bay Area, Seattle, NYC.  Xevo works with a couple of OEMs on this basis, tapping into the great Seattle ecosystem and labor market.  This is a tough strategy though and maybe the highest risk strategy.</li>
  <li>Leapfrog Tesla.  Open up the car UX and car data to a full software ecosystem.  Get 10,000 companies targeting the vehicles.  Carmakers are historically resistant to this, wanting to hold onto all aspects of car UX and car data, but just as the industry transitioned from feature phones to smartphones, the industry will make a transition to a more open car software ecosystem, and benefits will accrue to those who lead the transition.  Xevo also works with OEMs on this basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>These strategies are not mutually exclusive — every carmaker has many nameplates, model years, and regions — they have a lot of at bats, and can try out variants of these strategies, and learn from each trial.  The key thing is to set a reach goal for the software ecosystem in the car, and get moving aggressively on some of these strategies.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2019/07/30/car-software-is-hard-so-why-do-we-do-it.html">Car software is hard, so why do we do it?</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Writing software for cars is hard. Processors are generations behind mobile phones. Compute/network platforms are byzantine and fractured within/across OEMs. OS environments/toolchains are clunky/archaic. Internet connectivity is unavailable, intermittent, and costly.</p>

<p>Long OEM production cycles are fundamentally inconsistent with modern agile software cycles. OEMs aren’t excited about having more software. Security requirements are tough, durability/reliability requirements are tougher. There are substantial regulatory issues.</p>

<p>Nothing is easy, every line of code we ship seems to take a herculean effort. So why do we do it? There certainly must be easier hills to climb.</p>

<p>Well, cars are iconic products in our society. We use them every day, we spend an incredible amount of time in them. Our friends and family all use them, and when we do something right in them, everyone we care about will notice.</p>

<p>And there is plenty of room to do better. The user experience for software and services is not good today. With a very few exceptions, people don’t like their in-car experience.</p>

<p>We are in the “feature phone” period of car UX; Xevo and other companies working to open up the car software and data platforms to 1000s of apps, and open up the environment to the kind of continuous iteration that has driven advances in mobile and cloud software.</p>

<p>And the opportunity for innovation and learning is great. We are working on deeply interesting UX problems and distributed processing problems that are unique to the automotive space today, but have very broad applicability.</p>

<p>Figuring out how to do engaging distraction-free apps, how to partition processing across widely-distributed networks of untrusted vehicles, how to monetize data while protecting privacy – these are all interesting and fascinating and are being driven by the automotive environment.</p>

<p>And that is what attracts us – the chance to make big changes in the auto experience, the chance to learn and work on great problems, the chance to work with great like-minded people. If you know of anyone who might be excited about the challenges, please introduce them!</p>
