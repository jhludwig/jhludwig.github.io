				<p><p>Well it has been a while since I have posted any observations.  I have improved my pickleball game tho.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>Several years ago, I reconsidered my use of Facebook, and made the decision to largely exit Facebook, and I haven’t really regretted it.  I’ve been doing the same recently for Twitter.</p>

<p>I do get value out of Twitter.  College football smack talk and news, a little bit of community news, some technology info, the occasional news about friends.  But there is a lot of noise on Twitter, a lot of snark, a lot of “performative nonsense”, and maybe it is getting worse.</p>

<p>What should I expect out of Twitter?  Twitter is not some mystical thing.  It’s not our global conciousness, not our townsquare, not some magic public good.  It’s just a company trying to turn a buck by attracting eyeballs.  Viewing it as some special thing just leads to disappointment.</p>

<p>Twitter has every right to publish/promote whatever content using whatever criteria it wants.  The choice may attract or drive away some users, may attract advertisers or not, may have other business implications.  Whatever, that is the Twitter’s first amendment right.</p>

<p>Twitter also doesn’t owe me or anyone a bullhorn.  It may or may not let me say what I want to say, Twitter may or may not amplify it.  That is Twitter’s right.   And I have the right to use or not use Twitter.</p>

<p>Any new owner of Twitter will have the right to publish and promote whatever content they want, using whatever criteria they want.   It may be different than what the former owners did.  It may have different appeal to different users, advertisers, partners.</p>

<p>If I don’t like any of that, I can walk away at anytime.  No one is forcing me to use Twitter.  I can live without it — most of my family doesn’t regularly use Twitter, most of them don’t even have accounts.   Twitter doesn’t have particularly significant impacts on my work performance or on my relationships.  If and when it loses the entertainment, social, and educational value it has, I will just walk away.   There are plenty of places to read, to learn, to share, to connect.</p>

<p>This week, Instead of cruising Twitter every morning and worrying about what it might become, I’ve been spending time on <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">Duolingo</a>, trying to relearn my high school Spanish.  I feel better after doing this than I have ever felt after spending time on Twitter.  I will probably continue to drift away from Twitter towards more learning, thinking, and positive communication venues.</p>

<h2 id="progressive-buyers-guide">Progressive Buyer’s Guide</h2>

<p>I like the Progressive Voter’s Guide (<a href="https://progressivevotersguide.com">https://progressivevotersguide.com</a>).  It is not my sole source of voting info, but it is a very helpful and concise guide.</p>

<p>I also like the sustainable seafood guide (<a href="https://oceana.org/living-blue-sustainable-seafood-guide/">https://oceana.org/living-blue-sustainable-seafood-guide/</a>).  When I have useful info on products and their impact, I like to make the most beneficial choice.</p>

<p>I wish I had a Progressive Buyer’s Guide.  When I go to buy a car, or book a trip, or buy an appliance, or subscribe to a service, or whatever — where is that money going?  What political efforts are supported by that company or by its principals?  What states are benefiting most from my expenditure?  Do I have alternatives available that would direct money towards more progressive states or more progressive political efforts?</p>

<p>For instance, I found out this year that, not only had ATT and ATT executives donated to Republican candidates, but ATT helped to fund the establishment of the right wing OAN news network.  I don’t need to fund that.  I happily made the switch to T-Mobile.</p>

<p>Some elements I would want as part of an effort to build a progressive buyer’s guide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A system to track a product’s source by state, company.  What % of this car is produced in what state (or finer grained region) by what company?  I’d want to support community involvement, ultimately will want to tap a network of people providing this info.</li>
  <li>A system to track a company’s donations and the donations of executives.  Most of this is already public at the FEC website or Opensecrets.</li>
  <li>A progressive weighting of states, politicians, PACs, etc, and an algorithm to sum those into a total weighting for a product.  It is likely that one would want to support multiple ratings — IE a total progressive rating, a climate change rating, an income inequality rating, etc.</li>
  <li>A front end to display a weighting for a product.  And for a given product, show the more progressive alternatives.  You want a certain suv?   This alternative has more content produced in more progressive states, and the execs give less to retrogressive candidates.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="random">Random</h2>

<p><a href="https://steampipe.io">Steampipe.io</a> – a sql interface on top of all kinds of cloud resources.  Kind of cool.  As Sam says, software engineers love grand unification schemes.</p>

<p>In this era of heightened political conflict, why are the US Senators from the state of Washington so nearly invisbile?</p>

<p>I do not like pickles.  But I have great admiration for the pickle lobby who have somehow convinced everyone to put pickles with every sandwich ever.</p>

<p>One of the cryptocurrency luminaries — <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1307029562321231873?s=21&amp;t=dLhUbUOCawQ0lxu-uGogng">“Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom”</a>.  I have sometimes handwaved in some presentations, but I am a handwaving amateur.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087-seveneves">Seveneves</a> by Neal Stephenson.  A ton of interesting ideas.  A long book.  Maybe spend more of this length really digging into some characters and society and the impact of the ideas on both?</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27036577-the-war-on-cops">The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe</a> by Heather MacDonald.  The premise of this book is that our police are under attack by largely black activists which makes us all less safe as it leads to more crime.   The book explores both police activity and the limits activists seek, as well as incarceration and the limits activists seek.  The book fails completely for multiple reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>It is not a serious attempt to inform or influence.  No citations, no raw data.  False strawmen, ad hominem arguments.  Inflamatory language.  The book is designed to trigger emotional responses, not rational discussion.</li>
      <li>The causes of crime are way upstream from policing or incarceration and the author doesn’t dig into any of that.</li>
      <li>The author conflates race and culture and economics and muddies the waters.</li>
    </ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27036577-the-war-on-cops">The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe</a> by Heather MacDonald.  The premise of this book is that our police are under attack by largely black activists which makes us all less safe as it leads to more crime.   The book explores both police activity and the limits activists seek, as well as incarceration and the limits activists seek.  The book fails completely for multiple reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>It is not a serious attempt to inform or influence.  No citations, no raw data.  False strawmen, ad hominem arguments.  Inflamatory language.  The book is designed to trigger emotional responses, not rational discussion.</li>
      <li>The causes of crime are way upstream from policing or incarceration and the author doesn’t dig into any of that.</li>
      <li>The author conflates race and culture and economics and muddies the waters.</li>

The entire internet is compromised and we better get cracking to fix it.  Our software and internet industries were created by optimists and enthusiasts, but increasingly are inhabited by bad actors.</li>
</ul>

<p>A thread across both these books – it is a great strength of our free market economy that we allow new companies to easily create new offerings and enter the market – but we don’t have great mechanisms for assigning responsibility for the societal problems they may create.  The innovators get rich and move on, society is left with the huge costs of opioid addictions or the huge costs of easily hackable software systems.  The innovators should bear more responsibility, but this is a hard problem to fix.</p>

<p>After these two books, I needed some lighter fare:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32109569-we-are-legion-we-are-bob">We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</a> by Dennis E. Taylor.  A lighthearted tale of galaxy exploration by an idiosyncratic post-human AI and its clones.  There are many more books in the series and I enjoyed, but probably won’t continue as I have too many other books on the pile:</li>
</ul>

<p>And then a transition back to more serious fare:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8247140-factory-girls">Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China</a> by Leslie T. Chang.  Deep dive into the lives of migrant workers in modern China.  A real “wild wild west” economic scene, inside of a very traditional hierarchical society.  Interesting.</li>

				<p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life">Dare Obasanjo</a> has a <a href="https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1483073446045118464?s=20">nice post with a simple framework for evaluating job alternatives</a>.</p>

<p>It led me to reflect on my own job selection logic.  When I started my career back in the 80s, I was working in the Midwest, and it was a time of industrial restructuring and downsizing.  Layoffs were unfortunately common.  A very smart colleague at Booz-Allen, Bert Jones (who I have lost contact with), shared these simple ideas with me.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid layoffs, you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>work in the most important business (or businesses) to the company.  This means learning to read company financials and really understanding where revenues, margins, and growth comes from.</li>
  <li>and in that business, have a job either making things or selling things.  Every other job is subject to downsizing.  But if you are making or selling the most important things to the company, you are pretty safe.</li>
</ul>

<p>These points were useful more generally throughout my career.  Even when I was at Microsoft during a period of heady growth, and layoffs were not a threat, these factors impacted directly how much support I received – the closer I was to the core Windows (or Office) businesses, the more support I received, and the more opportunities I had to have an impact.</p>

<p>Of course, this also put me closer to the maelstrom, with greater focus on my performance, and that is not always the right fit, but I enjoyed it at the time.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>As an antidote to the web3 nonsense, I’ve been trying to play around with some more interesting and more fundamental innovations.  <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas">Microsoft has a really nice quantum computing tutorial</a> that I have been working my way thru.  I have enough math, quantum, electonic, and cs background to wade through.  You probably want to be reasonably comfortable with vectors and imaginary numbers or it might be frustrating.</p>

<p>I have a general impression, which is that it is very very very early in the development of quantum computing.  And that there is probably not much interesting software work to do right now.</p>

<p>Looking at the history of digital computing, we had to invent a lot of layers of technology to get to the point where it was a mass market useful thing.  We had to invent the transistor (and triode before that).  We had to combine resistors into circuits to make logic gates, coming up with some conventions that a certain voltage/current value was a “1” and another value was a “0”.  We had to invent Boolean algrebra.  We had to combine gates into higher order components like adders.  We had to move from discrete transistors to integrated circuits.  We had to develop Von Neumann machines.  We had to get to a standard system architecture of clocked cpus with memory.  We had to develop assembly language and then higher order languages like Fortran. And we had to develop a lot of tools and process technology all along the way.  All this work overlapped and moved in fits and starts, but took decades to wrangle all this together.  By the time we got to Fortran, we could write code that many humans could understand and which you could express real world problems in.</p>

<p>Without all this, writing “software” for transistors would have been terribly hard.</p>

<p>With quantum computing, we are throwing out the transistor and starting back up the stack.  We are establishing conventions for what the equivalent of a “1” and “0” is.  But the stack above that is still early or nonexistent.  We are nowhere close to a development platform that lets a lot of humans write code that is understandable and relates to a large body of real world problems.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sammck">Sam</a> pointed me to <a href="https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/quantum-computing-qubits-error-correction-no-cloning-theorem/#:~:text=Researchers%20estimate%20that%20a%20quantum,we%20can%20control%20the%20qubits">this article that says useful quantum computers may require a few million qubits</a>, and we are toying around today with systems of ~10-100 qubits.  Feels about right.</p>

<p>I am optimistic about quantum computing – today’s transistors require us to fling around a huge amount of electrons to do anything useful.  If we can get to circuit elements that can work with discrete quanta, man that will be a lot of computing performance.  But it is going to take us a while.</p>

I have enough math, quantum, electonic, and cs background to wade through.  You probably want to be reasonably comfortable with vectors and imaginary numbers or it might be frustrating.</p>

				<p><p>I read a lot of books this year.  There were some really good ones, and I couldn’t get down to a list of just 5 ala <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Holiday-Books-2021">Bill Gates</a>.  I have 10 I would recommend.  I was mostly drawn to nonfiction about macroeconomics this year, trying to get smarter about what is really happening in the world as we seem to enter a new era of money management.   I was also drawn to some great escapist adventure stories, because well the real world has been challenging.</p>

<h3 id="economics-and-society">Economics and Society</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49644992-the-price-of-peace">The Price of Peace: Money, Democracy, and the Life of John Maynard Keynes</a> was excellent, a great telling of the factors that influenced Keynes.  I was ignorant about him and never realized how committed he was to social reform and delivering economic benefits to everyone.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44525996-escape-from-rome">Escape from Rome: The Failure of Empire and the Road to Prosperity</a> argues that the collapse of Rome gave rise to the diverse competitive structure of the West that made it so successful, and seems relevant today. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/408549.Savage_Peace">Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919</a> is an interesting look at a time period when American democracy was under great stress from pandemics and factionalism, certainly lessons for today.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385639.Secrecy">Secrecy: The American Experience</a> is something I should have read long ago, the rise of government secrecy over the last century is not good for us.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358538-a-libertarian-walks-into-a-bear">A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear: The Utopian Plot to Liberate an American Town (And Some Bears)</a> is a hilarious tale illustrating the failures of extreme libertarianism.</p>

<h3 id="adventure-and-mystery">Adventure and Mystery</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175828.Iron_Lake">Iron Lake</a> is a great mystery set in Northern Minnesota.  It was easy to imagine being there and the characters were excellent, I am very late to this book and author.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55077697-the-blacktongue-thief">The Blacktongue Thief</a> is the start of a great new series, reminded me of Fritz Leiber’s “Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser” books that I read as a kid.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360562.Sharpe_s_Rifles">Sharpe’s Rifles</a> is a book from the midpoint of this character’s series, a fun romp in the Napoleonic era.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</a> is a great space exploration and first contact tale.</p>

<h3 id="and-then-one-more">And then one more</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25584210-everything">Everything: A Book of Aphorisms</a> is a very nice compendium of wisdom.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18869043-quantum-computing-since-democritus">Quantum Computing since Democritus</a> by Scott Aaronson.  I broke my pick on this one a little, you need to be very comfortable with advanced CS and quantum theory and my brain is rusty on both.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/934378.I_Heard_You_Paint_Houses">I Heard You Paint Houses</a> by Charles Brandt.  Interesting background on the Jimmy Hoffa murder, such a big story earlier in my life.</li>
