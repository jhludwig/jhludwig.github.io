				<p><p>Many people have told their Steve Jobs stories this year on the 10th anniversary of his passing.  Mine is just a small story.</p>

<p>In about 1981, when I was a junior at The Ohio State University, I was trying to figure out what was next for me – job, graduate school, what kind of graduate school (business, EE).  I was fortunate to have a good family friend, Jim Dutton, who was CEO of a startup, Caere Corporation, out in Los Gatos.  He offered to host me on a tour of Silicon Valley to help me make up my mind.  Just the opportunity to fly to California and to visit Silicon Valley seemed like an amazing adventure to me.</p>

<p>I flew out and stayed with Jim, Joan, and his family.  I didn’t understand exactly how connected Jim was.  Over the next 3 days I was able to visit a lot of companies, and I got the chance to talk personally with Gene Amdahl at Amdahl Corp, Bob Noyce at Intel, and Steve Jobs at Apple.  They were all a little intimidating, but Steve especially so, he was intense and excited about his work.  He was in his full beard days.  He pressed me hard on why I was considering various paths.</p>

<p>I only realized later in life what a great gift this trip had been.  I thanked Jim a lot at the time but probably didn’t thank him enough.  And I never really appreciated the time that these people gave me until later.  They took time out of their busy days to meet some nobody kid from Ohio, that was incredibly nice.  I probably could have fought my way into a job at one of their companies at that time if I had been savvy enough, I might have missed a great adventure and a great financial windfall, but my career turned out ok.</p>

<p>Steve and these other leaders taught me that we always have the time to reach out and help people entering their careers, we always have the time to be helpful and gracious to young people.  I try to live up to that.</p>

<p><a href="https://jalopnik.com/i-asked-experts-why-carmakers-cant-just-transition-to-n-1847739665">Jalopnik</a> has the automaker-sympathetic view of the chip shortage; contrast with <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/09/17/chip-makers-carmakers-time-get-out-semiconductor-stone-age/">Gelsinger’s advice to get moving to new chip technologies</a>.  As noted in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/mark-liu-in-time-taiwan-and-china-tsmc-and-the-u-s">Stratechery</a>, “In the long run it is the car companies that will have to give in: there simply is no good economic reason for TSMC or anyone else to build new “old” fabs”.  There is no fighting this wave.</p>

<p>In the early days of Hotmail (and other web properties), the team addressed scale and reliability by buying ever more expensive Sun servers that were “enterprise grade”, hardened, reliable. This approach to web scale reliability finally gave way to new system architectures built on replicated and distributed designs running on commodity hardware.</p>

<p>Some equivalent transformation is going to need to take place in auto systems design. It is inevitable that during the production and operating life of a car, the chips available at reasonable price and volume will change.  How might this affect system design?  Chips will have to be encapsulated in pluggable modules that are easily testable, easily changeable.  It probably argues for consolidating chips into fewer places in the car, and increases the importance of software and hardware design for these systems.</p>

<p>Some automaker will figure this out (perhaps Tesla, Rivian, and others already have), and it will deliver them large economic and flexibility benefits.</p>

<h3 id="culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast">Culture Eats Strategy For Breakfast</h3>

<p>Good article in The Atlantic about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/how-boeing-lost-its-bearings/602188/">how Boeing destroyed its engineering culture</a>.  <a href="https://twitter.com/sammck">Sam</a> says this may be a maxim – “Every successful creative culture is eventually absorbed by bureaucrats” – call it McKelvie’s law.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to spend a lot of my career at Microsoft during a time when the management chain had developer background and fully supported developers.  Not that this meant the company was some tech-mad customer-aloof circus – everyone was pretty focused on market success, and were able to think clearly and creatively about technology.</p>

<h3 id="i-dont-get-web3-but-i-keep-trying">I Don’t Get Web3, But I Keep Trying</h3>

<p>I spend a bit of every week trying to wrap my head around NFTs, Crypto, Web3.  I totally get the desire to break content and services free from large corporate ownership.  Services like <a href="https://radicle.xyz">Radicle</a> and <a href="https://gitcoin.co">Gitcoin</a> seem interesting maybe (although I can’t find anyone using radicle).</p>

<p>But then I read <a href="https://twitter.com/rohit_jindal29/status/1445625922770505741?s=21">this twitter thread</a> and <a href="https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/">this article</a> by some very vocal proponents of web3.  These are not stupid people, so I am trying to understand their views, but I struggle with their language.</p>

<p>For instance: <strong>“NFTs give users the ability to own objects, which can be art, photos, code, music, text, game objects, credentials, governance rights, access passes, and whatever else people dream up next.”</strong></p>

<p>The NFT concept of ownership seems closest to the notion of owning a meal you purchased.  No one else can own that instance, tho the restauranteur retains the right to create and sell infinitely more instances.  My own purchased meal has utility to me, but over a long time I can’t really resell it or expect it to grow in value.</p>

<p>Or owning an NFT is like owning a copy of a music track.  I get value out if owning the track copy, but no one is ever going to pay me much for my specific copy of “Custard Pie” by Led Zeppelin, and Led Zeppelin retains the rights to sell as many copies of this track as they can, or create new and different versions.</p>

<p>This is very different than owning a unique piece of art or owning all the rights to some piece of code or to some piece of music.  Certainly someone could contractually commit to sell some deeper piece of ownership along with an NFT, but a token itself doesn’t magically solve this ownership issue, nor are tokens required to sell these rights.</p>

<p>Another instance: <strong>“Ethereum is a decentralized global computer that is owned and operated by its users.  Blockchains are special computers that anyone can access but no one owns.”</strong></p>

<p>The industry has a pretty good definition of what a “computer” is, and there is a giant economy of Intel instruction set and ARM instruction set computers and tools — chips, SOCs, cloud instances, vms, dev toolchains, management tools, virtualization tools, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>My puny brain has a hard time understanding how blockchain compares to what we normally call computers.  If I want to write some program that does some arbitrary task, how do I host that on a blockchain?  If a blockchain is just a special computer that can only do one special kind of task, how is that useful?</p>

<p>Or: <strong>“Ethereum is powered by a fungible token, ETH, which is used to incentivize the physical computers that underlie the system.”</strong></p>

<p>How does a token power anything?  Or incentivize physical computers?  You can’t incentivize code or semiconductors.</p>

<p>Words and definitions matter.  This breezy use of well understood terms does not help to build understanding.  It damages the arguments of the web3 proponents as it seems like they are trying to purposefully obfuscate.</p>

<h3 id="iot-and-wifi">IOT and WIFI</h3>

<p>Interesting that <a href="https://twitter.com/darianbjohnson/status/1446484074122649632?s=21">low cost wifi chipsets are emerging</a>, putting wifi at/near zigbee/zwave power budgets, if I understand the specs.  Suspect zigbee and zwave don’t survive this assault.</p>

<h3 id="random">Random</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.howardstern.com/news/2021/10/05/brandi-carlile-performs-an-elton-john-cover-and-one-of-her-new-hits-live-on-the-stern-show/?utm_source=nextdraft&amp;utm_medium=email">Brandi Carlile’s cover of Madman Across the Water</a> is awesome.  Of course Brandi’s cover of almost anything would be awesome.</p>

<p><a href="https://guzey.com/intelligence-killed-genius/">An argument agains the notion of general intelligence</a>.  Hear, hear.  I’ve met a ton of smart people and they are all uniquely smart in different ways.</p>

				<p><h3 id="building-a-smart-home-app">Building a smart home app</h3>

<p>I’ve spent some time over the last 3 months trying to build a smart home app.  I wanted to yoke together all the embedded technology in my home — lights, sensors, cameras, various controllers, etc — and do something entertaining and fun with them.  Most smart home apps are booooring — no one really wants to be the operations manager for their house.  I wanted to create something a lot more fun, using all the smart home gear, maybe something like an Escape Room kind of game.  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_thimble">Hide the Thimble</a>.</p>

<p>I largely failed.</p>

<p>The smart home space is a confusing welter of devices, oses, physical networks, protocols, apis, apps, services, very few of which work together.  Getting devices to talk to services, even from the same vendor, is arcane — don’t take only my word for it — <a href="https://twitter.com/matvelloso/status/1439997593707167753?s=21">Mat Velloso tried to do some simple home automation work and realized what a can of worms smart homes are</a>.  I have Google, Apple, Amazon, Lutron, Zigbee, Zwave, Philips, Samsung, and every other kind of device you can imagine.  I have tried many ways to hook them all together, having the most success with Hubitat.  I really wanted to create a programmable substrate that I could use for apps in the home.</p>

<p>I got to a limping instance of a game with some invaluable help from <a href="https://twitter.com/sammck">Sam</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladsa/">Vlad</a>.  But it all fell apart repeatedly.  The devices are unreliable, sometimes responding, sometimes not.  Networks and protocols are unreliable.  The object models for devices are wildly inconsistent, even within a single brand.  Heterogeneous networks are a mess of differing transaction models, discovery mechanisms, etc.  The various packages and libraries to program against smart home devices are not well supported, many have been abandoned or are stale.  Naming and discovery of devices is, well, not even primitive.</p>

<p>At this point, it is not worthwhile to keep on tinkering.  I’ve dumped most my gear into a box and into storage.  There is no viable targetable smart home market.  The PC software market and the mobile software market exploded because a high volume of homogenous (interconnected) targetable devices existed.  No such state exists in the smart home market.</p>

<h3 id="tools-for-iot-development">Tools for IOT Development</h3>

<p>I have also tried to move upstream a little and dig into the tools for IOT development.  I haven’t really found what I want there either. I’d like to write an app that I can easily move across different IOT devices.</p>

<p><a href="Https://www.platformio.org">Platformio</a> has some promise and they have a big VSCode plugin, they have certainly aggregated a lot of devices in their tools.  But they don’t really solve my problems.  Their tool early binds you to a specific hardware platform and libraries, this isn’t what I want.  And I had hoped that a great VSCode plugin would be appealing, but the plugin feels pretty heavy – a bunch of decorations added to VSCode, a whole new hierarchy.  And if you want to target RPIs, you have to run the whole dev environment on an RPI – yuck.</p>

<p>There are almost no RPI plugins for vscode which I find surprising.  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KingWampy.raspberrypi-sync">Raspberry Pi Sync</a> is just some lipstick on rsync (tho the developer’s name is KingWampy, have to like that).  There is no plugin for <a href="https://www.balena.io">Balena</a> tho Balena separately has a pretty nice onboarding experience in the browser which I will be digging into further.</p>

<p>Microsoft has a suite of extensions for <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-tools">AWS IOT</a> but they don’t seem to be actively maintained.</p>

<p>Overall the tool situation is not great — which is another comment on the market; with no volume targettable hardware, there just is not much point to great tools.</p>

<h3 id="auto-software">Auto Software</h3>

<p>I’ve previously written about the problems in auto software.  Not shocked to see <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/09/17/chip-makers-carmakers-time-get-out-semiconductor-stone-age/">the chip industry is frustrated with the auto industry as well</a> – “It just makes no economic or strategic sense,” said Gelsinger, who came to the auto show to convince carmakers they need to let go of the distant past. “Rather than spending billions on new ‘old’ fabs, let’s spend millions to help migrate designs to modern ones.”</p>

				<p><p>Yet another bull$&amp;!t medical bill.  Encapsulates how screwed up our health insurance system is, why the whole thing should be thrown in the trash.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Labcorp">Labcorp</a> charges almost $3K for some blood work, and <a href="https://twitter.com/premera">Premera</a> “negotiates away” $2.3K of this.  What nonsense.  Everyone is inflating costs for their own reasons and it is all abusive garbage.  I don’t believe for a second that these labs cost anywhere close to $3K and I don’t think Premera did any work at all to negotiate this down.</li>
  <li>Premera pays almost $500 for the labs (and who knows if they really did, all I have is their claim they did)</li>
  <li>We are stuck with $119.50 which is probably not far from the true cost of the labs, but why didn’t Premera “negotiate away” this when they were negotiating away $2.3K?</li>
  <li>Amount you saved – another total fiction.  Based on the nonsense total charge and Premera’s claims of what they paid.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all this, I have no power as consumer to do anything.  The insurers and providers are motivated to jack numbers up.  The system results in a lot of profits being diverted to insurance companies and administrative overhead that does nothing to benefit patients.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57935190-the-authoritarian-moment">The Authoritarian Moment: How the Left Weaponized America’s Institutions Against Dissent</a> by Ben Shapiro because one of the smartest readers I know recommended that I take a chance on it.  It is not my cup of tea but I tried to keep an open mind and be thoughtful about.</p>

<p>The question that I will pose to my friend is “what exactly did you find compelling in here” – I am very curious to know what resonated with him.</p>

<p>The book is not a serious book.  The author throws out anecdotes to fit his desired narrative, and uses bombast in place of data to sell his story.  He purposefully ignores anecdotes or data that don’t fit his story. I  don’t think the author is stupid, this is all intentional, he seeks to enflame and enrage people who already agree with him, not advance the dialog about issues.</p>

<p>He makes much of the term “ultracrepidarianism” — criticising left-leaning “experts” who opine outside their domain, while he opines outside his domain.  Consider the chapter on corporate behavior – Shapiro has not spent his career inside of corporations at the executive level – his analysis of how corporations operate is so off it is “not even wrong”.  There is certainly criticism to be leveled at corporations, but being agents of the authoritarian left is not one of them!  CEOs and boards are focused on the profits and quarterlies, execs are focused on their own careers and their own comp.  The revolving door between gov and industry to drive regulatory capture is a real thing and it is driven by $s, not by any authoritarian left motivation.  I am sure there are examples ocassionally of corporations acting in different ways, but it is not the norm or a significant theme.  I suspect the other chapters on media and entertainment are just as off, but I have less experience there.</p>

<p>Throughout the book Shapiro repeatedly comingles the behaviour of the progressive left and the behaviour of anti-Trumpists.  They are completely different motivations.  He claims that anti-Trumpists “hated Trump because they hated his supporters” and this is utter rubbish.  I know a lot of anti-Trumpists and they are pretty clearly focused on Trump and his coterie.</p>

<p>Shapiro repeatedly claims that conservative views are being stifled in society.  Given the ratings of Foxnews, and given his own status as a bestselling author and a media presence with a lot of reach (which he brags about), this just isn’t supported.  He and other conservatives seem to have plenty of ways to reach their audiences.  He just doesn’t like the fact that not everyone wants his message.</p>

<p>And that is the core point – much of the book seems like whining. People are judging him, people aren’t listening to him, boo hoo hoo.  In the last chapter, he quits being a whiney bucket, and talks about taking matters into his own hands, and creating media content and media platforms that are aligned with his politics.  And I say bravo, this is what he should do, and is free to do.  He and his allies should get their stories and views out in as compelling fashion as they can and find an audience.  May the best ideas carry the day.  He should work on more compelling ideas to bring forward, and spend less time on whining.</p>

				<p><h2 id="nfts"><strong>NFTs</strong></h2>

<p>I went down the NFT rabbit hole this week a little.  The whole NFT thing seems nutty to me, but there is a good chance that I am just old and my brain is inflexible.  So I decided to force myself to dip in.  I tried to buy an NFT.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR: A confusing welter of accounts and companies I had to deal with, a blizzard of expensive fees, my ETH ended up getting fractured across multiple wallets and intermediate locations, and i lost all my auctions to people who were willing to spend large amounts of ETH for ephemeral goods.  I am not much smarter about NFTs.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The first challenge: decide what NFT to buy</strong>.  NFTs cover nearly the entire gamut of human expression.  Opensea.io at the moment has 19M+ listed and that is only one marketplace.  Much of the activity is collectibles with designed scarcity.  I declined to chase these, I went after NFTs for more traditional art.  My thinking is that NFTs don’t really change human behaviour and human interests, and the same kind of things that have been deemed valuable and collectible for the past 1000 years will continue to be the things we value and collect.  All the regenerative collectibles seem a little risky to me, I can’t imagine that anyone will care about these in 15 years, just like no one really cares about beanie babies any more.  There are some categories of collectibles that have retained value — baseball cards, comics — I would imagine that NFT-based sports and comic collectables may also have some value, collectables that appeal to a large interest community existing outside the crypto space may be a smart play.  But I will stick to the more traditional arts for the moment.  I could be way off.</p>

<p>I also wanted a bit of a personal connection to the item.  We moved to Seattle at the beginning of the grunge wave, so I settled on this <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/24460042610638516058947371250238633898033226268786963695065259056137158787082?assetContractAddress=0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e&amp;tokenId=24460042610638516058947371250238633898033226268786963695065259056137158787082">photo sheet from the early days of Nirvana</a>. It was being offered on Opensea which seems to be the largest and most established market. I had never heard of Opensea before this adventure, but they are backed by big names so presumably someone has done some due diligence.</p>

<p><strong>Now to make a bid, I needed to have a crypto wallet</strong>, I don’t have one.  I do have some ETH held up at Coinbase, but that is not a wallet.  Opensea suggests a bunch of wallets from unknown organizations, I went with their recommended default of Fortmatic, a second company.  Fortmatic is backed by lesser names and with lesser dollars so no idea if I should really trust them, but damn it, I am going down this rabbit hole.</p>

<p><strong>Now in possession of a wallet, I need to get some crypto currency in it</strong>.  A bunch of new terms and organizations — I can provide <a href="https://weth.io/">WETH</a>, <a href="https://makerdao.com/en">DAI</a>, or <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a>.  DAI and USDC hold out the promise of just using a credit card to add some dollars, so I tried those to start.  I am handed off to Moonpay for payment processing, a company that I have never heard of, that there is little info about, and is based outside the US.  I have one sketchy LinkedIn connection to someone at Moonpay, I am not feeling great about this.  And I am blocked because they demand a residential billing address and not a PO Box, and all my credit cards go to a PO box.  </p>

<p>I work around this, and then Moonpay wants me to send them an image of my driver’s license so they can verify my identity.  I just want to buy a picture, guys.  I can buy real physical art with far less trouble.  I declined to go any further down the Moonpay path.</p>

<p>So I went back to the <a href="https://weth.io/">WETH</a> option.  I don’t have any WETH, I have ETH at Coinbase. WETH is some wrapping of ETH because ETH isn’t compatible with some standard.  So I decide i will transfer some ETH over to my Fortmatic wallet to be converted to WETH.  Except my Coinbase account isn’t enabled for transfers yet, and now Coinbase wants my driver’s license.  I crossed that bridge a long time ago, Coinbase needed my driver’s license at account opening time.  Why they need it again I don’t know, but what the hell.  </p>

<p>OK so now that my Coinbase account is working, i transfer some ETH to my Fortmatic wallet.  A blizzard of confirmations and fees and charges to move the ETH and to convert to WETH.  No idea what all this is, but it is not cheap.  Along the way i get introduced to <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a>, there sure are a lot of organizations riding on my transaction, grabbing their piece of the flow.  Each of these has slimmer backing in turn, and seems more risky – apparently I am now trusting part of my transaction to a company in Kuala Lumpur.  Nothing against Kuala Lumpur, it just seems like an incredibly convoluted chain.   </p>

<p><strong>Finally I complete my bid</strong>.  And now I wait.  The original creator minted 10, 9 have sold already, I have the high outstanding bid, I have no idea what happens now.  In the time it took me to set up all the above accounts and linkages, several of the items were sold, so I may have missed out.   In the meantime I downloaded the JPG of the image.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I got outbid on that first piece, and so I have moved onto another piece.  and somehow i have two identical bids on this new piece, super strange, the Opensea/Fortmatic experience seems buggy.  Oh and every bid or cancelled bid requires a crazy expensive fee.  What a twisty mess.</p>

<p><strong>Update II</strong>.  Outbid again.  For a crazy price on a simple photo.  There are people who are far freer with their money than I am.  I could buy a nice large format physical print for less than these prices.  </p>

<p><strong>Update III</strong>. And Opensea now reports that the 2nd item I bid on, actually sold two days earlier for a price below my bid and a number of other bids greater than mine. WTF, this sale transaction did not appear when I was bidding. This whole process seems mysterious and arbitrary.</p>

<p>The entire process has been very unsatisfying.  I don’t have the thing I want.  I am not even sure what I get if I win.  A lot of people took a bite of my transaction, and I bet that I get none of that back if I don’t win.  I am not even sure how I get my ETH back if I don’t win, it is now WETH in a fortmatic wallet.  I have had to trust a basket full of unknown organizations.  I have a whole bag of numbers now — wallets, transaction IDs, etc — that I feel like I need to hang onto.  </p>

<h2 id="nfts-part-ii"><strong>NFTs, Part II</strong></h2>

<p>Maybe I should focus on generating some NFT-able content instead.  <a href="https://aiartists.org/generative-art-design">Great list of generative art and assistive art tools here</a>.  In case you want to start making NFTs, or just dabble in creative arts.  Some of these are dead already but lots to explore.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visionist/id1071126584">Visionist</a> is a fun app for monkeying with photos.  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/silk-2-generative-art/id1050339928">Silk 2</a> is fun for creating generative art.  <a href="https://humbeatz.com/#/">Humbeatz</a> seems like it might have been fun but I am wary of an app that has not been updated in 3 years.</p>

<h2 id="real-world-art"><strong>Real World Art</strong></h2>

<p>For far less money than an ephemeral NFT, we purchased a great porcelain piece from <a href="https://www.lopezislandartists.com/marianna-haniger">Marianna Haniger</a> and a stone piece from <a href="https://www.lopezislandartists.com/bruce-richardson">Bruce Richardson</a> at the <strong>Lopez Island Artist’s Studio Tour</strong> this weekend.  Beautiful pieces, we supported local artists, some of their proceeds they are donating to local charities.  So much more satisfying than an NFT.  The Studio Tour is a great annual event.</p>

<p>Re NFTs, this <a href="https://twitter.com/activerecall/status/1434549134292176898">tweet</a> captures how I currently feel.</p>

<h2 id="contacts"><strong>Contacts</strong></h2>

<p>The contacts app is my least used and least favorite of the standard iOS apps.  It solves very few problems i have with people.  Out of my thousands of contacts, there are at most a couple hundred that are super important, and contacts does nothing to help me nurture and build those relationships. </p>

<p>When I was last managing a team, the contacts app wasn’t relevant at all.  It did nothing to keep me in touch with people on the team.</p>

<p>All my communications tools are message- or thread- or folder-or channel-centric, none of them are really people-centric, but that is what I want.  ios Messages does the best job, but only for message content — i can’t see the last 7 emails i sent to a contact, or add notes, or schedule a meeting, or see the last 3 times we met, …</p>

<p><a href="https://web.clay.earth/">clay.earth</a> seems interesting.  I really love the idea of a contact-centric app, where i can actively think about and monitor my engagement with people.  </p>

<h2 id="tools"><strong>Tools</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://untools.co/">Untools</a> is a repository of frameworks for helping you think about problems.  Super handy.  I kind of wish this was embodied in a “problem” app or “decision” app that would let you keep track of all the problems you are wrestling with, and let you easily try different frameworks out.  You can buy templates that you stick into Notion, a step towards an app.</p>

<p>I am not sure how I missed <a href="https://platformio.org/">Platform.io</a>.  I have largely given up on arduino-class devices because the toolchain is terrible.  This seems to address most of the terribleness, and expand to other devices.  I have thrown away most of my arduino-class hardware but maybe I need to retry.</p>

<h2 id="random"><strong>Random</strong></h2>

<p>Apparently <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/blog/does-risk-tolerance-change-through-the-week/">our tolerance for risk changes in a very predictable way during the week</a>.  Decisions on mondays and fridays may be more fraught.  If you know this, how do you change your week’s schedule and pace?  Are there a class of decisions for which you want to encourage greater risk taking, and a class for which you want to discourage risk taking?  Almost certainly so.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/landforce/status/1434543804921516034?s=21">good list of history books</a>.  Many of these are quite broad in scale, I also like histories that bear down on a development — <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1138543.The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=N3hPZwqHbj&amp;rank=1">The Strange Death of Liberal England</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1128055.Hitler_s_Thirty_Days_to_Power">Hitler’s Thirty Days to Power</a> are two of my favorites.</p>

<p>“Understanding is a poor substitute for convexity (antifragility)” — <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility">Taleb explains the strategy behind cultivating optionality</a> in business and in life, and how that can lead to outsized rewards.  I first encountered his explanation of this in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan">The Black Swan</a> and it has always resonated.  It is why software VC has been so successful – a portfolio of low capital cost trials can lead to great outcomes (and wow the trend is not slowing down – look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P5z7dWHUjQ">unicorn births this year</a>).  It is why well-run software companies can be so successful – again a portfolio of low capital cost bets, with active pruning and management, can lead to great outcomes.  I struggled and was unable to explain this dynamic to my last employer, they could not appreciate the value of creating and encouraging optionality in the business.  </p>

<p>“You don’t have to fix it all now. Just start by starting” — a <a href="https://twitter.com/natehowe/status/1431307397600055296?s=20">great thread</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/natehowe">Nate Howe</a> on digging into problems.  I especially love a couple of his conclusions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“An imperfect solution now is better than a perfect solution that will never happen.” — I have learned this over and over in my life.  I have seen a lot of time wasted trying to find the perfect solution when we could have very well implemented an OK solution and moved on. </li>
  <li>“Doing the thing is often less painful than thinking about doing the thing.” — Yes yes!   I almost always feel better just digging in and working on a problem, rather than letting it sit and fester on a todo list somewhere.  </li>
</ul>

<p>“Code is easy.  People are hard.” — I also enjoyed this <a href="https://review.firstround.com/the-chief-people-officer-as-pm:-rethinking-the-systems-and-tools-that-run-the-company?">article from the Credit Karma Chief People Officer</a> on how she does her job, approaching it as if she is the PM for the tools and systems in the company.  I wouldn’t follow all her practices (for instance, gamifying recognition, ugh), but I love the thoughtfulness and intentionality she brings to the role.</p>

<h2 id="technology"><strong>Technology</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/aug/0819-att.html">GM/ATT announce that select cars will have 5G in 2024</a>.  Only 3-5 years after you had it on your phone!  Car connectivity is completely f&amp;*ked up.  OEMs sign long term contracts that are uneconomic and don’t allow for the explosion of connectivity that people and apps want.  Personal phone data plans runs rings around car connectivity plans and will continue to do so.  OEMs need to open the car up and allow carriers to compete for connectivity, allow people to bring their own data plans, etc.  The current model just kneecaps the automotive software space.</p>

<p>I feel like such a dinosaur when I read about <a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a>.  I may just buy a few NFTs on Opensea.io to learn how it all works.  This <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">article digging into the definition and quantification of “legitimacy”</a> seems interesting.  And here is a <a href="https://dev.to/dabit3/the-new-creator-economy-daos-community-ownership-and-cryptoeconomics-lnl">good high level walk thru some of the current trends</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/towards-the-abolition-of-animal-farming">Tissue-culture meat</a> seems like an important development.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/nifty-corporates">Nice overview at Not Boring about emerging technologies</a>, I love the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-themes-surface-in-the-2021-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies/">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> chart. Ooh, NFTs may be at the “Peak of Inflated Expectations”.</p>

<h2 id="mentoring"><strong>Mentoring</strong></h2>

<p>I recently had a young college student (entering junior year) ask me for some career and schooling advice.  He is a CS major and interested in AI, tho he hasn’t done much in his classwork yet.  He really wants an internship in the space.  I am not sure I had the best advice but i gave him some counsel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get familiar with the AI frameworks getting a ton of investment from Microsoft, AWS, Google.  It is easy to spin up little experiments with these, and they are investing a ton of time in them.</li>
  <li>Get familiar with the data input and data management side of these frameworks.  That is where so many of the problems lie in actual use of AI</li>
  <li>Get comfortable with production software tool chains.  Source control, test frameworks, build systems, test flights, monitoring, etc.  You will need to be familiar with these in your career.</li>
  <li>Go to the websites of your top 5 internship candidates and read the info they have about interns, about past candidates.  Go to your career office at your college and see what interns they have hired and see what background those interns had.  Identify the gaps in your background, and make yourself into a compelling candidate.</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone has better counsel I would love to hear it.  I’d like to help this young person and others like him find success.</p>

<h2 id="tools"><strong>Tools</strong></h2>

<p>Finally installed <a href="https://textsniper.app/">textsniper</a>.  Should have done this long ago.  </p>

<p>github.dev is nice.  just press the . key while looking at a github.com repo.</p>

				<p><p>I’m cleaning some older books off the shelf, and peeking at them as I do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. 20+ years old, and a little dated in its examples (CORBA?) and quotes (a Bill Cosby quote?), but still a solid source of guidance on very basic software craftsmanship.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring">Refactoring</a> by Martin Fowler. Hasn’t aged as well. In a world of cloud services, asynch programming, containers, this just doesn’t seem to line up with the fault lines in modern software.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/685486.Patterns_of_Software">Patterns of Software</a> by Richard P. Gabriel. I wanted to like this, and I suspect there is some great stuff in here, but too abstract and meta for me</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete">Code Complete</a> by Steve McConnell. Back before Stack Overflow, Github, online notebooks, great doc sites, this may have been a great guide to software development. Still great topics, but doesn’t seem like the best way to learn.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then some new ones</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56686093-they-called-us-river-rats">They Called Us River Rats</a> by Macon Fry. A look at the settlements along the batture in the New Orleans area. What a way to live.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52379735-the-echo-wife">The Echo Wife</a> by Sarah Gailey. Nicely paced although the purportedly super smart protagonist didn’t seem to think that far ahead sometimes – if you are super good at cloning people and you need to cover up a death, I don’t think it would take you more than a nanosecond to consider cloning the dead person.</li>

				<p><h2 id="financial-literacy"><strong>Financial Literacy</strong></h2>

<p>From <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/hood/">Scott Galloway on Robinhood</a>: “…we need to arm ourselves, and particularly our young people, with financial literacy. Everyone should be fluent in the basics of markets and how to build financial security.”</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that we don’t really teach the basics of free markets and personal finance and capitalism.  I was fortunate to have parents and grandparents who shared some wisdom with me, and was fortunate to have stumbled into the right learning opportunities at college and in my early career.  We leave most people ill-equipped to deal with the caveat emptor markets we live in.  </p>

<p>I admire Hadi Partovi and what he has done with <a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> to make computer science education available universally.  I wonder if financial literacy needs a similar push, who the champion could be, what set of organizations would have to be involved. </p>

<h2 id="work-and-purpose"><strong>Work and Purpose</strong></h2>

<p>I met Hadi back during the IE3 days at Microsoft, he was part of the best team any of us had ever worked on.  He recently posted a thread about <a href="https://twitter.com/hadip/status/1426587396343099397">the 25th anniversary of the IE3 project</a> and what it meant to him.  And then he promptly got a raft of sh$t from the twitterverse about work-life balance, death marches, etc.   None of this feedback came from people who were on the ground as near as I can tell.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for everyone but here is my story.  At that time at Microsoft, I felt a great sense of purpose — “A PC on every desk and in every home” was empowering and exciting, it was relevant to the personal systems and nt and apps and consumer teams, everyone was pulling hard on the oar to make the PC a more useful device, and that included a great internet experience.  I was incredibly fortunate to be working during the PC wave, I was thrilled to be working on PC challenges.  </p>

<p>And I was thrilled to be worked with a set of like-minded great people — I learned so much from the chance to work with people at Microsoft in the late 80s and 90s, too many people to list here, but the IE team was chock full of great people and the management chain above me was great.  I worked hard and was happy to work hard.  I never had anyone tell me what hours I had to work, and I never told anyone what hours they had to work.</p>

<p>I am also a nerd.  And Microsoft bought me all the toys I wanted.  I had 3 computers on my desk, i rotated a new one in every 2-3 months, I was able to buy any software I wanted, I had a direct internet tap at my desk, I mean it was kind of nerd heaven.  </p>

<p>I didn’t work as hard as some people — I had two young kids at home, I tried to be home at dinner every night, I refused most travel.  That probably all limited my career but it was the tradeoff that worked for me.  No one ever gave me any negative feedback and all things considered, my career progressed just fine.  </p>

<p>The chance to work on a great mission, with great people, with all the toys I could imagine — I would have worked 48 hours a day if I could have.  I learned more, had more fun, and made lifelong friendships.  I suspect a lot of other people felt the same way.</p>

<h2 id="purpose-and-church-membership"><strong>Purpose and Church Membership</strong></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx">US continues the trend away from participation in organized religion</a>, with less than half of us now belonging to a church/synagoge/temple/mosque.  I am doubtful that human nature has changed dramatically, I suspect people are still seeking for meaning and purpose.  For some reason, church affiliation is no longer meeting that need.</p>

<p>I can’t say why this is happening as a trend, but I can share my story.  I grew up in a Presbyterian household and went to church and Sunday school a lot.  And Reverend Urquhart, our minister, was a thoughtful and compassionate leader — I enjoyed listening to him and I enjoyed the limited opportunities to talk directly with him.  I’ve met other senior leaders at churches since then, and some of them are the most thoughtful and interesting people I’ve ever met.</p>

<p>But … the rest of the church experience was not great.  Sunday school had all the cliques and bad behaviour of regular school, maybe worse, and I was not in the “cool” group.  Church services and rules were rigid.  The church community could be petty — you didn’t dare sit in the wrong pew, you had to wear the right clothes, etc.  The church had all the distasteful power dynamics of any human organization.  The church was insular — my hometown was racially and economically diverse, and I am sure had lots of problems, but you wouldn’t know it from my church community.  By the time I got to college age, I wanted nothing to do with the organized church.  </p>

<p>This is all relatively benign, but served to push me away from the church, and look for purpose elsewhere in life.</p>

<h2 id="random"><strong>Random</strong></h2>

<p>From <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/what-germany-can-teach-america-about-polarization/619582/">The Atlantic</a>, Germany has reduced polarization over decades with a healthy investment in public media.  In the US we have largely handed over all media to private entities, and well, we all know how that has been working out.  Maybe rather than trying to regulate private media or media/tech companies, we should reinvest in the public alternative.  We don’t need to shutter or control the private entities, let them flower and prosper. </p>

<p>Speaking of public media, this <a href="https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/">BBC library of sound effects</a> is pretty awesome, free for non-commercial use.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum/astronomy-photographer-year-2021-shortlist-images">Astronomy Photographer of the Year shortlist</a> – wow.  I aspire to do astrophotography some day.</p>

<p>I didn’t understand all the features of airtags, <a href="https://twitter.com/dguido/status/1424921645483966466?s=20">this thread was interesting</a>.  Now I know why my daughter complained about the airtag beeping in the van she borrowed from us.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51079278-the-next-great-migration">The Next Great Migration</a> by Sonia Shah.

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23422.The_Art_of_Travel">The Art of Travel</a> by Alain de Botton. A fascinating discussion of travel, of art, of perception.
