    <p>Good summary of this report – <a href="http://arnoharris.typepad.com/cleanenergyfuture/2008/02/greentechs-ppa.html" title="Clean Energy Future by Arno Harris: GreenTech's PPA Report -- Key Insight on Leased Buildings">Clean Energy Future by Arno Harris: GreenTech’s PPA Report – Key Insight on Leased Buildings</a>:</p>

<p>* In 2009, PPAs will be established as the standard way that American businesses pay for on-site green power, bringing solar to commercial rooftops of mainstream America with yearly additional growth of 30-50%. * In 2008 the clear majority of new commercial installations will be third-party managed, with 65-75% of the market. * In 2007, of the national commercial and institutional solar market, an estimated 50% was developed under PPAs, up from 10% in 2006. * The PPA segment has not only outstripped conventional commercial PV sales, it has also expanded the market — acquiring new customers that would not have purchased solar hardware. * PPA companies will continue to drive down costs with innovations across the entire value chain.</p>

    <p>OK this is starting to get really annoying. 70+ sync errors today with the iphone. seems to be mostly with recurring calendar events. grr. i know have my dad’s birthday on my calendar like 8 times.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Oh fricking great. 1548 sync conflicts reported. What the hell am I supposed to do with that????</p>

<p>UPDATE: Oh double great. Now the Conflict Resolver is trying to sync an iCal event with a contact. Awesome. And trying to resolve a conflict between my mom’s birthday and a basketball game – “Select the correct Event information below”</p>

    <p>* “The Ghost Brigades”:amazon by John scalzi. Ok most of the way thru, kind of “Forever War”:amazon -ish. The denouement is a little weak, a little too much falls into place. But solid story in a much more densely occupied galaxy than ours appears to be. * “Borden Chantry”:amazon by Louis L’Amour. Great tale, first L’Amour I’ve read. Classic American west hero. Politically incorrect in so many ways but well told. * “The Revolution Will Not Be Funded”:amazon. Given to me by a very smart left-leaning person, not something I would have ordinarily stumbled across, but I am glad I did. A collection of essays from authors with very different experiences and worldviews than mine – typically minority, typically low income. The basic theme is a criticism of 501c3 funding for charities: the structure prevents in many ways recipient organizations from attacking structural problems in society due to gift limits on political activity, reporting overhead, etc. There is a lot of needlessly pejorative anti-capitalism and anti-white talk which distracts from the message, and a lot of whining about the burdens of fundraising, and a lot of “revolution for revolution’s sake” talk. And only a few hints from some of the writers about proposed solutions. But still thought provoking – there are real problems in society that require policy solutions, not just amelioration. If you give a lot of money to charities, this is not a bad book to read as part of your overall education process.</p>
