It is fascinating that the release of a single game can cause so much angst, and as a user it is great to see these vendors trying to kill each other because I am going to get much faster video cards as a result.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Valve has released the new <a href="http://www.steampowered.com">Steam client</a> and the website is DOA, i assume it is getting hammered with traffic, so that is good for Valve.</p>

<p>Personally I think this is all good, we get back to music for the sake of music. The funding for all the other ancillary “value-add” activities around the music is just going to dry up. 100 years ago there was no recorded music industry – you went out and listened to artists if you wanted music.
