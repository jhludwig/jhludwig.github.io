<p>OK I screwed up a little bit on my move to MT3.2. My archive naming scheme changed because I blew away my old blog. And I exported and reimported all my entries. As a result I was left with a lot of old archive entries, expecting my old CSS, but getting my new CSS so they looked like crap. I forced a rebuild of all the old pages but because of the entry export/import, all my entry numbers were different.</p>

<p>As a result, search engines are now pointing to pages that look ok but have the wrong content. Sorry. If you use the searchbox on this page here you will find the right content. Search engines will eventually catch up.</p>
