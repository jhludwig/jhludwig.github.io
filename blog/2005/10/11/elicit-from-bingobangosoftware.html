<p>Testing out yet another blog posting tool – elicit from <a href="http://http//www.bingobangosoftware.com/makemoney.htm">bingobangosoftware</a>.  A very unique take on blog posting – very focused on helping semipro bloggers manage their posting rate and their affiliate income.  Easy to add affiliate links, easy to manage your stream of posts thru a calendaring interface.  I don’t know yet if I like the tool but I admire the inventiveness.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: OK on initial testing some goods and bads:</p>

<p>* Good: the scheduler worked perfectly. You can create posts for arbitrary times and they will be posted at that time. I realize there are many other tools to do this, but the outlook-like calendar interface is very nice. * So-so: doesn’t respect mt text processing plugins like textile 2 – but has a full wysiwyg editor and html editor so maybe that is ok * Bad: doesn’t seem to post keywords correctly. Wraps the entry in tags. and most strangely, enters the post body in both the entry body and extended entry fields – not helpful!!</p>
