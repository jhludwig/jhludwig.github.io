<p>Boy this space seems to be heating up.  <a href="http://www.anconia.com/rocketpost/">RocketPost</a> is doing great things as far as simple usability – I’ve been trialing for a week and am really impressed with how easy it is to create links to websites, old posts, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bingobangosoftware.com/">Elicit</a> which I’m also trialing has a great calendaring interface and some neat ways to integrate commerce/affiliate programs.  And <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/10/13/qumanas-simple-ad-inclusion-for-blogs/">Qumana</a> looks like it is doing some cool stuff for ad insertion.</p>

<p>It is nice that we are moving past simple wysiwyg editting and really trying to make the blogger’s life better.  Great innovation.</p>
