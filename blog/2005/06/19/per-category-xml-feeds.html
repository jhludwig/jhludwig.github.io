<p>I’ve added per-category XML feeds to my blog – helpful guidance at <a href="http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/000458simple_rss_customizations.php">Learning Movable Type</a>. They are all at www.theludwigs.com/archives/.xml.</p>

<p>So what? Well now I can create meaningful tagclouds for my categories. I’ve got one for the <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/theludwigs/default/50">most recent posts for the whole blog</a>. But more interestingly I’ve got one <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwighalloween/default/50">for just my halloween postings</a> – this gives a great sense of what topics dominate my halloween category, what themes are most popular. And is a nice way to autogenerate tags and hierarchy for the category – I don’t have to do any work! I’ve just added one for <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwigbooks/default/50">my book posts as well</a> (not yet updated) and <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwigsoftware/default/50">my software posts</a> (also not yet updated).</p>

<p>Now it would be even cooler if i could yoke tinyurl functionality to this, so that you could ask for the page www.theludwigs.com/faulkner or www.theludwigs.com/books/faulkner and my site would find the tag in a tagcloud and return the relevant page. Some people have posted <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=374">sample tinyurl clone code in response to ed’s posting</a>, in my copious free time i may look at this. I want my own tinyurl functionality anyway for other reasons.</p>
