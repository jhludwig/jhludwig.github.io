<p>Attended part of the first day of this. Like many conferences, the audience was very bimodal – a minority of very knowledgeable industry people, and a majority of information seekers who are very new to blogs. Sometimes this made the presentations nonsensical – for instance a long discussion about trackback which the knowledgeable people already understood, but which confused the hell out of anyone else.</p>

<p>A lot of interest in how much money you can really make from a blog. How does google adsense work, how can you optimize for it, what can you really gross from adsense, what other kinds of sponsorship/affiliate dollars are available, etc etc etc. People are looking hard for the business model here. Honestly there was not much to chew on tho – the adsense license prevents people from talking in detail about their experiences. Personally I have to wonder about the viability of this cycle – fill a page with content to optimize your google rank, and then make money off of google ads placed on your page – Google sources you the traffic, and then pays you for the traffic. Kind of odd, isn’t Google someday going to figure out how to squeeze the guy in the middle?</p>
