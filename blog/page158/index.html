<p>_I actually don’t know what goes on in large corporations any more. But there’s something strange about SharePoint. Whenever you have a technology that’s sold only to the enterprises ? SharePoint, InfoPath or whatever ? it’s always going to be at a competitive disadvantage, in terms of mind share than something that gets sold to the whole world.</p>

<p>For example, nobody’s ever going to use SharePoint in college. Ever. So no startup is ever going to use SharePoint because none of the kids who leave college are going to know it. This was BEA’s big problem. Kids in college, when they want to learn about Web development, they learn Perl, PHP, maybe Microsoft’s (ASP.Net) stack. They don’t learn about Domino or BEA. So the only way those guys have hope of getting mind share in the market is to have an extensive sales force. They’re always going to be sweeping back the waves against the force of the cheap, easy way of getting started in college._</p>

<p>Dead on.</p>

A great factual overview, a good sense of the broad themes of the time and effort, but I’d have liked a little more depth on some of the characters involved.</p>

<p>It is very fascinating and topical in its discussion about the government incentives – land and capital – that were provided to the entrepreneurs. These incentives were tremendously lucrative, and they had many good and bad impacts – a speedy buildout of the railroad, large private capital commitments that might otherwise not have happened, an increase in the value of public lands, and a huge amount of financial abuse. It is interesting to parallel this to buildouts of our time – the internet buildout, the glacially slow buildout of broadband in the US, emerging private exploitation of space. In the broadband arena, the government has not created the incentives for rapid buildout, rather they have left the buildout in the hands of conservative incumbents and well see where we are.</p>

<p>For private space exploitation, the government hasn’t done much either. I wonder if we could stomach the abuses and the human deathtoll from a highly accelerated buildout – certainly the railroad was built with a somewhat cavalier approach to the lives of the workers, could we stomach this in today’s society?</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/cabling-a-new-house">Cabling a new house</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">18 October 2004</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>So my dad is building a house and wants some advice on cabling – what should he run, what topology. He is building from scratch, all the walls will be open, so he can do whatever he wants.</p>

<p>So based on my experience and the wise counsel of <a href="http://www.mckelvie.org">sam</a> and <a href="http://www.rongfamily.com">rich</a>, here is what I’d do dad.</p>

<p>* <strong>establish a wiring closet</strong> in your basement. All your exterior lines will enter here – phone, cable, satellite, etc. * run all cabling in a <strong>star topology</strong> from this closet. * as a basic cable pack, try to use <strong>standard ?structured cable?</strong> – cat5e + 2 coax, can be purchased in a single bundled cable (http://www.cablestogo.com/product.asp?cat%5Fid=314&amp;sku=43075) which makes install easier. With this setup you can handle 4 phone lines, gbit enet, and two video feeds (for say dual tuner tivo boxes) * do not let anyone talk you into cat5 instead of <strong>cat5e</strong> * make sure the coax and all coax connectors/splitters are <strong>HDTV friendly</strong> – ie 1ghz parts, not the old 900mhz parts. I had to replace a bunch of splitters on my patch panel this year to allow for HDTV signals, you don’t want to do this. * if you have extreme video needs you may want to run additional rg6 (coax) cables to your home theater setup. Sam explains: <em>currently, four RG6 cables are required to support unlimited DSB devices (four cables come out of the satellite dish; these are multiplexed onto a single cable for each tuner). That number could increase as the number of LNB’s increase (currently 3 for HD DirecTV). I recommend running at least 4 RG6 cables to each location that will potentially host a multi-tuner receiver (e.g., Tivo).</em> * run your standard cable pack to any spot you have a tv or phone – family room, den, kitchen, bedrooms, basement, garage. For rooms that may see a lot of use – family room, office – run two or three sets. * and I’d run an extra set of cables and leave them unused in the attic or crawlspace for the family room and office. When you remodel later and want cables in a different place, you can easily pull the unused set down.</p>

<p><strong>What about wireless lan and wireless phones?</strong> Well I have a whole pile of discarded wifi and wireless phone gear at my house. I personally am unsatisfied with coverage, quality, and security/complexity. I’d reserve wireless use for particular rooms – you can always put a mini wifi access point in a room for wifi in that room if you need it at some point. But as long as your walls are open, I’d run the cabling.</p>

<p><strong>What about multiroom audio?</strong> I don’t think running special analog cables is worth it, the scenarios that this supports are pretty limited. You can always slap a small pc or remote media player box like the <a href="http://www.slimp3.com/">squeezebox</a> in additional rooms if you want access to your music collection in these rooms.</p>

<p><strong>What about intelligent lighting?</strong> Well I don’t have it and haven’t missed it. Sam has some more sage advice if you want to go down this path: <em>If home automation is of interest, I’d consider adding a control line to each switch box (cat5, for example). At a minimum, make sure power, neutral, and ground are available at every switch box (light switch-boxes sometimes are missing neutral or ground), so that powered components can be added at the box.</em></p>

<p>And from my Dad: There are only two essential tools you must have in your toolbox – wd40, and duct tape.</p>

<p>* If it is supposed to move and it doesn’t – wd40 is the answer. * If it is not supposed to move and it does – duct tape.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the planet I installed the Google Desktop over the weekend. No noticeable perf drag on my system.</p>

<p>I had read that it would not work against network drives, but I have ?My Documents? folder pointed to a network drive and indexing worked fine, <a href="http://www.slivka.com">ben</a> pointed this nice fact out to me. I’d like it to pick up some other network shares and I wonder if it can be coerced into doing so – I don’t see any ini file, the only likely seeming reg key is an empty key named CRAWL_DIRS, I wonder what it does?</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">rich</a> and ben and I discussed in email, we all noted the contrasts between the google desktop and winfs (and its intellectual precursor, ofs in cairo). Hmmm, there may be some architectural and project management lessons to be learned here. A light layer on existing storage both works and is shipping. Further benefits will accrue as developers and users provide fb, allowing google to incrementally improve and expand the facility – while winfs is still not shipping.</p>

<p>All sound systems deployed and tested. All props deployed. Most lights deployed. Pneumatic cable routed. Fog cabling deployed.</p>

<p>The huge outstanding work item is to deploy my dmx control system. Run cabling, hook up all dimmers, debug the control program. Oh and actually test the pneumatic effects.</p>

<p>What do the Buckeyes get awarded those leaves on their helmets for exactly? I thought it was good play. It must be for grooming, tidy lockers, and attendance. Because clearly the team is completely dysfunctional.</p>
