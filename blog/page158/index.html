    <p><strong>Broadband to the home</strong></p>

<p>We are thinking about some business opportunities in the home networking space. I’d love to hear from you all about your needs and problems. Some questions I have:</p>

<p>- Do you have a cablemodem or dsl connection to the internet now? Are you thinking of getting one? - Do you have multiple PCs in your house that you want to connect up to the cablemodem or dsl connection? How are you going to do that? - Are you worried about security of your PCs once you put them on this cablemodem or dsl connection? What are you willing to spend to prevent virus attacks each month? Do you spend money today on virus checking software, or a virus checking service, or on a firewall? - Are you worried about your family’s use of the internet? What will you spend to filter out objectionable content for your kids? Do you spend anything today on this? - Are you worried about backup of all the files on your PCs? Would you pay for a service to backup your files over your cablemodem or dsl connection so that they were safely stored up on the network? Do you spend money today on backup software or a backup service? - Do you share photos today with your extended family? Why or why not? What is preventing you?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/03/07/salmon.html">Salmon</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Salmon</strong></p>

<p>One of my pet environmental peeves. We live here in the great Pacific Northwest, we have access to wonderful wild salmon stock for our tables. Wild salmon is an incredibly good food for you nutritionally, high in omega-3 acids.</p>

<p>Sadly tho we are seeing the widescale introduction of atlantic salmon farming here in the northwest. There is little good about this in my mind. <a href="http://www.ems.org/salmon/salmon_types.html">Farmed atlantic salmon</a> are not as nutrionally good for you due to the feedstock they consume; they are dyed pink so that they look attractive; they escape from their pens and compete with the local wild stock; they attract sea lions and seals which are then <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=seals06m&amp;date=20020306&amp;query=sea+lion">killed</a> by farmers to protect their fish stock.</p>

<p>Farm raised salmon is cheaper for restaurants than wild salmon, so we are slowly seeing it creep into menus, even here in the Pacific Northwest. The restaurants are not particularly upfront about it – you have to ask very precise questions to make sure you are consuming wild troll-caught Pacific salmon, and not farmed Atlantic salmon.</p>

    <p><strong>Some current tech topics</strong></p>

<p>My buddy Rich has a lot of great info up on his <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/weblog/">weblog</a> about a variety of topics. Recently he and I have been captivated with low cost storage systems. He’s figured out the way to build a really low cost 120GB file server for your network, including full mirroring for disaster recovery purposes. Very cool, I will probably build one of these. With something like this on your home network, you don’t need to worry about buying big hard disks on your PCs in the future.</p>

<p>Another thing coming to your home network is wireless networking. <a href="http://80211b.weblogger.com/">This site</a> is a great source of news and tech tips.</p>

<p>We’ve also noticed in compusa and other computer stores recently that routers and wireless routers for the home are flying off the shelves. For instance look at the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/658666/ref=pc_hp_ln_ne/103-9804194-5298262">top sellers</a> at Amazon in this category right now. Everyone who has a dsl or cable modem connection is wiring up their house to get all their PCs on that connection – and wireless is often the way to go.</p>

<p>We’re excited about this. With all this networking getting deployed, there is the opportunity to provide the solutions and apps on top of this infrastructure that consumers really want. For instance, why is it so hard for me to share pictures with the rest of you? Why don’t new pictures that I take just show up on your home network for viewing?</p>

<p>We had a great trip down to Tucson and Scottsdale last week. It is our so-called “Mid Winter Break” or “Ski Week” – a week off from school in mid February. We get spring break later in April.</p>

<p>We had beautiful weather – approaching 80 each day, but cool at night. C and Liz stayed at <a href="http://www.canyonranch.com/tucson/index.asp">Canyon Ranch</a>, John and John at <a href="http://www.loewshotels.com/hotels/tucson/default.asp">Loew’s Ventana Canyon Resort</a>. Canyon Ranch is awesome, “camp for grownups”, but they have an age limit of 14 so we can’t all go there yet.</p>

<p>While the girls were spa-ing, John and John hit all the tourist attractions in Tucson including <a href="http://www.oldtucson.com/">Old Tucson Studios</a> -- fun old west stunt shows, a real hoot.</p>

    <p><strong>Back Live</strong></p>

<p>Whew the server is back live. Had some problems which I hopefully cleaned up. Mostly stupid configuration problems on my part.</p>

<p>Actually take one part general insecurity of the internet, one part windows nt security holes, one part laziness on my part, and one part stupid misconfiguration, and ouila, you have what happened to me. First of all my system was identified as a valid NT server by the various profilers that are running on the internet and my IP address was stuffed away into all the profiler databases. Then all the standard tools were run against my server to find potential exploits and many were found – mostly because I didn’t keep my server up to date on security patches and lockdown tools. Then I screwed up and let anonymous users write to my FTP server.</p>

<p>Nothing particularly malicious happened, some folks just used my server as a staging area for some pirated PC software and some pirated gameboy advance software and some pirated music. I have a large disk drive, I didn’t even notice the usage for a couple days. Then as I was doing some directory maintenance I noticed some unusual directories that I had not created. A little investigation of the directory contents and logs and running tasks and ports in use on my machine let me know I had a problem and so I yanked the net tap. After investigating all the issues for a couple days, I concluded the best thing to do was to reformat the drives and reinstall Windows NT with all the latest patches and lockdown tools. And also tighten up the firewalls between my server and the open internet.</p>

<p>Thankfully my website content is actually stored elsewhere and just propagated regularly to the server so I didn’t actually lose any content. Just some time. And I learned some great lessons along the way. In a strange way it was fun.</p>

<p>Glad to be back tho…</p>

    <p><strong>Herbfarm</strong></p>

<p>Well we had our Herbfarm dinner last night. Quite an experience, we can see why this place has a national reputation. The owners are passionate about their restaurant and they create a real event, almost a festival atmosphere.</p>

<p>The restaurant is in a beautiful building. A gorgeous dining room, a large open kitchen, an attached wine cellar, all in french country style.</p>

<p>We sat down at 7pm and got up a little after midnight. The food list (none of these huge servings):</p>

<p>- Sauteed Oyster with Sorrel Sauce - Quail Egg Benedict with Cured Salmon and Watercress Sauce - Perigord Black Truffle &amp; Leek Tart - Celery Root &amp; Oregon White Truffle Ravioli - Alaskan Side Stripe Shrimp in Truffled Garlic Sabayon with Fennel Tempura and Apple Slaw - Seared Duck Foie Gras and Perigord Truffles with Yellow Finn Potatoes, Briased Endive &amp; Shallot RIngs - Sorbet of Douglas Fir - Thyme-grilled Squab with Oregon Black Truffles, Lentils, Bloomsdale Spinach and Golden Beets - Juniper Grove Goat Cheese Buche with Charlotte of Spice Bread &amp; Tart Cherry Chutney - Wild Huckleberry Souffle with Rose Geranium Sauce - Armagnac, Thyme &amp; Prune Ice Cream Crepe with Maple-poached Pears - Chocolate Eclair with Lavender Praline Cream - Assorted chocolate Truffles</p>

<p>And we had 6 different wines - 97 Argyle Brut, 2000 Matthews Cellars Semillon, 99 Adelsheim Clone 76 Chardonnay, 98 Beran Vineyards Estate Pinot Noir, 94 Chateau Sainte Michelle Artist’s Series Meritage, and an 1875 Barbieto Malvazia Madeira.</p>

<p>It was quite an adventure. We had more fun than we anticipated, the service was amazing and friendly, and we were seated close enough to other tables to talk with other diners (a couple who had driven 7 hours from Missoula for the dinner).</p>

<p>To our surprise I think we liked the Foie Gras the best of all the dishes. But they were all fascinating.</p>
