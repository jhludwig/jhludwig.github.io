				<p><p>All over the map here. Probably some pithy summary to write about how apps and data of the future should be partitioned and hosted.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000028.html" title="Adam Bosworth's Weblog: Evolution in Action">Adam Bosworth’s Weblog: Evolution in Action</a>: <em>The user interface customized itself to the users needs, location, and data in a dynamic way through the magic of dynamic page layout. Today, a full ten years later, most windows apps still don’t do that. But heck they are only 2 or 3 or 4 generations evolved. Services, in the last decade, may have evolved 600 times by now all in reaction to what they have learned directly from customer use.</em> A pithy observation. * From <a href="http://www.windley.com/2004/11/03.html#a1505">windley.com</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_7/102-4131696-2978514?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;node=13584001&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">Amazon’s Simple Queue Service.</a> Interesting that AMZN would offer such a general purpose service. * Jon Udell on the <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/29.html#a1104">myth of the one true device</a>. Very wise. People don’t really need or want convergence of devices – they do want convergence of data. * <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=61a44955-441b-4e20-b994-8ff8139e1aa1">The twilight of Passport</a>. Some people never thought MSFT should offer a general service for the web, some people thought Passport should just make it easy to have a single login for all MSFT sites – which is where it seems things are ending up. * Jon Udell <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/10/22/43OPstrategic_1.html">under gmail’s hood</a>. * I haven’t really dug into the <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=741">newsgator online feature allowing ratings on your site</a> but it seems like a great notion. I love the idea of spewing ratings around (for articles, restaurants, books, etc) and then letting someone aggregate them, rather than having to post my rating and content to someone else’s site. * From <a href="http://www.windley.com/2004/10/29.html#a1498">windley.com</a> again, a <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">web-based slide show system</a>. Hmm. How long til people can give up powerpoint and go to a server model? * <a href="http://www.beinsync.com/">Beinsync</a> -- one of the N services that lets you keep folders in sync across the net.</p>

				<p><p>…is not the presidential results. I am sure the country will muddle through whoever is inhabiting that office.</p>

<p>The thing that is of most local, immediate importance to me is the failure of I-884, the education funding initiative. I’m suprised about the totality of the failure here. Obviously the electorate does not like new taxes. It is obviously going to take way more effort to increase our educational funding – it is going to take unified statewide political support – both parties, all major state and federal elected officials – as well as private sector leaders to ever push any significant educational funding package through.</p>

				<p><p>Great weather! Near full moon, clear and crisp, no rain, very little wind. Perfect for fog creation and fog persistence…</p>

<p>Had our first visitors saturday nite – friends. Plus a lot of drivebys that evening.</p>

<p>Sunday the traffic started early – 4pm – some friends, and parents bringing children who were too scared to come at night.</p>

<p>Crush started at 6. Last visitors at 9:20. We had a shopping cart and a half of candy, and had to start rationing at 8:00. We ended up with just a dozen pieces of candy left.</p>

<p>Lots of ?scream? masks. Lots of teenagers with the slightest attempts at costumes. Princesses, witches. Martial arts.</p>

<p>Best props – fog as always, kids love fog. My demented disfigured monk costume, a lot of people thought I was a prop. Lots of tombstones and skeletons. Our haunted talking tree – popular with all ages.</p>

<p>Bugs: Pneumatics good but finicky. Need to invest a lot more in the offseason on testing and construction of pneumatics. Audio – sound quality great but inflexible – discrete sound sources hardwired via speakerwire to outdoor speakers. Really need a virtual soundboard and retargetable delivery over ip, but weather and power present issues.</p>

<p>Pix later this week.</p>

<p>It is fascinating to watch Apple and Microsoft hollow out the consumer electronics industry. Apple building from the iPod base, gradually wiping out all the other audio (and video) products in the home and car. Microsoft starting from the WinXP Media Center edition, wiping out all the other home video and audio products. Then you have the content owners using DRM to force their proprietary decoder hardware into the home. A fascinating collision of giants. As much as I love Apple’s products – how is their strategy any different than the Mac strategy vs PCs, and how did that work out for Apple?</p>

<p>C’mon guys, get aggressive! Strike while the iron is hot. You should strive to get to 30% over the next year. If you don’t set an aggressive goal, you won’t get great results.</p>
