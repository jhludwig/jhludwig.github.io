I installed the <a href="http://www.threedegrees.com">threedegrees</a> beta from Microsoft. Firstly just a laughable install for a consumer product – i had to download and install a separate system component, i had to reboot, i had to register AND i had to log in with my passport AND i had to provide the double secret beta key, and i had to use the miserable microsoft download manager. Then when i tried to use it, it gave me some error message about my IPv6 stack not being properly configured! an IPv6 stack that it had installed. Just hilarious – who would build a dependency on an IPv6 stack into a consumer product?</p>

				<p><p><strong>Miserable experience with Alienware</strong>. I have nearly begged <a href="http://www.alienware.com/main/main.asp?">Alienware</a> to take my money for a new machine. After nearly a month trying to get them to take my money, I give up. Because I wanted to ship the machine to my office, while my credit card bills go to my home address, they required a fax of my driver’s license (why I don’t know). I faxed it to them 4 times over two days as two different people called me to complain that they couldn’t read the expiration date. I zoomed the license and toned down the contrast so that the expiration date was as visible as possible. I thought they were happy and I went away on vacation. I got back after two weeks and – no machine. I contacted them and they said they still couldn’t read the license and are still waiting for me to fax me a new one, though they hadn’t bothered to call me. In this time of course a credit card charge could have cleared but no, that apparently isn’t good enough for them, somehow a faxed copy of a driver’s license is the key to their entire system. Today I gave up, I’ll order from someone else.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Bellevue and nukes</strong>. From a colleague who knows better than I do, answering the question “If Seattle was targetted by a nuke, would we be safe here in Bellevue?”:</p>

<p><em>Depends on the size. The Hiroshima (fission) bomb had a lethal radius of 2 - 3 miles. Large fusion bombs (very hard to make, North Korea can’t produce them) could have a lethal radius up to 30 miles. I would want to be further away then Bellevue if downtown Seattle was hit. Also, its very hard to make a long range missile accurate. The probable accuracy of a North Korean missile is 1 - 2 miles (or worse) at that range. Go to Monroe!</em></p>

				<p><p><strong>Sun Launches ‘Plan B”.</strong> Sun is going to work harder to get <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,0,867743,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">PC OEMs and endusers to install their JVM</a>. Duh. This should have been their plan A all along. Obviously PC OEMs are willing to ship a lot of software – look at all the shovelware that comes on a new PC. The fact that they haven’t been willing to ship the JVM is really telling – it is saying that a Java VM is more useless than every other piece of cruddy software that they ship – this is truly stunning given the quality of some of the shovelware. Sun should listen to OEMs and build a few Java apps that actually solve some interesting OEM problems, and then every OEM would take the apps and the VM.</p>
