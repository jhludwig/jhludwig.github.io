    <p><a href="http://werbach.com/blog/2003/12/15.html#a1339" title="WERBLOG">WERBLOG</a> points to a nickel-sized 1gig drive from Toshiba. I know <a href="http://www.smithstuff.net">Adrian</a> is really happy with his usb storage keyfob. I am wondering what the logical endpoint of this trend is. When we can all carry around many gigs of data in a keyfob, along with a lot of MIPs, what will we use it for? It seems like most people today who carry around a lot of storage are either using it as a sneakernet, or as music storage. When i can carry gigs and gigs, will this change? I think the cached music storage scenario is a long term valid scenario. I can also see the cached photo/video collection with viewer – the digital equivalent of a grandma’s brag book – though the viewing surface bloats the size of the device, so maybe i just want a way to get video streams out. What else will we use a very small, powerful, portable device for? I personally find the need to capture info a lot when I am wandering around – i’d like to grab a upc code for later internet price shopping, or tag a song that is playing for later download, or remember a store/restaurant/location for later blogging, or capture a snippet of audio, or receive a bluetooth business card, etc. Today I whip out the blackberry and type things in, but I wonder if a keyfob-sized device that could capture and store a whole range of audio, rf, and visual input would be useful.</p>

    <p>Ok I installed <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001206.html" title="a little ludwig goes a long way: Electric Shoebox">Electric Shoebox</a> and I am a little disappointed.</p>

<p>I already have my photos organized into file folders and subfolders. On a network drive so that they are accessible from all the machines in my house. But like every other photo mgmt app, Electric Shoebox wants to import them into a new container hierarchy (shoeboxes and albums). I DON’T WANT TO DO THIS. All of my myriad apps and camera uploaders all know how to deal with file folders, all my pcs can deal with file folders remotely, a new hierarchy scheme is bad bad bad. So for that reason alone I won’t use Electric Shoebox. The fact that its import wizard won’t even allow me to import from network drives, and that the import UI doesn’t seem to handle subfolders, just further makes it useless.</p>

<p>I want the sharing features but I want them to work with just regular file folders. I wish ISVs would get this thru their heads – don’t invent clever new storage hierarchies, the ones we have are fine. Just layer your functionality onto the existing hierarchies. There is no way I am going to adopt your private new hierarchy because no other app or vendor in the world will know what to do with it. Only the big boys like MSFT can push a new storage scheme (for instance WinFS).</p>
