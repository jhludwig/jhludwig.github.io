				<p><p><strong>Bellevue and nukes</strong>. From a colleague who knows better than I do, answering the question “If Seattle was targetted by a nuke, would we be safe here in Bellevue?”:</p>

<p><em>Depends on the size. The Hiroshima (fission) bomb had a lethal radius of 2 - 3 miles. Large fusion bombs (very hard to make, North Korea can’t produce them) could have a lethal radius up to 30 miles. I would want to be further away then Bellevue if downtown Seattle was hit. Also, its very hard to make a long range missile accurate. The probable accuracy of a North Korean missile is 1 - 2 miles (or worse) at that range. Go to Monroe!</em></p>

Great weather, lots of humpback whales, a fun trip up to the caldera, some good stargazing.

I don’t want the full set of RSS headlines in the IM client, just the ones that have been posted in say the last hour (or whatever I configure the trigger to be). I started thinking about this today as I was thinking about picture sharing with my family – I already have a list of my family members in my AIM and MSN IM clients, why can’t I just put some notifications up there from them?</p>

				<p><p><strong>Your Strategy Is What You Ship</strong>. I was reminded of this quote today, taught to me when I was a snot-nosed inexperienced consulting brat in the strategy practice of <a href="http://www.bah.com">Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton</a>. One of the more experienced consultants in the operations practice sneered at some inane observation I made one day and said “Your strategy is what you ship”.</p>

<p>Today’s strategy lesson – Microsoft’s developer tools and platform sdks. I am an MSDN subscriber and I get absolutely pounds of CDs from Microsoft and gigabytes of articles, tools, libraries, etc. It is a dizzying and confusing array of tools – and relatively pricey too. The imputed strategy here is “Microsoft only cares about enterprise developers – if you are a young, starving, novice programmer, there is no entry path to the Microsoft platform. You should go use PHP and Perl and Python and other environments that are cheap and easy to start with.” I doubt this is what any slidedeck at Microsoft says but that is sure how it feels.</p>
