  <h1><a href="/2002/09/03/seattle-sports.html">Seattle Sports</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Seattle Sports</strong>. Man it seems like a bad time to be a fan in this town. Mariners are fun but can’t quite get over the top, and my understanding of the new labor deal is that the Mariners will need to give up cash to others, thereby affecting Mariners competitiveness over the next 5 years. The Sonics seem unable to get or retain top talent, and the current management has a history of less-than-great deals. I have a hard time getting excited about the Seahawks, Holmgren just seems like a poseur to me. My favorite college sport, basketball, is not a game the Huskies excel at, and there is no arena in town that is large enough to host anything but first-round NCAA games. The football Huskies are a bright spot, tho last weekend was painful. But I am not feeling generally optimistic.</p>

    <p><strong>Outage</strong>. Off the web most of yesterday, as was our office at <a href="http://www.ignitionpartners.com">Ignition</a>. Routing problem at <a href="http://www.conxion.net">Conxion</a>. Surprising how hard it was to find – you would think that they could have discovered the problem in less than 8-10 hours.</p>

<p>Surprising how useless I am without the net for a day. No email. No shopping. No research. I just kept running “ping 206.204.4.6” all day long, trying to see my DNS server…</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/08/30/groove-usage.html">Groove Usage</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Groove Usage</strong>. <a href="http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/08/30.html#a53">Ray</a> notes that 25% of Groove users use it to sync their own files across multiple locations. The home/work sync problem is a huge one that, with broadband homes, ought to be solveable. Groove is a way but very heavyweight for the intended purpose. There has to be a solution that is much lighter that plugs into Windows and native Windows apps in a cleaner way. I’ve tried setting up my own VPN server at home but that is not worth the hassle. The WinXP remote desktop stuff is so unintuitive, it is not a good solution. I just want to be able to access any of my work or home files from any location without installing whole new app (like Groove) and without paying some service fee to store the files up in the cloud – I already have tons of storage, thank you.</p>

If the fireball really makes it easy to do all the things it claims, the integration would be worth something.</p>

    <p><strong>Torvalds on Patents</strong>. Couldn’t agree more – <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/7636/">LWN: Re: large page patch</a>. I refuse to look at patent material when startups try to present their patent portfolio to us. In fact, any startup that leads their presentation to us with “we have this bank of patents” I view with great suspicion – I suspect they are simply seeding the world with info about their patent so that they can claim knowing infringement later.</p>
