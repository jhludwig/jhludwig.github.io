				<p><p>Finally feeling good enough to start tinkering again, and to blog about it.</p>

<p>I’m continuing my odyssey to attach every piece of technology I can to my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001775.html">sharp aquous beast of a tv.</a> My Mac Mini arrived last week and I have it hooked up now to the DVI port. Looks great. The gotchas: Apple saves money by shipping the mini with no cables, so you have to go buy a DVI cable ($70 at least) and a stereo mini-jack cable (Aside – why does Apple even bother putting a speaker in the mac mini???). 2nd gotcha – the sharp defaults to an analog video signal from the pc, and you have to go wade thru the menus to force it to look for a digital signal – seems like this could be auto-detected. The mini makes a great hometheater pc – small, quiet, a fine dvd player. And I have bittorrent running on it to fill up the hard disk with tv content.</p>

<p>For additional fun I plugged a <a href="http://www.kingston.com/products/pccard.asp">kingston pcmcia hard drive</a> into the pcmcia port on aquous. What a bizarre feature. I can play slide shows and videos off the pccard. Oh and I can take snapshots and video captures of the current signal, as long as it is from a crappy analog input – analog coax, analog s-video. the tv won’t capture the signal from a digital input or from the component inputs, probably to make the mpaa et al happy. So basically it is a really funky and limited DVR. Just goes to show again how much trouble Tivo is in – it is trivial to slam DVR software into any box now, and storage is cheap.</p>

<p>I still have to fill up the hdmi and 1394 inputs…</p>

				<p><p>Today’s adventure – getting a cablecard from comcast. As anyone knows, their website is quite silent on how to order a cablecard. If you call them and ask for it, they will provide it finally with some arm twisting.</p>

<p>Two techs showed up today. The physical install in <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001775.html">my sharp aquos</a> was quite straightforward. The setup after that was confusing and we still don’t have it right.</p>

<p>First of all, the sharp manual is hilariously bad. I’m not sure anyone ever tried these instructions on how to install a cablecard. You have to make sure you are on tv input, you have to switch the input type over to cable, and then you have to make sure you hit the “digital” button on the remote. Several of this steps are left out in the manual. But I don’t blame the manual writers completely – the menu structure on the tv itself is hopelessly modal. If you happen to have the current input set to a component or hdmi or dvi input, you will never find the right menu items. But we finally figured it out.</p>

<p>The cablecard was recognized, we had to call a bunch of digits into comcast. In their network they authorize this card, and then I guess credentials are downloaded to the card which tell it what tv channels I’m allowed to see. This takes a little while, 10-15 minutes. Then digital channels start showing up.</p>

<p>Second key tip – the sharp aquous has separate coax inputs for digital or analog. You want to split your cable using a 1ghz splitter and feed the input to both. Otherwise you will only get the digital channels – which in our market, for instance, means you could never watch CBS.</p>

<p>Some things still aren’t working – I can’t see ESPN-HD for instance. Another service call in the offing.</p>

<p>In a future post I’ll expand on my feelings – but man, tv setup and video delivery to the home is just getting more complicated, not less – there are huge opportunities here to do better.</p>

				<p><p>Attended part of the first day of this. Like many conferences, the audience was very bimodal – a minority of very knowledgeable industry people, and a majority of information seekers who are very new to blogs. Sometimes this made the presentations nonsensical – for instance a long discussion about trackback which the knowledgeable people already understood, but which confused the hell out of anyone else.</p>

<p>A lot of interest in how much money you can really make from a blog. How does google adsense work, how can you optimize for it, what can you really gross from adsense, what other kinds of sponsorship/affiliate dollars are available, etc etc etc. People are looking hard for the business model here. Honestly there was not much to chew on tho – the adsense license prevents people from talking in detail about their experiences. Personally I have to wonder about the viability of this cycle – fill a page with content to optimize your google rank, and then make money off of google ads placed on your page – Google sources you the traffic, and then pays you for the traffic. Kind of odd, isn’t Google someday going to figure out how to squeeze the guy in the middle?</p>

				<p><p>To take full advantage of the <a href="http://www.purenetworks.com">Network Magic</a> beta release (i’m on the board), I decided to upgrade my router/firewall from a sonicwall box I’ve had for 3-4 years to a Linksys gigabit ethernet router (i’ll be switching all my nics to gigabit nics as well – $29 for the cheapest GBE nics at fry’s).</p>

<p>The thing you must must must do – note the mac address of your old router first, because comcast ties your service to a specific mac address. I failed to do this and spent 10 minutes trying to figure out why my net wasn’t working and then noticed that my new linksys box was unable to acquire an address via dhcp. thankfully the linksys box lets you set its mac address to whatever you want, once i made this change, things were happy.</p>

<p>How regular humans will ever figure this out is beyond me. I guess they will call comcast. Why doesn’t comcast make this easy for their customers?</p>

I don’t really want to spew my personal content all over the web tho, i want these guys to aggregate my list from my own blog. * <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/18.html#a9229">the no-follow tag</a>. here’s hoping that mt does a rev that just slams all the right html all over my blog, i don’t want to go fix all this myself. * <a href="http://go.theregister.com/feed/2004/12/30/ms_ends_pass/">Microsoft shuts down passport service.</a> Classic example of trying to force a platform down people’s throats, instead of just creating something of great utility.

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>When I first read last week about the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=fbi+computer+overhaul&amp;btnG=Search+News">problems with the FBI computer system overhaul</a>, I was pissed at our government. $170M wasted, now another $2M to consultants to figure out why. What waste – and in an important system.</p>

<p>On further reflection, this is such an immature reaction on my part. It is the easy reaction. Today, on inauguration day, I am reminded of JFK’s words – “Ask not what your country can do for you; Ask what you can do for your country.”</p>

<p>Our industry should be reaching out to help the FBI. We can’t expect the FBI to be expert at IT, or to be able to necessarily hire or evaluate the best IT staff or consultants. It is not the FBI’s core competency. The FBI needs to solve a really big database problem – I bet there are people at MSFT, Oracle, Google who know something about these problems and could help.</p>

<p>I’m not dying to help the FBI build some huge tracking database for every citizen – but if they have the legal mandate to build something, and are going to build it, I certainly feel like we should help them spend our tax dollars wisely and get a system that does something useful.</p>

<p>Anyway – just a reminder to myself – it is not the government’s job to solve all our problems – it is our responsibility to pitch in and help solve the issues in our society that need solutions or that we are uniquely equipped to help solve.</p>

				<p><p>* “The Fermata”:amazon by Nicholson Baker. Reardon recommended this book to me, and I am worried for his soul. Very artfully crafted, very engaging, a nice moral redemption of sorts for the main character. And some interesting early discussion on moral relativity that isn’t ever really fully explored. But…all wrapped up in a story that is so smutty and demeaning that it sinks the book. Maybe that is just my midwestern upbringing. All I know is that I’m embarrassed to have the book on my shelves. I’m not sad I read it, but I won’t pick up another book by Baker. * “A Coffin for Dmitrios”:amazon by Eric Ambler. What a fine fine tale. My first ambler, a great story of crime and human nature. I find it far more approachable than le carre, and far deeper than the popular crime and suspense novels of today. * “Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation, Second Edition”:amazon by Briggs et al. A fine reference. A little dated re browser details. Nothing probably to separate this from any other CSS reference, I just needed something reasonable.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/impressions-of-duluth">Impressions of Duluth</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">17 January 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Landed in Duluth at 9pm Saturday. Temperature on the ground: -20 degrees F. Airport has one ticket counter, a handful of gates, and a luggage carousel the size of a small bedroom.</p>

<p>Hey, everyone here sounds like Frances McDormand in <strong><em>Fargo</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Checked in to the brand new <a href="http://www.countryinns.com/duluthmn_north">Country Inn</a> near the airport. Very pleasant, brand new. A million kids in the hotel – hockey teams in town for a tournament. All running thru the halls in swimsuits to the indoor heated pool and slide – who knew I should bring a swimsuit to Duluth in January?</p>

<p>Watching the local NBC affiliate news was an education all by itself about northern Minnesota. The news anchor and the weatherman both looked to be about 24 – they are the backup team at the station – I guess if you are a new journalism grad, Duluth is the kind of market you can start in. The weather report was all about “how many consecutive hours will the temperature stay below zero”. Record is 160+ as I recall. We’re at 60+ now, the weatherman doesn’t think we’ll break the record.</p>

<p>Sports report – Div III college hockey, Div II college hockey, Div I college hockey, high school hockey, minor league hockey. Oh yeah at the end he mentioned the NFL playoff results.</p>

<p>Down to 24 below overnight. The building popped and cracked all night long – a constant battle between freezing weather and our room heater. And not a gentle popping and cracking – more like the last 30 seconds of a bag of microwave popcorn, all night long.</p>
