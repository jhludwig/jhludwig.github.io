    <p>OK you don’t need another sweatshirt or t-shirt. You have 7 varieties of caps. You have the windbreaker. The flag. The posters, the books. The marching band records. The foam finger. A Brutus costume. The “Muck Fichigan” pin. So what do you need? Some fine ideas from the alumni mag:</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://www.fossil.com/buckeyes">Fossil watch</a>. Ok not that exotic. * The <a href="http://www.buckeyeblazer.com">scarlet or gray blazer</a>. Always in fashion. * The <a href="http://www.thepopcornfactory.com/Ohio05">popcorn tin</a>. (Hey Marion, how did you let this business slip to some company in Virginia? Marion is the popcorn capital of the world!) * The <a href="http://www.littlebandman.com">marching band miniatures</a>. * Not one, but two varieties of Buckeye Coffee – <a href="http://www.varsityblends.com/ohiostate">Ohio State Varsity Blends</a> or <a href="http://www.drinkstorm.com">Drinkstorm</a>. Particularly apropo for Seattle area residents like me. * Coffee cups and other pottery at <a href="http://www.hartstonepottery.com">Hartstone Pottery</a> * A <a href="http://www.tru-fan.com">buckeye carpet</a>. This would look great in the living room. * A <a href="http://www.sportswoodfurniture.com">buckeye park bench</a>. And here is your living room furniture. * And <a href="http://www.gamedaymurals.com">a mural for the wall</a> – won’t they wonder about our civilization 1000 years from now when they dig this up. * <a href="http://www.buckeyecrunch.com">Buckeye Crunch cereal</a> – the breakfast of true champions. * Or a trip to an exotic part of the world with a group of alums – <a href="http://www.ohiostatealumni.org/tours">Alumni Tours</a>. Nothing says buckeye pride like a trip down the Nile.</p>

<p>Enjoy! And I will accept any and all of these for the holidays.</p>

    <p>Not much reading in the last month due to Halloween. But I got a couple in:</p>

<p>* “Olympus by Dan Simmons”:amazon. Probably more enjoyable if you know greek myth and shakespeare inside and out. An ok tale. Still wishing that Dan would produce something like “Hyperion”:amazon again – the Shrike is one of the greatest beings in science fiction. * “Hot Property by Pat Choate”:amazon. Good retrospective of IP systems. I was uninformed about the large differences in patent systems across different countries, and how the patent systems in other lands are not designed to protect inventors as much as they are designed to further industrial policy. Made me a stronger supporter of ip protection. Not sure how I really feel about the nationalistic tone in the book, I’d like to see a more global view of IP policy.</p>

  <li>I’m not saying MSFT has committed this error, but I like <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/02.html">Joel’s definition of “the Marimba Phenomenon”</a> – <em>what happens when you spend more on PR and marketing than on development. “Result: everybody checks out your code, and it’s not good yet. These people will be permanently convinced that your code is simple and inadequate, even if you improve it drastically later.”</em></li>
  <li>Office Live sounds interesting – and I wonder if it isn’t a great boon for startups. By validating a <a href="http://www.edbott.com/weblog/?p=1112">hosted intranet</a> offering, Microsoft is kick starting the market. If the Microsoft product isn’t a homerun, someone will fill the void.</li>

    <p>Minor meltdown over the last 6 days. My DMX512 system became inhabited by gremlins. Really teh gear is not supposed to be used outdoors so the fact that it survived 5-6 years is amazing. But I was using it to control every effect and so the s$%t hit the fan. Over the past 6 days I have ripped DMX control out of most of the system and gone to simpler, cheaper x10 and Zwave. Much more durable signalling (wireless and powerline) but much higher latency. I have kept DMX only for my lightning effects, as latency matters and I don’t have the time to build a bunch of color organs (tho next year).</p>

<p>Anyway nearly everything is working again. I have a major air leak in my pneumatics which I will fix tomorrow.</p>

<p>Oh and a rant – why so many fricking plug types for 220V service? The circular locking type, the regular 3 prong with a 90-degree twist on one of the prongs, and the bigger 3 prong? And this is all for 20A service. Getting things to plug together is a major PITA. Some electrician out there probably knows the answer and can probably tell me why converting from circular locking plugs to the 3 prong type is a major no-no.</p>

    <p>From <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4490">gadgetopia</a>.  Great stuff.  And to respect his first point (“No author biographies”) I’ve added an <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/about/">About</a> category and sidebar section.  Hence all the generic posts yesterday.</p>

<p>Kind of cool that it really integrates posting and tagging, but the posting tool is too weak to use. I can’t set categories or keywords on a post for instance.</p>

    <p>I blog for myself. The site is my annotated bookmarks and my longterm memory. I search it regularly to find that certain halloween prop idea, that book I read, that software I tried. I don’t care much about my readership, though I have gotten a lot of value from readers – software suggestions, reconnects from old friends, business proposals.</p>

<p>I originally intended to use my blog to communicate with family but the lack of simple privacy solutions killed that.</p>
