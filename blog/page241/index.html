				<p><p><strong>Ohio State “Fans”.</strong> Kevin is upset about the <a href="http://www.kevinholtsberry.com/blog/archives/002498.html#002498">amoral and dangerous actions</a> of some people in Columbus celebrating the Ohio State win. It upsets me too. The university has spoken out, Coach Tressel should speak out against if he hasn’t, and the players should as well.</p>

<p>I don’t think this behaviour is unique to Columbus – I am sure that, had Michigan won, some people would have taken the opportunity to misbehave in Detroit – some of the citizenry there have proven themselves to be adept at misbehaving every year around Halloween. And I note that of the 49 arrests so far, only 7 are students, and hopefully the bulk of the misdeeds will be seen to have been done by people not associated with the University.</p>

<p>But everyone should be made accountable for their actions, and the University and the members of the football program should be very vocal in denouncing this behaviour.</p>

And for the first two hours, we were flying through the Convention Center on the zipline, rapelling down the walls, navigating rope bridges above the dining room, etc. Just great fun – it is hard to be stuffy when you are wearing a harness and helment, and people are flying over your head on the zipline screaming. Following the fun we had the standard silent auction, dinner, and live auction, proceeds to beneift the Outward Bound scholarship program. Just a great time, highly recommended.

				<p><p><strong>VCs and Blogs</strong>. I am pretty proud of the fact that Ignition has to be the leading VC when it comes to blog usage. Between my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com">main site</a>, my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html">Halloween site</a>, Tong’s <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">personal site</a> and <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net">geek site</a>, and soon to come Zagula, Adrian, Steve, and Michelle, we have to be the most aggressive users of blogs in the VC community.</p>

<p>Probably goes back to our Microsoft training with its “dogfooding” mentality – if you expect customers to use this stuff, you better be willing to use it yourself. Tho Adrian is not a ‘soft alum and he has the same mentality – he led half of Ignition in building their own <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net/smith/Cantenna/Cantenna.htm">802.11 cantennas</a>!</p>

<p>I am proud of the fact that we are hands on and experimental. Shows through in the kinds of companies we invest in and how we work with them. And makes us much more able to do our job – Tong and I can do a much better job on software due diligence, having screwed around with PHP and Perl and MySQL and ASP ourselves.</p>

				<p><p><strong>BCS Calcs.</strong> <a href="http://www.chrisblanchard.com/2002_11_17_sportsarchive.html#84829091">Chris’s view</a> on the math of the BCS. Which I totally get, that is the right mathematical explanation. But it just points out to me what a dumb system it is – it is just not sensible for a team to be “penalized” for playing and winning, relative to a team that is idle. Maybe Ohio State was too high last week, and are at their “right” level now, but the system is just goofy. It doesn’t really matter if Ohio State wins out but I am sure there are situations in which it would matter.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How it Changed the World</strong>. I’m enjoying this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375412301/qid=1037941349/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7929887-9967955?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">book</a> and am just a chapter in. A good argument to start that the US has been far more active in foreign policy, and to far better effect, than we generally recognize. My favorite quote: <em>“The United States, on such a view, is the Mr. Magoo of the world community.”</em></p>
