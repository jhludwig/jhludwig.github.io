</ul>

<p>Re the last book, I’ve been reflecting on science fiction as a genre. In recent weeks I’ve been feeling bad about the genre as writer after writer dismisses it in the NY Times – <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/books/review/daniel-silva-by-the-book.html">Daniel Silva</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/books/review/terry-mcmillan-by-the-book.html">Terry McMillan</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/books/review/jeffrey-toobin-by-the-book.html">Jeffrey Toobin</a>. One can argue that I shouldn’t care about these opinions, but still. One aspect I think these writers miss is the ability of speculative fiction to explore the societal impacts of technology, as I note in the book above, and I find this to be valuable and interesting.</p>

<p>I was also feeling a little annoyed at these writers for their blanket dismissal of a genre, that didn’t seem very clever to me. I was happy to read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/alan-moore-by-the-book.html">Alan Moore</a> this week, who just nails the key point that genre doesn’t have to be limiting at all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m happiest when I’m outside it altogether, or perhaps more accurately, when I can conjure multiple genres all at once, in accordance with my theory (now available, I believe, as a greeting card and fridge magnet) that human life as we experience it is a simultaneous multiplicity of genres. I put it much more elegantly on the magnet. With that said, of course, there are considerable pleasures to be found in genre, foremost among which is that of either violating or transcending it, assuming there’s a difference, and using it to talk about something else entirely. Some subversions, paradoxically, can even seem to reinvigorate the stale conventions that they’d set out to subvert or satirize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every genre has bad writing, and bad genre writing is bad. I am going to dedicate myself to reading good genre reading, and especially writing that pushes the boundaries of the genre.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">29 August 2016</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/561187904071636">Facebook open-sourced</a> its <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/deepmask">Deepmask and Sharpmask</a> codebases last week for object segmentation in a scene. In the past I’ve tried traditional CV methods to do object masking, and it is kind of a disaster, you end up with a very finicky codebase full of heuristics and hacks, which fails as soon as it sees a new kind of image. Seems like an archetypical use case for neural nets. So seemed worth giving it a try.</p>

<p>Deepmask and Sharpmask come with pretrained models based on the <a href="http://mscoco.org/">COCO dataset</a>, it looks laborious to label a new dataset without benefit of some mechanical turk-like process, so I decided to stick with the pretrained models.</p>

<p>To avoid polluting my system, and to share with the rest of the team, I decided to bring this all up in a docker container. Because our build environment has some unique characteristics, I needed to author my own container, but these were excellent dockerfile guides: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kaixhin/cuda-torch/~/dockerfile/">Torch with CUDA</a> and it’s <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kaixhin/cuda-torch-deps/~/dockerfile/">dependencies</a>. Also <a href="https://github.com/torch/distro">Torch install</a> is a good reference.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/weekend-software-experiment-facebooks-deepmask/29-aug-2016-04-13-54/"><img src="images/29-Aug-2016-04-13-54.jpg" alt="29-Aug-2016-04-13-54" /></a></p>

<p>First results in the picture. Did a nice job on this image for the large objects. The biggest problem I had was running out of GPU memory. The machine I was using only had 4G of video ram and this constrains how large an image you can feed in. We had a bunch of 4K x 3K street images, I found that scaling them down to 756x567 allowed me to get them thru the classifier. My modified classifier that implements a size limit is <a href="https://gist.github.com/jhludwig/9d17d8c7abd2822f863ca8256ec3a82f">here</a></p>

<p>The classifier is slow, seconds to tag an image. It would be interesting to keep it resident as a demon, and to just emit the metadata instead of a modified image, and see if I could get a higher framerate. Also I want to play around with both a faster video card, as well as maybe an opencl implementation to get to non-cuda platforms. This is also my first lua code ever, I have no idea which part of this code is fast or slow.</p>

<p>This was a fun little project. It points out that, if software is eating the world, then ML is eating software. For a certain class of problems, a fairly generic neural net plus a dataset is going to be competitive with the best laboriously hand-coded algorithm.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/weekend-gadget-review-the-cocoon-not-recommended">Weekend gadget review -- the Cocoon -- not recommended</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">27 August 2016</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>This morning I set up the <a href="https://cocoon.life/">Cocoon</a> I received this week – “Protect your whole home with Cocoon. Simple setup, HD video and audio, built-in siren, all controlled from your phone. Feel safe with Cocoon.”</p>

<p>Unboxing and setup – <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/weekend-gadget-review-the-cocoon-not-recommended/cocoon-box/"><img src="images/cocoon-box-300x193.jpg" alt="cocoon box" /></a>pretty standard box quality, nothing special about. Inside the box you get the Cocoon, usb cable and wall wart, some clunky international adapters, a stand, and a very small manual. While the manual was small, it was complete and clear.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/weekend-gadget-review-the-cocoon-not-recommended/cocoon-elements/"><img src="images/cocoon-elements-300x182.jpg" alt="cocoon elements" /></a>For wifi setup the Cocoon uses an audio scheme – the Cocoon app on your phone blurts a song out which the Cocoon listens to for embedded wifi credentials. It was pleasant and fast, and way better than a bluetooth dance or a private wifi hotspot dance. Up and running in minutes, this promise was met.</p>

<p>Apparently the Cocoon will use location services and when it knows you are out of the house (ie when your phone is out of the house), will “arm” itself and start watching for movement and listening for sounds. It will then alert you to anything, and you can connect to see the video snippets, and set off the alarm if you want (or call the police or whatever). I didn’t exhaustively check all this out, I mostly just played with the video.</p>

<p>And, well, video as a data type is hard. So many bits. So opaque. The promised “HD video” was not really HD, was very laggy (my guess is they are using something like HLS or DASH which guarantees lag), was corrupted at times, had a low framerate, sometimes didn’t show up over the LTE connection. I’d say that the Canary I’ve used in the past had better video.<br />
<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/weekend-gadget-review-the-cocoon-not-recommended/cocoon-subsound/"><img src="images/cocoon-subsound-169x300.jpg" alt="cocoon subsound" /></a> The Cocoon also has some feature called Subsound. I could not tell from the app screen what this was supposed to be doing. The website says it uses an infrasound microphone, geolocation, and machine learning. You can only see the app screen if you are at home. I guess this is to detect a broader array of movement or sound.</p>

<p>So…this is fairly expensive device. But with poor video. And a bag of other features which seem ok but not amazing. The economics on this thing are challenging to justify, if you want to see what’s going on in your home, a raspberry pi based system would be FAR cheaper tho of course you would have to futz with it yourself. The big downfall of this device is the poor video experience, at $400 I expect something pretty freaking amazing.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>My best two investments this year have been NVDA and ARMH. NVDA’s been on fire, it was obvious when I attended their GPU Tech Conference that they were going to do very well this year. And Softbank’s play for ARMH has been rewarding.</p>

<p>All the growth in compute usage and capability has moved to non-Intel processor cores — GPU and ARM, both of which are better in different ways for the high growth compute issues of the day. Hard to imagine this changing, I’d expect to see even more GPU migration (or even on to FPGAs).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12507568/intel-arm-mobile-chips-licensing-deal-idf-2016">INTC’s ARM licensing move</a> is a sign that intel is fully accepting the reality here. I am sure Intel still has a lot of internal religion about x86 instruction set – but they shouldn’t hold back now. They should fully cast aside any religion about instruction sets, and just make sure everyone is opting to put an Intel part everywhere. Put an ARM core on every x86 processor — they certainly have the transistors, it would be great as a developer to have an ARM core at my disposal on my laptop. Put an x86 core on every ARM chip, it would be great to be able to use x86 code in more places.</p>

<p>Softbank meanwhile may have just enabled their biggest competitor. It is great to have Intel as a licensee, but there is no way Intel is going to accept a secondary position in the processor market, they are going to use their design skills and fab skills to try to coopt the ARM market. Softbank will need to ramp up their own ARM ecosystem efforts, probably with a deeper software and services play, or they are going to find themselves with less and less influence.</p>

				<p><p>Google has announced <a href="https://developers.google.com/brillo/">Brillo</a> which leverages Android and Linux. But no, wait, now there is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/13/google-fuchsia-operating-system/">Google Fuchsia</a> because apparently Linux isn’t good enough. On the pi there are a jillion variants of linux to use, but with glaring holes (general purpose gpu, docker for instance). ARM has <a href="https://www.mbed.com/en/platform/mbed-os/">mbed</a> tho it is really targetted at low end devices. You can try <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot">Windows 10</a>. And all of these require a lot of laborious tinkering.</p>

<p>To say nothing of the cloud, the services for managing ARM devices are even more nascent or non-existent.</p>

<p>You have to wonder what Softbank is going to do about this. A $32B hardware bet needs a corresponding software and services bet.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="https://twitter.com/natbro">Nat</a> reminds me that I didn’t even mention toolchains! Cross-compilers, QEMU, etc – there is so much fun in here!</p>

				<p><p>Comcast must love our household. We have to be in the top tier of cable subscribers – multiple TVs, all DVRs, the most premium and sports channels we can get. Partly inertia, partly because we have been economically fortunate, partly because I want to get all the live HD football I can get. Comcast marketers must sit around salivating about us and wondering how to create more customers like us (or at least hang on to us).</p>

<p>So why is the Comcast/NBC Olympics coverage the worst possible option for viewing live Olympics? The 100M dash was what finally killed me. CBUT had it live. I could have found it on streaming live. NBC and Comcast in their infinite wisdom showed it at who knows what time last night. NBC had far more important things to show like prelim heats of some 800M race, also probably on tape delay. We found 5 minutes of worthwhile content in the first two hours of NBC Olympic coverage, thank goodness we could fast forward through it all.</p>

<p>By any measure the traditional cable NBC Olympics viewing is the worst possible option, which is so strange given the pile of money I give Comcast each month. The clear message is “If you want to watch live Olympics, you should not choose NBC or a cable subscription”. <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2014/02/comcast_merger_editorial_carto.html">Comcast why would you treat your best customer this way?</a></p>
