  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guest-Room-Vintage-Contemporaries/dp/0804170983">The Guest Room</a> by Chris Bohjalian.  Sad story about human trafficking and its victims, wrapped up inside a suspense novel.  A little uncomfortable at times, human trafficking is an ugly business.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bring-Me-Back-B-Paris/dp/1250151333">Bring Me Back</a> by B. A.

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Army-None-Autonomous-Weapons-Future/dp/0393608980">Army of None</a> by Paul Scharre,  An examination of the issues around autonomous weapons.  Mixed feelings.  Some of the writing is very clumsy, but the discussion of the human/weapons systems integration issues are interesting.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-York-2140-Stanley-Robinson-ebook/dp/B01KT7YTO6">New York 2140</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson.  I don’t think Robinson is a great story teller or a great builder of characters, and the book was overly long, but still an interesting exploration of what our lives might be like 100+ years from now as we deal with climate change.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Trump-Touches-Dies-Republican/dp/1982103124">Everything Trump Touches Dies</a> by Rick Wilson.  This quote near the end says it all:  “<em>Everything about Donald Trump’s presidency and character is a disaster for America.  The victories Republicans think they have achieved are transitory and ephemeral and come at the cost of their principles and, probably, their immortal souls.  He is a stain on the party, on conservatism, and on this country that won’t easily wash out.</em>“  And that is the most temperate thing Wilson says about Trump.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Naomi-Alderman-ebook/dp/B01N0Z1EY0/">The Power</a> by Naomi Alderman.  No real surprise here – absolute power corrupts absolutely, regardless of who has it.  The book is solid but over-hyped.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Capitalism-Age-Big-Data-ebook/dp/B072MF2NQJ/">Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data</a> by Viktoe Mayer-Schönberger and Thomas Ramge.  Ok the very first example in this book pissed me off and I set the book down.  Talking about a cookware purchase, the author describes a magical future where some system knows all your preferences and purchase history and just magically selects the right item for you in seconds.  And this seems like horseshit as it completely devalues design, ignores the fact that some people like shopping, ignores the value of the shopping process itself, etc.  I just didn’t care enough to read another page.  The book gets nice reviews tho.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Imperial-Twilight-Opium-Chinas-Golden-ebook/dp/B074YK9NHS">Imperial Twilight</a> by Stephen R. Platt.   The story of the Opium War.  Well written and much to learn here.  And what a great contrast to the book above.  The pop business book spins some BS tale about how humans will behave.  The deep history book examines exactly how humans did behave and reasons about how that will apply in the future.  The history book is way more insightful.</li>

<p>CSNY pushed that record out in 3 weeks.  They were at the top of their careers, already had an album for sale, but they didn’t play it safe, they made an emotional statement that resonates to this day.   I was quite young, but this event hit me hard and contributed to my suspicion of authority and power.</p>

<p>We have terrible issues in society today.  Gun violence and school shootings affecting many more people.  Inhumane treatment of desperate people at our borders.  None of the artists of today want my opinion – but too often I see artists talking at rallies and events, but it is their art that is impactful and emotional, and they could be more effective in reaching us if they spoke through their art.</p>

<p>One artist that is doing it today is Donald Glover – if you haven’t seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY">Childish Gambino - This Is America (Official Video)</a>, you should.  It is hard to watch.  I am sure there are others.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Originals-How-Non-Conformists-Move-World-ebook/dp/B00XIYGCDO">Originals</a> by Adam Grant.  I expected to hate this as I tend not to enjoy pop business books, or books that justify people being jerks.  But it was better than that.  Useful tools for encouraging creativity in yourself and your teams.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Awkward-Thoughts-Kamau-Bell-Heterosexual-ebook/dp/B01LZXZK2F">The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell</a> by W. Kamau Bell. Interesting story of a developing comic and his experiences with racism. I need to watch his show on CNN.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Awful-Observations-Matt-Bellassai-ebook/dp/B071CTJX14">Everything is Awful</a> by Matt Bellassai.  Another book by a comic, and this one is thin gruel after reading Bell above.  Couldn’t finish, seemed so lightweight.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nanoscale-Communication-Networks-Science-Engineering/dp/1608070034">Nanoscale Communication Networks</a> by Stephen F. Bush.  From 2010, so in this field this is like a billion years old,  but still interesting.  Transport mechanisms, delay characteristics, accuracy are so different at the nanoscale.</li>
</ul>

J. Fikry</a> by Gabrielle Zevin. I picked this up at random on Independent Bookstore Day at <a href="https://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Bookstore</a>.  Fantastic hopeful book about loss and love.  Great characters.  Very glad I took the chance – what I really like about independent bookstores is their “staff picks” area.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/March-Book-One-John-Lewis-ebook/dp/B00CTBU3NC">March</a> by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, Nate Powell.  Great graphic novel about the life of John Lewis.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amatka-Karin-Tidbeck-ebook/dp/B0716GNTTG">Amatka</a> by Karen Tidbeck.  Another Independent Bookstore Day purchase.  A town whose very existence is defined and controlled by language, and what happens as some of the residents start to rebel against control and language.  A little trippy but I enjoy tales like these.</li>

				<p><p>A great launch yesterday – <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b29aa2fb-5bb2-356c-8fac-6fa51b767a69/%5B%24%24%5D-docusign-shows-strong.html\">Docusign IPO.</a></p>

<p>Congrats to everyone there.  And a big congrats and thanks to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jonathan-roberts">JonRo</a> who unflaggingly championed and supported the company through every zig and zag.  He taught me such valuable investment lessons about persistence and about survival – he stuck with Docusign (and other investments) through every dip, through every tough spot, as they went in and out of fashion, and it all ultimately paid off for Docusign and Ignition investors.  Thanks Jon.</p>
