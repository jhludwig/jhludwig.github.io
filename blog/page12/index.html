			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I am so saddened and angered about the Parkland shooting. I work with a colleague who lost his child. I have been useless in the last week processing this.</p>

<p>I’ve sat by year after year as these shootings have happened and done nothing. I need to do my part, I need to speak up, I need to take whatever action I can.</p>

<p>I will demand to my representatives that we try to address these shootings. And I am open to trials on many fronts. Reasonable restrictions on assault rifles, let’s try it. More mental health support, let’s try it. Hardening schools, let’s try it. I have my own beliefs about which of these will be most effective (restrictions on assault rifles), but I support any steps that address the shootings, and preferably a basket of steps. Let’s try them all, measure how they do, and try again. The exact steps are not important — it is the repeated trying that matters.</p>

<p>I will demand to my local and state representatives that we try things locally. Don’t try to “boil the ocean” at the Federal level. Start at the state and local level. That is how the country made progress on LGBT rights.</p>

<p>I will support candidates who refuse to take gun lobby money. I want candidates who work on behalf of citizens, not the gun lobby.</p>

<p>We each need to decide how we are going to react to these shootings. I will speak my feelings, and I will demand that we try policies to address the problem, and that we repeatedly try.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Bolt-Vol-Hard-Time/dp/1302907328">Black Bolt</a> by Saladin Ahmed.  I dip into graphic novels every once in a while to see what is up.  This one got great reviews.  It was just ok for me, a little difficult to relate to the characters or situation.</li>

This book has had a lot of buzz, but it is very tiresome.  Some interesting observations but wrapped up in wooden repetitive prose.  The language and story aren’t good enough to make this book widely popular, and the data is too thin for a really technical book.  I resorted to just reading the topic sentences of paragraphs and trying to make do with that.</li>

But the pace is good, the iPad app really helped run the game, and once we realized that going “insane” in the game opened up play quite a bit, we had a lot of fun.  Definitely recommended.  Not a short game tho.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/King-Tokyo-New-Board-Game/dp/B01F46RPS4">King of Tokyo</a> – super fast to play, easy gameplay, and the game can shift dramatically in seconds.  Also recommended, and you can fly through a game.</p>

<p>A disappointment was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bezier-Games-ONUWBEZ-Ultimate-Werewolf/dp/B00HS7GG5G">One Night Werewolf</a>.  Maybe we needed more eggnog.  With 5 people, it seemed like the outcomes were obvious.  Maybe we were doing it wrong.</p>

				<p><p>We don’t hunt but we like to observe the critters around us.  Trying out the <a href="http://bushnell.com/wildlife/trail-cameras/trophy-cam/trophy-cam-hd-aggressor-wireless">Bushnell Aggressor</a> – no idea if it is the best, but got decent reviews, and we wanted the cellular capability.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2017/12/trying-out-a-game-camera-didnt-realize-how-varied-this-segment-was/ff4dbe6b-dcc1-4623-baf5-13a948f0ddd8/"><img src="images/ff4dbe6b-dcc1-4623-baf5-13a948f0ddd8-300x225.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Bushnell offers its own portal at <a href="http://www.wirelesstrophycam.com">wirelesstrophycam.com</a> and also includes a trial offer for <a href="http://deerlab.com/bushnell">Deerlab</a> which seems to have a bunch more features.  The device also comes with a 30 day wireless trial plan and notifies via text or email of new captures, and apparently you can extend the data plan without a contract which is nice..  It can be configured to capture video or pictures as desired.  It uses an impressive 12 AA batteries but apparently can also be hooked up to a solar panel.</p>

<p>The first critter it spotted is not surprising or particularly alarming!  I will deploy it in a location more likely to see deer, otter, mink, etc in the future.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jane-Unlimited-Kristin-Cashore-ebook/dp/B01MY28M5P">Jane, Unlimited</a> by Kristin Cashore.  Good reviews but ugh, choppy and poorly developed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Not-Sound-Thriller-Heather-Gudenkauf-ebook/dp/B01M8M9IW1">Not A Sound</a> by Heather Gudenkauf.  Solid thriller – a deaf woman stumbles into a mystery, and increasingly learns that those closest to her may be involved.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Function-Language-Novel-ebook/dp/B01NARGQEU">The Seventh Function of Language</a> by Laurent Binet.  Great book, man did this make me feel uneducated – the art, literature, and culture references flew by me, but well written.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Woman-Walking-Sharon-Bolton-ebook/dp/B06VV8ZRWP">Dead Woman Walking</a> by Sharon Bolton.  Nice thriller set in Scottish border lands with some excellent twists.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical-ebook/dp/B00G3L6JQ4">How Not To Be Wrong</a> by Jordan Ellenberg.  Great discussion of practical math and statistics and how they impact our everyday life.  Really good.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Their-Own-Land-Mourning-ebook/dp/B01EEQ9BSW">Strangers In Their Own Land</a> by Arlie Russell Hochschild.  Another “how does the conservative right think” book.  Useful to try to build empathy.  Let’s hope that the conservative right are reading the equivalent books.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Viking-Economics-How-Scandinavians-Right-ebook/dp/B017QLQ8A6">Viking Economics</a> by George Lakey.  A bit gushing, but still a solid read about Nordic economies and values, and what we can learn from them.  A core point that resonated with me – the Nordic countries have embraced “investing in our people” as a core principle, and a lot of policy decisions stem from that.  This does not seem like a bad idea.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forest-Dark-Novel-Nicole-Krauss-ebook/dp/B01N6IHCSA">Forest Dark</a> by Nicole Krauss.  If I knew more about Judaism and about Kafka, I would probably love this.  It was engaging but I was just missing too much due to my ignorance.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27419654-the-last-girl">The Last Girl</a> by Joe Hart.  Yet another post-apocalyptic tale where women have it bad.  This doesn’t really contribute much to the genre</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29090844-the-stars-are-legion">The Stars are Legion</a> by Kameron Hurley.  Some far distant future where technology and biology and humanity are completely intertwined.  Just OK.</li>

				<p><p>Between <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/09/18/ccleaner-cybersecurity-app-infected-with-backdoor/#39607ff7316a">this news</a> and the Kapersky revelations last week, I think the strategy most people should follow for their personal pcs is clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t visit sketchy sites that are offering you free software, free movies, etc.  And never download software offering the same.  ”If you aren’t the customer, you are the product.”</li>
  <li>Don’t install 3rd party AV/Security software, this software digs into the heart of your system and just creates another source of vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li>Do accept all patches from your OS vendor – Microsoft or Apple. You should probably allow them to auto patch your system without your intervention.  You have already thrown your lot in with them, why hold back.</li>
  <li>Do run the latest OS from your OS vendor.  That is where their best and brightest people are working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft and Apple have a gajillion people working on security, it is in their interest to protect their products from attacks, you should align yourself with them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Big-John-Crowley-ebook/dp/B005DB7O0U">Little, Big</a> by John Crowley. Well-regarded and I enjoyed some of the characters, but it lost me when it quickly flipped into faerie. Gave up on.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2017/06/recent-books-crowley-goldbarth-bob-hope-phenomena-raj-harry-august-tom-rob-smith-etc/books-bob_hope_biography-0fd28/"><img src="images/Books-Bob_Hope_Biography-0fd28-198x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Form-Content-Essays/dp/1555977618">The Adventures of Form and Content</a> by Albert Goldbarth. Goldbarth can be challenging but these are excellent essays. I aspire to be as well-read and thoughtful as he is.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Entertainer-Century-Richard-Zoglin-ebook/dp/B00IWTWTFK">Hope</a> by Richard Zoglin. I never thought I’d be interested in a biography of Bob Hope, but a fascinating life story. He was an absolutely dominant entertainer in almost all forms of popular media, and could be incredibly generous, and yet had massive massive flaws. An interesting human being.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phenomena-Governments-Investigations-Extrasensory-Psychokinesis-ebook/dp/B01HZFB2T0">Phenomena</a> by Annie Jacobsen. Got great reviews but the nonsense discussed drove me away. Gave up on.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Empire-British-Conquest-India-ebook/dp/B01IMZ5GFI">The Chaos of Empire</a> by Jon Wilson. Another I abandoned quickly. From past readings I’ve know the British were none too pleasant as they built their empire, and I wanted to learn more, but the early parts of this book just droned on and on with no insight.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farm-Tom-Rob-Smith-ebook/dp/B00FPQCWR8">The Farm</a> by Tom Rob Smith. His earlier books are excellent, but he just never found his voice in this one. A satisfying ending but not a great read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Fifteen-Lives-Harry-August-ebook/dp/B00ECE9OD4">The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</a> by Claire North. Fun. Not memorable but fun.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Orbit-Carolyn-Ives-Gilman-ebook/dp/B00R697BMS">Dark Orbit</a> by Carolyn Ives Gilman. My Kindle says I read this, and the Amazon blurb sounds familiar, but for the life of me, I couldn’t tell you anything about. Read whatever you want to into this.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Graves-Full-Jamie-Mason-ebook/dp/B008J2AEQG">Three Graves Full</a> by Jamie Mason. An attempt at a Fargo-like tale but eh. Not funny enough.</li>

				<p><p>My workflow for years on my MBP has centered on VMWare running Debian/Ubuntu, and all my tools in the VM.</p>

<p>For developing code targeting AWS services, I thought I’d try using Docker for Mac and running Debian images with Docker.</p>

<p>Well that didn’t work. <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/time-in-container-is-out-of-sync/16566">This bug involving time drift in a container</a> has been around for a year now, with no attention paid to it. It basically makes it impossible to access any AWS services. I have to conclude that no one is actually using Docker for Mac.</p>

<p>I’ve also for years used a variety of editors and IDEs on both the Mac and Linux side. I heard such good things about VSCode that I decided to try it. But after any amount of time running it, it starts to miss keystrokes – I first noticed it wasn’t responding to copy/paste from the keyboard, then it also started to fail on simple text entry. I have no time for this, as cool as VSCode may be, it fails on the fundamentals.</p>

				<p><p>Created a site using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar">Codestar</a>. It was pretty easy (the ssh setup instructions are the trickiest thing, they are not perfectly clear). And I like that the resultant site embraces AWS cloud services. But in its drive to easy dev, codestar masks what is going on under the covers, and I am left with a site that I don’t really know how to modify and extend because I don’t understand what has happened beneath me. I doubt I will use it much.</p>

<p>UPDATE: If you think of codestar as just a way to seed a project, it is kind of useful. it would have taken me a while to correctly configure IAM, CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CloudFormation, and Lambda. A tool to seed a project with all this correctly set up is useful. I wish that the tool would emit a script to let me idempotently recreate the project from scratch including all IAM settings.</p>
