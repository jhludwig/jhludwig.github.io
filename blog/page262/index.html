				<p><p><strong>Boating</strong>. The great weather makes me want to get out on a boat. And we live in a great area for it. Thankfully there is no reason to actually own a boat.

A huge range of pricing, amenities, crew options, etc. Waaaay cheaper than actually owning a boat.</p>

<p>Someday I’d like to do a charter in other parts of the world. From some of these sites you can see the market for charters in other areas, and clearly the mediterranean and caribean are active markets. I have a dream of doing Australia by boat someday…</p>

				<p><p><strong>Small Camera</strong>. Here’s a <a href="http://www.dynamism.com/cubik/index.shtml">cool small camera</a>.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder about the limit to size of a camera. As moore’s law drives down the size of necessary circuitry, I guess the limits to size are a) batteries, b) lens structure, and c) control surfaces. I would have in the past said storage media was a driver of size but no more, not with solid state media. Lens structure is a feature decision – how much optical zoom, size do you want. I bet batteries can get very small as designers go to low power circuits. These cameras are going to get very very small….</p>

				<p><p><strong>Relatives</strong>. A fun game to play on the net is to see what you can find out about your relatives. Extra points for obscurity. Not an exhaustive list below but some fun things I found out about my relatives:</p>

<p>Grandfather Cleo is a great supporter of the <a href="http://www.ohio4h.org/4hfoundation/histsupp.htm">4-H organization:</a> “4-H gave me an opportunity for accomplishment, boosted my ego and brought me out of my shell of shyness and unworthiness.” – Cleo Ludwig, Founder, L &amp; K Restaurants.</p>

<p>Sister Laura is easy to find – tons of mentions due to her job at the <a href="http://www.state.oh.us/odps/division/ems/ems_local/default.htm">Ohio Department of Public Safety</a>. Ditto Cousin <a href="http://www.bcschools.net/Administration.html">Carolyn</a>.</p>

<p>Cousin John had a stint with the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/all_time_stats/players/c/5382/">Reds</a>! Cool.</p>

<p>Cousin Susan’s efforts are apparently appreciated by the <a href="http://www.fcdp.org/office.html">Franklin Country Democrats</a>. While her husband Erick is a member in good standing of the <a href="http://home.columbus.rr.com/buckeyebeemers/reports/0002.member.html">Buckeye Beemers</a>.</p>

<p>Brother-in-law Garry Curren is on the <a href="http://www.heidelberg.edu/athletics/football/alltimeoac.html">all-time all-OAC team</a>! And is a heck of a <a href="http://www.michiganvizsla.org/w98idx.htm">dog trainer</a>. Speaking of dogs, <a href="http://www.marioncomputer.com/hutchman/">Aunt Carrie</a> is a huge dog lover too.</p>

<p>Check out the high school/middle school photo of Dad – <a href="http://www.geocities.com/schrade9/">Pictures</a>, near the bottom of the page, open the one named Paul Ludwig (if you can’t find it there, try <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Images/young%20paul.bmp">here</a>). And the <a href="http://www.pixi.com/~jharbin/classmates_58.html">high school pics</a> of Rosemary and Garry!</p>

<p>No picture for Mom, but she and dad are appreciated by the <a href="http://www.unitedwaymarion.org/bronze.htm">United Way</a>.</p>

<p>Cousin Rob is well known in <a href="http://www.norwalkoh.com/industries.html">Norwalk</a> – home of the <a href="http://www.henhouseinc.com/">Hen House</a>.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>College entrance exams</strong>. Rant. Kids these days are expected to take the PSAT in their junior year to qualify for National Merit honors. SAT in the spring of their junior year for the first time. Followed by prep work, and then the SAT again in the fall of their senior year. AP tests for appropriate classes at the end of their junior year, which could mean as many as 4 more tests. SAT II tests in 3 subject areas at the end of their junior year, followed by retesting in their senior year if they feel appropriate. Some people recommend the ACT test as well as it biases in slightly different directions.</p>

<p>Issue A. The amount of time and work spent on these tests is huge. And if you want to do any prep at all, it really eats up time.</p>

<p>Issue B. The notion that a small set of numbers somehow measures a person’s potential is of course nuts.</p>

<p>Each of these tests also has all kinds of scoring options – extra cost options for faster score reporting, more detailed reporting.</p>

<p>Issue C. The system explicitly favors higher income families – retesting, prep, scoring options all add up. I guess I shouldn’t complain as this biases the system towards us but it is not right.</p>

<p>Disturbing.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">08 April 2002</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>Remote Access to my network</strong>. OK I have started this past weekend on a simple adventure. I want to be able to see the files on my home machine from my desk at my office. And I want to do so securely – IE I don’t want the rest of the planet to be able to easily monkey with my files.</p>

<p>I considered a lot of different solutions – writing a custom website to frontend my files, using pc anywhere, using the winxp remote desktop feature, putting my file server at home in the dmz of my firewall. I had a recent good experience with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/using/howto/gomobile/vpns.asp">Win XP VPN client</a> tho, it is substantially easier to use than previous versions and it is included in Win XP. And with a VPN I can keep my file server behind my firewall, and I can put the VPN server behind my firewall. And I happened to have an underutilized Win2k server box so I decided to turn it into a VPN server using the included VPN software.</p>

<p>So in I dove. I will save you all the details. Along the way I had to add another net card, reconfig my firewall to pass traffic through to the vpn server, and configure a vpn server on the win2k box. There are a lot of moving parts involved. As of this moment, I am now reformatting my WIn2k box and reinstalling the server on it, as in my first attempt I ended up with an unbootable win2k server. There are a lot of conflicting docs on the Microsoft Technet site about how to set this up right. The user interface is pretty daunting.</p>

<p>Once I have it working I will post my steps and advice up here. But for now I am deep in the bowels of Win2k Server Setup…</p>

<p>Update. Server Set up. SP2 installed. Currently installing all security patches.</p>

				<!-- <p><p><strong>Remote Access to my network</strong>. OK I have started this past weekend on a simple adventure. I want to be able to see the files on my home machine from my desk at my office. And I want to do so securely – IE I don’t want the rest of the planet to be able to easily monkey with my files.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Educational Update</strong>. Liz and I had a great college tour this week. We started at the UW visiting their <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwhonors/">honors program</a>, where Liz was able to sit in on an ecology class. The honors staff was super nice and accomodating and the UW is a great hometown choice.</p>

<p>Then down to Southern Cal for a whirlwind tour through <a href="http://www.oxy.edu">Oxy</a>, <a href="http://www.pomona.edu/">Pomona</a> and the rest of the <a href="http://www.cuc.claremont.edu/">Claremont</a> schools, <a href="http://www.pepperdine.edu">Pepperdine</a>, and <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/">Cal Tech</a>.</p>

<p>Liz liked Pomona. We had a great tour led by a young man in the freshman class – we saw all the dorms, the dining areas, some of the classrooms. Very small classes, nice dorms, beautiful Mission+Georgian architecture (my analysis – I am sure real architects would describe differently), a strong sciences program, an extensive outdoors program. And a small school but with the facilities of a larger university since it is part of the Claremont consortium. And <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&amp;address=&amp;city=claremont&amp;state=ca&amp;zipcode=&amp;homesubmit.x=40&amp;homesubmit.y=16">Claremont</a> is a pleasant suburban setting and very close to Ontario airport.</p>

<p>Caltech is also a beautiful campus but we didn’t have a chance to visit classes. But worth applying to, obviously a great sciences tradition.</p>

<p>Pepperdine and Oxy are also both great schools. Beautiful albeit very different settings – Pepperdine in Malibu has just a stupendous view. Oxy may be a little weaker on the sciences, though it has a good program and all the people we met were great. Pepperdine has some great new science facilities including a really cool marine biology lab. We met the Natural Sciences department head while at Pepperdine and she was very nice, setting us up with a lab tour with one of the biology professors. All these schools were super friendly and accomodating.</p>

<p>Liz did very well on her SATs, particularly her math, so she feels like she has a great chance of getting in most of these schools, so we feel very good about her choices. We are going to try to slip down and see classes and dorms at Reed in a couple weeks as a point of comparison. That will give Liz all the data she needs to decide over the summer the set of schools to which she applies (I am clearly not an English major, I am sure I could have structured that sentence better).</p>

<p>John has his own exciting academic news. His teachers recommended last week that he skip ahead next year to 8th grade math along with 4 other of his classmates. He is very excited about this, this means he will take Algebra next year, Geometry in 8th grade, and then move into Honors/AP Algebra II, Precal, Calculus, etc in high school. Liz also skipped ahead a year in math during high school and it has helped her a lot in terms of SAT scores, etc. So this seems like a great move (and much better than trying to skip an entire grade which we think can put certain kids at a social disadvantage sometimes).</p>

<p>This week John is not in school but is on what is called “Project Week”. His project this year is Filipino Culture and he is spending the week at various locations around Seattle learning about the subject. This wasn’t his first choice of project! But one of his friends is on the team with him, and they get to eat lots of good food, so I am sure they will have fun. The weather is beautiful here today so being out and about in the city won’t be a burden.</p>
