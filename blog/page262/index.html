				<p><p><strong>Halloween Preps</strong>. After much deliberation I’ve settled on my projects for this year. I am a) going to beef up my lightning primarily by switching to blue photo floodlights as discussed on <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html">my halloween blog</a>. B) I am going to try my hand at a small axworthy ghost project, drawing inspiration from some of the more <a href="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/urmyslav/page1.html?mtbrand=AOL_US"></a>extreme setups out there. I’ve tracked down a motor and am going to start laying out all the gear i need this weekend. c) i am going to build a small <a href="http://members.accesstoledo.com/kkrazykkaren/Floating/Lantern.html">flying lantern</a> setup. i’ve also gotten my cheap mirror ball motor for this and am going to start getting the rest of the gear this weekend.</p>

<p>There are some minor other things I want to do but these are the longer leadtime items. I’ll try to post pictures as I make progress.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>RealNames</strong>. Lots of press about <a href="http://www.realnames.com/body/home.asp">Realnames</a> going out of business – for instance at <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/05/12">Scripting News</a>. Most of it very anti-Microsoft. I think <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/23/25245.html">The Register</a> has it right tho. Actually maybe the tide is turning – <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a> has it right too.</p>

<p>Realnames is dying because a) it has very little utility for most end users. Search engines and autocomplete in the browser make it pretty easy to find things. b) it has little utility and lots of cost for site developers. It doesn’t make it that much easier to find my site (see a) and it costs me money. c) it has little utility for advertisers. They already have to put URLs and AOL keywords in their ads. Neither of these are going away. Why put in a 3rd that has less coverage than either of the prior two?</p>

<p>It is easy to point a finger at Microsoft and say they are to blame. But Microsoft did a deal with Realnames at a time when other large players did not – where was AOL? A merger of AOL keywords and Realnames might have made sense, by providing a common name across the internet and the AOL service.</p>

<p>Had the service been incredibly compelling I am sure lots of deals would have occured. But the bottom line is the service didn’t solve that many problems. I just did a quick check on google. Searching for “Ignition” – first several hits were relevant. Searching for “Ignition Venture” or “Ignition Seattle” – first hit was dead on our home page. When we set up our homepage I considered getting a Realname – but given the experience above, I couldn’t ever justify the cost. I think most people did the same math.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Jamie Kellner, chairman and CEO of Turner Broadcasting (an AOL Time Warner company), was recently interviewed by [INSIDE] on the future of television (Content’s King). In the interview, Mr. Kellner said some very interesting things, including characterizing those who skip television commercials as thieves: [Ad skips are] theft. Your contract with the network when you get the show is you’re going to watch the spots. Otherwise you couldn’t get the show on an ad-supported basis. Any time you skip a commercial or watch the button you’re actually stealing the programming.</em></p>

				<p><p><strong>Blogger alternatives</strong>. I love blogger. I love the fact that so many people are doing useful things with it.</p>

<p>But it is clearly a tech-weenie experience. Stability is poor. There is often disagreement between blogger and me about what has been really published. I often have to whack blogger upside the head to get it to correctly publish my content. I have recommended blogger to many people but my non-tech-weenie friends find it daunting.</p>

<p>So I am on a mission to find alternatives. Looked at Movable Type – but don’t really want to install server software, I am very wary of installing even scripts on my server that come from sources I don’t know. I played with Radio some more. It shares some of the stability and tech-weenie nature of blogger.</p>

<p>Next up is citydesk from <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek Software</a>. OK I have citydesk from fogcreek installed. The article management UI is nice. Including pictures is easier than blogger. Stability seems fine so far. I will have to do some initial setup for my buds so that they don’t have to learn {$x.barf$} syntax. A possibility…</p>

				<p><p><strong>Boating</strong>. The great weather makes me want to get out on a boat. And we live in a great area for it. Thankfully there is no reason to actually own a boat. There is a great market of charter options. We’ve used <a href="http://ledgermarinecharters.com/main.htm">Ledger Marine</a> here in Seattle and had great luck. Other options I’ve noticed are <a href="http://www.penmar.com/crewed.htm">Penmar</a>, <a href="http://www.cnconnect.com/charter.html">CNI Charters</a>, <a href="http://www.bellinghamyachts.com/bys/bys_5.html">Bellingham Yacht Sales</a>, <a href="http://www.abcyachtcharters.com/">ABC</a>, <a href="http://www.starellit.com/fleet.htm">Starellit</a>, and <a href="http://www.gulfislandcharter.com/">Anacortes Yacht Charters</a>. A huge range of pricing, amenities, crew options, etc. Waaaay cheaper than actually owning a boat.</p>

<p>Someday I’d like to do a charter in other parts of the world. From some of these sites you can see the market for charters in other areas, and clearly the mediterranean and caribean are active markets. I have a dream of doing Australia by boat someday…</p>
