	<title>Software Roundup 8/31 – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="* Kiko – an ajax calendar. looks nice. Walt reviewed two others today – it’s an explosion of web calendars, it’s 1998 all over again. Not sure I understand why people will migrate to this new generation. I guess people are more trained to use web services now, and in broadband households, it is easy to always have the calendar live. * Via furrygoat, No-install.com – apps that you can put on usb keys. * Monad and WMI – cool. * Greasemonkeyed.com has like a jillion greasemonkey scripts to install. Playing around with book burro at the moment. * I am easily bought – I use a9.com frequently now. Not because it is great, but because i get another pi/2 percent discount on my amazon purchases. Same reason i got an Amazon Visa card. * Via cpumag I found Free-codecs.com and the K-lite mega codec pak – every freakin’ codec you could ever want. Videozilla looks interesting in this vein as well. * I should try viceversa to manage backups in the house. * I’m tempted to renew my MSDN sub so that I can get winfs beta – because who needs a stable filesystem? * Via geekman I found myprogs. Given my appetite for software, a community ranking site for software seems great. * also given all the software i install, why doesn’t windows have something as nice as ppm in perl for downloading addons/packages/etc? ppm is so easy. * Movable type style generator seems cool * JK on the run talks about something that i thought was just me – the impossiblity of doing system restores for tablet pcs . I have a tablet pc collecting dust for exactly this reason – after struggling through 2 system restores i gave up.
