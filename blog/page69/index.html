    <p>Less than 6 days to the game of the millenium.

    <p>I’ve totally set aside my fiction and general nonfiction reading for a while. I’m totally focused on texts to support my materials science education.</p>

<p>* “Fundamentals of Microfabrication”:amazon by Madou. Great comprehensive overview of the MEMS field, tons of info, tho pretty scattered. A good reference but hard to read. * “Micromachined Transducers Sourcebook”:amazon by Kovacs. Much more readable, but not as current. But a nice job of walking you through the basics. * “Microsystems Design”:amazon by Senturia. So far I find this to be a little less essential than the Kovacs text tho there is some unique content in here. * “Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction”:amazon by Callister. Used in undergrad materials science courses, I am reading this just to refresh myself on the basics. Very readable, I am breezing through it, tho it probably helps that I have seen all the material at least once before.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2006/11/08/credit-card-fraud-and-reverse-dns.html">Credit card fraud and reverse DNS</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>We had a credit card stolen a while back and I was just on the phone with the bank clearing up one last transaction. The vendor, <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php">Steam</a>, was claiming that the charge was valid. It took me about 2 minutes to convince the card issuer that the charge was not valid by simple reverse DNS of the IP addresses captured by Steam. Account signup happened at a location served by Adelphia (I have never been an Adelphia customer), and subsequent accesses all took place via two different Russian ISPs.</p>

<p>What surprises me is that neither Steam nor the card issuer (a huge national card issuer) was able to figure this out. It seems very automatable. And seems like card issuers could easily cut down on online fraud by looking at IP addresses – for myself, 99.99% of my transactions come from my work or home machines with fairly stable IP address histories, at least at the subdomain level. Not foolproof of course, and I do occasionally do transactions from other locations, but it seems like another good piece of info to consider when assessing the validity of a particular transaction.</p>

    <p>As I previously mentioned I’ve been taking a graduate course in MEMS design – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/10/the_asskicking_began_this_week.html" title="A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: The ass-kicking began this weekend in my re-education process">A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: The ass-kicking began this weekend in my re-education process</a> – and the analytics have been the toughest thing to recover after 20+ years out of school.</p>

<p>Midterm yesterday. Analytical problems on comb drives (involves mechanical and capacitive behaviour analysis), on MUMPS structures, etc. I can take some solace in the fact that I had an idea how to approach every problem, I got an answer down, and the youngsters didn’t get done dramatically before me – only 1-2 people out of 50 got done early. I know I blew 1 question at least tho on further thinking.</p>

<p>Fortunately no final in the class, just a team project which I am pretty excited about – good team with a set of experienced people, with expertises spanning mechanical and electrical domains.</p>

<p>Also looking at winter courses – Nanophotonics (EE 539c) or Electronic and Optical Structures of Engineering Materiials (MSE 565). The MSE course is a little more fundamental and probably my first choice.</p>

    <p>Total successes – our talking tree, the FCG, the Creature Crate. Also our surround sound systems generated a lot of volume, and the sounds i got from Sounddogs were really clean.</p>

<p>Failures – my pneuma-powered popping ghost. My “waterproof” container for the control electronics somehow got an inch of water in it. Ffffft.</p>

<p>Almost failure – the Creature Crate controller also struggled with dampness, continually shorting out. I had to apply a blower and some heatlamps to get it going.</p>

<p>Lesson for next year…all the control electronics that I placed in the garage or in the house worked perfectly. All the electronics outside struggled with dampness one way or another. I either need to</p>

<p>* house all the electronics indoors and just run power or pneuma cables outdoors. works fine for power, that is how i did my thunder &amp; lightning. not going to work great with pneuma… * make the electronics easily pluggable so i can bring them in at night and take them out in the afternoon. might be the best strategy, but kind of a pain * invest a lot in weather proofing the outside containers.</p>

<p>Crowds started out slow last night but at about 7pm traffic exploded. Last visitor at 945 and then we shut down.</p>
