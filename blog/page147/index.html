    <p><strong>Expensing Options</strong>. Reading <a href="http://www.tapsns.com">SNS</a> this week, it just struck me that, rather than trying to assign some debateable value number to options and passing them thru the P&amp;L, let’s do a simpler thing. Let’s just have companies publish quarterly a statement of ownership – who owns what shares; how many new options were granted in the quarter; how many grants expired or were cancelled; new stock issuances as a result of financing moves, etc. And then a clear state of EPS impacts of all this – I just want to know, as a stockholder, did I suffer unfair and unwise dilution during the quarter? This is something that companies could do today without solving the problem of how to value options. And it would be valuable.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/10/29/bcs-rankings.html">BCS Rankings</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>BCS Rankings</strong>. I’ve been noodling over <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/2002-2003.html">these</a>. What a strange way to pick the teams to play for the championship. <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2002/1027/1451838.html">Brad Edwards</a> at ESPN does a good job digging into the mechanics of the system. I’ve been looking at Ohio State’s numbers the last two weeks and have seen some interesting things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most of the top 6 teams lost “strength of schedule” points this week. Only OSU and Georgia improved. OSU gets a double win here and for quality wins as WSU keeps winning. This is really going to come down to nonconference wins for both teams, as the rest of the way they are in conference play and their conference opponents are going to beat the lights out of each other. OSU needs WSU to continue to win.</li>
  <li>While scoring margin has been eliminated as a factor in computer polls, it clearly is still a factor for human voters, as OSU lost two positions in the AP Poll while Notre Dame climbed two positions. This cost us at least a point and maybe more with downstream effects</li>
  <li>Throwing out the worst computer ranking, it is the NY Times, Sagarin, and Colley Matrix polls that are hurting OSU the most, as they have us two positions behind Georgia. TheColley Matrix poll is out of Atlanta, so that explains that. I don’t fully understand the other polls yet.</li>

    <p><strong>Buckeyes.</strong> Nerve wracking win on Saturday but a win is a win.

Tho the vaunted Notre Dame schedule doesn’t seem so tough now as Michigan lost against, Michigan State has collapsed, Air Force lost again, and of course FSU is having an off year.</p>

    <p><strong>School Governance</strong>. Will be attending the PNAIS <a href="http://www.pnais.org/programs/GovConf.html">Governance Conference</a> in early November. Very interested to hear the mood of private school board members as the economy continues to struggle. And when you look at the demographics of this region, the potential market of students is flat or even shrinking a little over the next 10 years. And of course public schools are improving generally. I think we are in for greater levels of competition and greater questioning of the affordability and value of private education, which means we need to focus even more clearly on the quality of our product.</p>

<p>I am close to dumping the gui software I use and just write some scripts. I see that there is Perl support available <a href="http://members.aol.com/Bbirthisel/x10.d/">here</a>. And a web interface on top of perl support at <a href="http://www.homeautomationzone.com/x10-web.shtml">X10 Web Control</a>.</p>

<p>Next year tho I may just pick up a few more dmx dimmers and do away with x10 altogether. I don’t see anything on the web abour perl/python interfaces to dmx tho.</p>

<p>Maybe next year I should be an early adopter of uPNP or some such crazy scheme.</p>

    <p><strong>Blosxom progress</strong>. OK I have now also fixed the scripts to deal with the differences between Win2k/IIS and Unix/Apache handling of path elements after the blosxom.cgi reference in the URL. I can find no way to make Win2k/IIS treat this as a path_info argument to a perl script, so i have changed the script to make “?topic=foo” work as the argument to get a specific content blog – e.g. <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/halloween?topic=props">www.theludwigs.com/halloween?topic=props</a>. Which meant i had to patch up the links that blosxom creates for permalinks, etc. I am pretty sure archive viewing doesn’t work quite right yet tho i am not sure I care since I don’t have an archive for my halloween blog. Also haven’t looked at the RSS output yet.</p>

    <p><strong>Halloween Blog Architecture</strong>. I am toying around with <a href="http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/">blosxom</a> for my halloween blog. i like the innate categorization in blosxom as the defining paradigm since my halloween blog is less about dated posts and more about categories of things. getting blosxom running on win2k is proving to be something of a chore. the base scripts have a lot of assumptions about file system naming and file system functionality that are just broken on iis and nt. I have fixed some of this in my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/blosxom.cgi">trial blog</a> – notably i have changed the blosxom scripts to eliminate their expectation of symbolic links (tho i would like to go back and add in windows shortcut functionality as a replacement). The permalinks are busted tho, as there are some differences in cgi handling in iis vs apache. So still tuning – if anyone has already solved the problem of blosxom on nt, please send me a note!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/10/10/good-trial.html">Good Trial</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Good Trial</strong>. I’ve been trialing the <a href="http://www.good.com/">Good</a> software for the Blackberry 957. The RIM software has always been a little crufty – the todo list for instance is much worse than the Palm’s. So very interested in alternatives.</p>

<p>The pros of the Good software: Full over-the-air sync of all Outlook items (mail, contacts, calendar, todo, notes) is great. I love that. I use notes and todo list a lot, this is a huge boon to me. The homepage calendar view is nice, much more useful than calendar popup reminders. In-band mail addressing is nice – much more intuitive than popping out to the address book browser. Attachment viewing is a nice feature tho not as useful as I thought it would be. It still takes a lot of time to download attachments, and tables don’t come across well as they get unwound to fit on the small screen.</p>

<p>Cons: Performance is slower than the RIM software. I have a large address book (~2000 entries) and a fairly large calendar file. Searching the address book is slower than it was with the RIM software, paging thru the calendar is slower. The RIM software could keep up with my typing, the Good software cannot at times.</p>

<p>Battery life is a big concern. I used up 30% in one day running the Good software – I assume because of the increased radio traffic from all the ota syncing. With the RIM software I could go for a week between cradles without even thinking about it, and 2 weeks at least if I engaged in some modest power management (turn off the device at night). With Good I will have to think a lot more about power management.</p>

<p>The Calendar app is clearly not done. No week view. The month view doesn’t indicate if you have appointments on days, and hence is not useful. No creation of recurring appointments on the device. Agenda view is really really slow. The “jump” dialog is busted – the cursor is placed on the “Go” button by default, not on the date fields. And when you scroll the month field past year end, the year is not auto-incremented.</p>

<p>Addressing doesn’t search on first names. It is great that I can directly edit the “to” field and have it autocomplete names, but i am used to typing in first names and this doesn’t work. You have to type in last names – ugh.</p>

<p>Net/net, based on 3 days experience – I am still sticking with the Good software for now. Over the air sync is nice. But I can’t really enthusiastically recommend it yet. They need to improve performance, the calendar app, addressing, and battery life (I hope they can do over-the-air software upgrades!). Maybe the Good device is better on these fronts.</p>

    <p><strong>Storm Sewer Sounds</strong>. Brilliant – from the MoM Group –</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I always wanted to put sound coming out of my storm drain, so this year I did! I used a 1X2 piece of wood and duct taped my two self powered speakers on it, then I taped the CD player in between the speakers. I put two eye hooks on the ends of the wood and used wire to hang pictures on each eye hook. then I twisted it in the middle to make a loop so I could hook it to a chain to lower it down the drain. I tested it last night and it was awesome! It freaked people out as they walked by! I was talking to a neighbor who was walking her dog and she said she was wondering were the sound was coming from. she said she heard it from the next street! I took a walk down the block and sure enough the sound was coming from all the gutters! HA I found a way to haunt the whole neighborhood! The sound was traveling thru the pipes! If you have storm drains in your neighborhood this is a must try! oooo also forgot I used the whisper MP3 that was posted on the list! man did it sound cool! Imagine walking by the storm drain and hearing that!</em></p>
