				<p><p>Back to Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park (for the second time this week) for Today’s hike. BTW, online maps for the park can be found at the <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/gis/vmc/Recreation.htm">King County GIS Center</a>. Earlier this week we parked at the Anti-Aircraft Peak Trailhead, the Shangri-La trail from that point is a quite pretty tree-lined over-grown roadway, culminating in some huge lightly-treed bowls full of ferns and other ground cover – gorgeous. The trail leads steadily down so you’ll have a bit of a walk back to the trailhead.</p>

<p>This morning started at the Wilderness Creek Trailhead on the SE side of the park. A relative low point, the trail from here is a great cardio workout, steadily up with a lot of switchbacks. I ran out of time and didn’t quite make it to the top of Wildnerness Peak, you should be able to get from trailhead to top in an hour or hour and 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Next up: I think I’ll try the neighboring Squak Mountain trails.</p>

				<p><p>Boy Google has become pretty polluted on the topic of home networking, many of the top pages are thin bags of links, clearly just thrown together to generate google hits and revenue. Here’s my own list of home networking resources that I use.</p>

<p>* Blogs: ** <a href="http://www.practicallynetworked.com/">practically networked</a> – general home network coverage ** <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/">pvrblog</a> – PVRs ** <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/">ehomeupgrade</a> – all kinds of digital home and gagdet goodness</p>

<p>* Software Tools: ** <a href="http://www.purenetworks.com">pure networks</a> – for file sharing, printer sharing, and generally keeping track of what’s on the network (Disclosure: Ignition is an investor) ** <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">itunes</a> – for music playing and sharing. We keep all our music on a server, I wish itunes would push tags and playlists back to the server. ** <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/mobility/getstarted/remoteintro.mspx">Remote Desktop</a> – I use this all the time to manage different machines from the family room – requires XP Pro. I tried a bunch of freeware alternatives but none of them seemed particularly robust at the time. ** <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a> – my backup strategy is to spread copies of photos and music around to 4-5 different places.</p>

<p>* Other websites: ** <a href="http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/category04">Annoyances.org</a> – some handy troubleshooting guides ** <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/">avsforum</a> – for av/hometheater stuff ** <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/">dslreports</a> – nice speed test for your broadband link among other tools ** <a href="http://bbhcentral.com/report/backissues/Report0503_1.html">Sandy and Dave’s</a> – a nice newsletter summing up industry events</p>

<p>That’s the primary list of resources. Anybody else have good ones?</p>

				<p><p>I had my annual physical this week (man I am glad we signed up for <a href="http://www.md2.com/md2.html">MD Squared</a>) and while I am generally healthy, I weigh 3 pounds more than last year. Maybe not a big deal, but I already weigh too much, and if I extrapolate 3 pounds a year – well this is what’s going to kill me.</p>

<p>A big reason for this is that I basically don’t exercise as I find it boring (I guess an early death will be even more boring!). So I need to remedy this. And I need a goal that I care about.</p>

<p>So I’m dusting off a <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000602.html">goal that I set four years ago</a> and have made no progress towards – backpacking significant portions of the pacific crest trail. I need to get in good enough shape to carry a 60-70 pound pack for 5-6 hours a day, for 10-15 days, through up and down terrain, and still have the energy to cook, set up camp, etc.</p>

<p>Step one – get comfortable hiking extended periods of time through tough terrain. I got new boots at rei – some <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/47570069.htm?">zamberlans</a> -- and went on a 2 hour hike this morning to start to break in the boots and get my feet toughened up – <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/parks/rentals/pommar99.htm">Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park</a> is close to home, has 36 miles of trails with a mix of inclines, and has a Nike missile site! Found my first blister-prone spot.</p>

<p>I’m going to keep this up. I’ll spend the rest of this summer getting into a regimen that I can sustain – the most important short term goal is accomodate excercise in a sustainable way into my schedule, if I am not still on a program in 3 months I am in trouble.</p>

				<p><p>Martin has been an enthusiastic blogger about alternative energy <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/going_biodiesel.html">-- his biodiesel commuter car</a>, a <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/iogen_close_to.html">new cellulose ethanol plant</a>, <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/new_biodiesel_p.html">new biodiesel pumps in seattle</a>. I admire his putting his investment and consumer dollars on the line.</p>

<p>It’s made me intrigued about power. I’ve started at <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/recs/recs2001/publicuse2001.html">the DOE site on power use by consumers</a>. I learned that, as of 2001:</p>

<p>* We’re using about 95 Million BTU per household per year. About 4 3/4s short tons of coal for each of our homes if I did the math right. * Most of our use in the home is for heating (our surroundings and our water) and cooling. * The big story from 1993 to 2001 is declining power usage for heating, offset in part by greater cooling usage. I assume our heating systems are getting more efficient though there could be other reasons. * Appliances and lighting are about a quarter of our use.</p>

<p>I am very curious about the next 10 years of use:</p>

<p>* What will hybrid cars do to our consumption in the home? * How will the entry of low power lighting into the home (compact fluorescent, LED) affect usage? * How will the explosion of digital technology in the home affect our level of use – and our demand for uninterruptible power? * How will all this affect our HVAC needs? * What about home power generation? Good article in Wired about <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/1,2167,67465,00.html">home power generation</a>. and look at this <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000507043014/">cool sharp system</a> for managing your home power generation and grid connection</p>

<p>As a bleeding edge user, I am starting to see strains on the power (and HVAC) systems in my home:</p>

<p>* A sea of wallwarts generating DC power and heat in various places in the house. * Significant heat disposal issues in my office and at media centers. I’ve had to do crazy special things to deal with these problems – a special air conditioner for the office, a venting system and fan for the media center. The existing HVAC system, designed for whole house human comfort, is not designed to deal with waste heat from appliances. * Low end battery backups in a couple places in the home to insure continued operation of phones, pcs, etc.</p>

<p>No conclusions here today, just wondering. I’d love to talk to some home builders and understand what they view as state of the art hvac/power systems in the home.</p>
