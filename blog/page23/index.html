				<p><p>In the “counting chickens way before they’ve hatched department”, look at the remaining schedule for the Seahawks, Niners, and Saints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seahawks remaining opponents are 20-32 in aggregate. Niners: 24-34. Saints: 26-31. Advantage: Seahawks.</li>
  <li>Seahawks remaining opponents average a little worse than 3rd place in their divisions. Niners and Saints, about midway between 2nd and 3rd. Advantage: Seahawks.</li>
  <li>Seahawks have 4 remaining away games. Niners 6, Saints 5. Advantage: Seahawks.</li>
  <li>Seahawks away games are easier – the opponents have an average 2-4 record. Niners: 2-4, Saints: 3-3. Advantage or Push: Seahawks</li>
</ul>

<p>The Seahawks are benefitting in particular from the Giants and Vikings cratering this year. Has left them with a great opportunity to secure home field advantage throughout the playoffs, which of course for Seattle is a substantial advantage.</p>

<p>Enjoy your NFL weekend!</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/market.jpg"><img src="images/market-300x195.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brighton/" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lazowska">Ed Lazowska</a> shared some observations about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102433617143638&amp;set=a.983268749488.2650547.10701772&amp;type=1">the failures in some recent large scale public (or quasi-public) software projects</a> – notably <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/us/politics/from-the-start-signs-of-trouble-at-health-portal.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0">the federal health portal</a>. This project, like others, has had a massive budget, and undoubtedly has had hardworking and well-meaning people beavering away on it. And yet is is an operational failure so far.</p>

<p>The discussion on Facebook is worth reading, Ed is a super smart guy and has a set of very smart friends on Facebook. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BenSlivka">Ben Slivka</a> points out that this is not a new pattern, many large scale government IT projects struggle. Ed and others point out it is not just large scale government projects, but large scale commercial projects as well. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rick.rashid">Rick Rashid</a> points out agency problems and also the classic mistake of thinking that a “bespoke” solution is required, that off-the-shelf solutions are just not sufficient – Rick’s comments are very short but well worth reflecting on.</p>

<p>I’ve got some observations up there but I will repeat and expand here. First, there is a dramatic contrast between the economics and quality of this project, and that of internet startup projects. Internet startups survive on a fraction, a small fraction, of the budget allocated to the healthcare portal. And the traffic volumes that the healthcare portal aren’t crazy large, internet startups can scale up to handle these traffic levels reasonably quickly. This suggests that as a society we should try to figure out how to get some of the internet startup mojo applied to the health marketplace portal or other public infrastructure problems. Otherwise all that startup effort is going to be used to serve up animated gifs of cats wearing hats or gosh knows what else.</p>

<p>Second, rather than just trying to learn from internet startups and apply the lessons to a large public software project, perhaps we should create a different structure for these projects that encourages entrepreneurs to work hard on our public projects. Rather than have the government run the whole project, perhaps the government should define the goals and establish prizes, ala the <a href="http://www.xprize.org">XPrize foundation</a>. Rather than committing a priori to a project and plan, let 10 or 100 teams chase the goal, and pick the best at the end of the project. Hand out contracts and award dollars at the end to the best projects and cherry pick the results. Have some consolation awards so that ultimately many teams are motivated to fight their way to the finish line. The government may be better setting goals and handing out awards rather than trying to build it all internally.</p>

<p>There are certainly problems with a prize-driven approach, and some thought needs to be applied to ensure that the most obvious pitfalls are avoided. Having a truly independent panel judge the results will be important. Preventing corruption and influence in the judging process will require some effort. Thinking through the IP issues and ensuring that the resultant IP is appropriately owned would be important. And many others.</p>

<p>We have proven that the way we are engineering these large public systems is costly and not very performant. We should discuss different ways to approach the problem, it seems stupid to keep on doing things the same way.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">10 October 2013</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/cmdprompt.jpg"><img src="images/cmdprompt-300x225.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n3wjack/" /></a>One of the simple reasons why I do most of my dev work on a Macbook is because OSX terminal windows just work way better than Windows command prompts. Notably for copy paste. I can for instance easily copy a command and paste it and re-execute on OSX, or copy it and paste it into an editor window, etc. The normal system-wide copy/paste keyboard commands just work.</p>

<p>Contrast with Windows, where every terminal window has that stupid edit window, and that stupid Mark command, and stupid paste command with no keyboard equivalent (or none that I know). Even the fancy new powershell prompts still have this same old stupid behaviour. it is the behaviour that the dos box had in Windows 95, probably even Windows 3.x before that. In 20 years it can’t be fixed??</p>

<p>Sorry, just in a grumbly mood this morning.</p>

<p>UPDATE: and hey to be clear I am just sshing from either OSX or Windows into Linux VMs. I don’t give a hoot about the native command line tools, except for needing SSH to be present WHICH WINDOWS SCREWS UP AS WELL. C’mon guys, show some pride in your work.</p>

<p>MORE UPDATE: Sadly the Quick Edit setting mentioned in the comments doesn’t really seem to work. Probably why it is off by default. Supposedly it enables Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V Copy/Paste but it doesn’t seem to work on my Win8 machine. Ctrl-C does something – the current selection in the window is forgotten – but doesn’t seem to put the selection into the clipboard. And Ctrl-V just sends a Ctrl-V to the input line, no change. This is true in both the command prompt and the powershell prompt.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.shovelsandrope.com/">Shovels &amp; Rope</a> blew the f$%king doors off the place. They were loud and had great energy. Love their songwriting and their stage presence and interplay. We first became hooked on them based on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nElVTkXmLo">this video</a> which is an utterly intoxicating performance, and captures their presence. But wow they kick up the volume and energy for most of their live show, it was very much a rock and roll show. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dhKoNXp-9M">Tickin Bomb</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBJGTOycVxU">Shank Hill Street</a> were both excellent with the added energy and volume, the guitar work was awesome.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/jsnover">@jsnover</a> nothing irks me more than *nix fanboys slamming CMD. It feels like wilfull ignorance of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PowerShell&amp;src=hash">#PowerShell</a>. I love *nix, but not bash!<p></p>— Reed M. Wiedower (@CTO_Reed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CTO_Reed/statuses/388349973642764289">October 10, 2013</a></blockquote>

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A brief summary of my daily computing environment: I use an android phone currently, iOS iPads, Osx on laptops, win8 on a desktop machine. I develop software components that target most of the above, as well as various flavors of linux for appliances and cloud hosted environments. On a less frequent basis I use a surface RT that I bought at launch. Each os has its pros and cons, each machine has its merits.</p>

<p>I have no emotional attachment to any os because deep down they aren’t all that differentiated. And I can’t afford the luxury of irrational attachment – I need to target users wherever they are, and I need to use tools that are the most efficient. My own usage, and that of most users, is inherently spread across many vendors and many oses, and I don’t see that changing. Multiplatform and interoperability is just a fact of life.</p>

<p>So when I said wanted ssh, I don’t want something better/different than ssh. I want exactly ssh because I need to connect to a variety of environments and ssh is the only reasonable common denominator. Powershell remoting may be super awesome and wonderful, but it doesn’t solve any problem I have, and just introduces a new non-interoperable tool and protocol with its attendant complexity. Not at all helpful – doesn’t save me time, just creates complexity. I am not saying that Powershell remoting is bad, it just isn’t useful in an inherently multiplatform environment. If your environment is Windows only, then by all means embrace Powershell if that works for you.</p>

<p>And when I say I want easy copy/paste, I don’t want copy/paste with some completely different keyboard and mouse interface. Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V and Cmd-C/Cmd-V have become second nature to me, I have a lot of muscle memory built up around those. Giving me copy/paste using some other keyboard interface or mouse interface is not very helpful (nor is command window text selection that works on blocks instead of lines). I don’t need or value innovation in the copy/paste interface, it doesn’t make me more productive.</p>

<p>So for those reasons, for me, OSX is substantially better than Windows as a development tool today. Which frustrates me because these are stupid little reasons, and there is no reason why Windows couldn’t add these features, it would only make Windows more valuable, and would make my life better. And frustrates me because I still have some affinity for Microsoft, and these seem like such petty features over which to alienate developers. If I was in charge, I’d make sure Windows was excellent at modern cross-platform devops, as well as having Windows-centric features. I can’t see the negative in this.</p>

Without a lot of help OSU will be on the outside looking in, even if OSU takes care of business throughout the season. OSU is certainly going to be stuck behind the ACC champ and the Pac12 champ if those teams are undefeated, so OSU needs to remain undefeated and hope those champs have 1 loss.</p>

<ul>
  <li>BC at Clemson, 1230pm, ABC/ESPN2. Unfortunately I don’t think BC is very good so I have to cheer for Clemson to have one of those days where nothing goes right. Probably not happening.</li>
  <li>UW vs Oregon, 1pm, Fox Sports 1. (Why is this game relegated to Fox Sports 1?) Big rivalry game, these schools don’t like each other. Oregon is awash in Nike money and, in the eyes of Washington fans, is the most corrupt school yet to be caught cheating. The Huskies looked very good against Stanford. Oregon has been running up numbers against hapless opponents. Here is hoping that Oregon trips over their first taste of adversity.</li>
  <li>Stanford at Utah, 3PM, Pac12 Network. Utah is a credible team, Stanford might have a letdown after UW game, it is Stanford’s first tough road game. Certainly reasons to hope for the upset</li>
</ul>
</p>
				<!-- <p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bc.png"><img src="images/bc.png" alt="bc" /></a>We are getting close to the first BCS rankings and <a href="http://www.bcsguru.com/bcs_standings.htm">the projections</a> clearly identify OSU’s problem – the computers hate them, and they hate the rest of OSU’s opponents. Without a lot of help OSU will be on the outside looking in, even if OSU takes care of business throughout the season. OSU is certainly going to be stuck behind the ACC champ and the Pac12 champ if those teams are undefeated, so OSU needs to remain undefeated and hope those champs have 1 loss.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cleanrom is the most popular and scrapes off all the AT&amp;T goo while leaving LG goo. This seems like a reasonable approach</li>
  <li>AEON is second most popular but man the pages feel sketchy.</li>
  <li>Basic rom is the third choice and seems to wipe off AT&amp;T and LG cruft.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there is some Korean derivative and a stock AT&amp;T rom that has been rooted.</p>

<p>This is probably all going to turn into a chocolate mess. Don’t be surprised if you call me or text me and never hear back.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Ok I am working first on rooting the phone. This is so obvious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to Settings, General, About Phone, Software Information, and whale away on “Build Number” until developer mode unlocks. Crappiest easter egg ever.</li>
  <li>Back to Settings…General…Developer Options and turn on USB Debugging.</li>
  <li>On your PC, download the LG drivers from <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/support/software-manuals">the LG support web site</a>.</li>
  <li>Hook up the phone to the pc</li>
  <li><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2448887">download the ioroot package</a> pointed to by the xda forums</li>

<p>OK so I guess I am rooted now. Yay. Geek merit badge partially redeemed.</p>

  <li>Battery life is a lot better than the iPhone 5 + ios 7. Not sure why but it is better. Life changing better? No, but I don’t have to run from charger to charger anymore. I can get 3/4s of a day of solid use on a charge, and I am always in the car a little bit each day (with car charger), and so I am generally making it a full day. Much happer.</li>
  <li>As many people have pointed out, the touchscreen is just not as good as the iphone. Fewer pixels, worse software, I don’t know, but it is just not as good.</li>
  <li>Fragmentation has real impacts. I’ve tried to change usage tips with other Android users, and simple things are moved around in the UI from OEM to OEM. Or carrier to carrier. Just stupid on everyone’s part.</li>

<p>I’m going to probably root the phone in the next couple weeks and see if I can’t get a clean Android build on and see if that improves the fragmentation point. Good tips up on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2456">xda dev</a></p>

				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/candide.jpg"><img src="images/candide-199x300.jpg" alt="candide" /></a>The last set of books I read had some stinkers, perhaps not suprising given that I was surfing through popular genre fictions. Decided to raise my standards a little bit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harvesting-Biosphere-What-Taken-Nature/dp/026201856X/">Harvesting the Biosphere</a> by Vaclav Smil. Some <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates">random blogger</a> recommended this book, it’s a descriptive survey of human consumption of the planet’s biological resources. Not very prescriptive, but interesting and great background data. Boy could the author use some data visualization advice tho, a few charts would go a LONG way.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Candide-Optimism-Penguin-Classics-ebook/dp/B00B7NP1HQ/">Candide</a> by Voltaire. What a fun book. My knowledge of mid-1700 European politics and intellectual movements is pretty thin, so thankfully the notes give a lot of context. We need a modern version of this talk written with our idiotic current government and politics as the setting.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sunflower-Possibilities-Limits-Forgiveness-ebook/dp/B000SEH8U8/">The Sunflower</a> by Simon Wiesenthal. This was in the house, I think one of kids had to read this at some point. Probably best read as part of a discussion group or class, the book is not that long or engaging, but the discussions could be very enlightening.</li>
</ul>

				<p><p>I’ve used evernote for years. I’ve loved having my notes everywhere, on every device. They’ve had great coverage of devices. Their UI is a little long in the tooth but still I have loved it.</p>

<p>And now I need to walk away. Twice in the last 2 weeks I’ve experienced unavailability and data loss. On one of my iPads, Evernote refuses to show me any note created past July of this year. No idea why. Uninstall didn’t help. Plenty of storage free on the iPad. Just a mystery.</p>

<p>I might be able to live with this, but even worse one of my notes has just gone missing. Probably the single note I refer to most often as it has some network config info in it for one of my setups. It is just gone. Not in the trash on any device. Just gone. Thankfully I had not sync’ed on my Android phone and was able to copy the missing note before I sync’ed and past it somewhere else. Once I synced it was gone on that device too.</p>

<p>I have no tolerance for data loss. Moving everything out today. Wish there was an note editor that fronted github on all platforms.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I followed through. All my content is out of Evernote and account deleted. I really really really can’t tolerate data loss. All my notes are in github now with an additional replication system in my house so that i am protected against machine failure and github failure. and i have a couple machines syncing with github so i should have version information available in multiple places.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">30 September 2013</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/newleaf.jpg"><img src="images/newleaf-300x203.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/calliope/" /></a>As of midnight tonight, I am a free agent for the first time in a long time. I am leaving Ignition and beginning to plan the next phase of my professional life. It has been a while coming.</p>

<p>I’ve been associated with Ignition for 13+ years – the longest involvement I’ve ever had with a company. The early days were exciting, I was fully engaged. But in 2005, some personal issues caused me to step aside for a while. I eventually was able to recommit time to Ignition, but I never really had the same connection after returning. I found myself frustrated with the venture model, uninspired about the nature of the work, and too often thinking that I was on the wrong side of the table – my empathy was with sweat equity, not financial equity.</p>

<p>And so I’ve made no new investments the last couple years, I’m not part of the latest fund, I’m not currently on a board seat. I’ve effectively voted with my feet, I don’t really want to be involved with the venture business anymore. So effective now, I am completely out of Ignition, I am not involved with management of Ignition or the funds at all. I still have an investor’s interest in the funds, but I am just another LP now. It’s an amicable separation, I wish my remaining friends at Ignition all the best, I will still help them out when asked, as I will my friends at portfolio companies.</p>

<p>Going forward, I am not going to be sitting in the park feeding pigeons. I am as excited about technology as I’ve ever been. I am working hard on retraining myself to be a modern developer, becoming conversant with all the current technologies and tools. I am very excited about the coming wave of ever cheaper devices and the Internet of Things (terrible name tho). It still feels like early days in the digital revolution. I am meeting folks, talking about ideas, prototyping little things, learning open source, brainstorming, etc. I have 25 devices and sensors spread all over my desk. I’m working with some other folks on all this and having a blast. We may form a company. We may do angel investing. We may do something else. At some point I, and we, will be ready to talk about what we are doing next.</p>

<p>For now tho, I am enjoying the freedom of a completely blank slate, and the chance to really dig in to technology. And the opportunity to do more of the things that I enjoy – working with great people, betting on the long technology waves, and figuring out the thin edge of the wedge for new technologies and new products.</p>
