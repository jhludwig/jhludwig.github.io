<p>“Understanding is a poor substitute for convexity (antifragility)” — <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility">Taleb explains the strategy behind cultivating optionality</a> in business and in life, and how that can lead to outsized rewards.  I first encountered his explanation of this in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan">The Black Swan</a> and it has always resonated.  It is why software VC has been so successful – a portfolio of low capital cost trials can lead to great outcomes (and wow the trend is not slowing down – look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P5z7dWHUjQ">unicorn births this year</a>).  It is why well-run software companies can be so successful – again a portfolio of low capital cost bets, with active pruning and management, can lead to great outcomes.  I struggled and was unable to explain this dynamic to my last employer, they could not appreciate the value of creating and encouraging optionality in the business.  </p>

<p>“You don’t have to fix it all now. Just start by starting” — a <a href="https://twitter.com/natehowe/status/1431307397600055296?s=20">great thread</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/natehowe">Nate Howe</a> on digging into problems.  I especially love a couple of his conclusions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“An imperfect solution now is better than a perfect solution that will never happen.” — I have learned this over and over in my life.  I have seen a lot of time wasted trying to find the perfect solution when we could have very well implemented an OK solution and moved on. </li>
  <li>“Doing the thing is often less painful than thinking about doing the thing.” — Yes yes!   I almost always feel better just digging in and working on a problem, rather than letting it sit and fester on a todo list somewhere.  </li>
</ul>

<p>“Code is easy.  People are hard.” — I also enjoyed this <a href="https://review.firstround.com/the-chief-people-officer-as-pm:-rethinking-the-systems-and-tools-that-run-the-company?">article from the Credit Karma Chief People Officer</a> on how she does her job, approaching it as if she is the PM for the tools and systems in the company.  I wouldn’t follow all her practices (for instance, gamifying recognition, ugh), but I love the thoughtfulness and intentionality she brings to the role.</p>

<h2 id="technology"><strong>Technology</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/aug/0819-att.html">GM/ATT announce that select cars will have 5G in 2024</a>.  Only 3-5 years after you had it on your phone!  Car connectivity is completely f&amp;*ked up.  OEMs sign long term contracts that are uneconomic and don’t allow for the explosion of connectivity that people and apps want.  Personal phone data plans runs rings around car connectivity plans and will continue to do so.  OEMs need to open the car up and allow carriers to compete for connectivity, allow people to bring their own data plans, etc.  The current model just kneecaps the automotive software space.</p>

<p>I feel like such a dinosaur when I read about <a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a>.  I may just buy a few NFTs on Opensea.io to learn how it all works.  This <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">article digging into the definition and quantification of “legitimacy”</a> seems interesting.  And here is a <a href="https://dev.to/dabit3/the-new-creator-economy-daos-community-ownership-and-cryptoeconomics-lnl">good high level walk thru some of the current trends</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/towards-the-abolition-of-animal-farming">Tissue-culture meat</a> seems like an important development.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/nifty-corporates">Nice overview at Not Boring about emerging technologies</a>, I love the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-themes-surface-in-the-2021-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies/">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> chart. Ooh, NFTs may be at the “Peak of Inflated Expectations”.</p>

<h2 id="mentoring"><strong>Mentoring</strong></h2>

<p>I recently had a young college student (entering junior year) ask me for some career and schooling advice.  He is a CS major and interested in AI, tho he hasn’t done much in his classwork yet.  He really wants an internship in the space.  I am not sure I had the best advice but i gave him some counsel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get familiar with the AI frameworks getting a ton of investment from Microsoft, AWS, Google.  It is easy to spin up little experiments with these, and they are investing a ton of time in them.</li>
  <li>Get familiar with the data input and data management side of these frameworks.  That is where so many of the problems lie in actual use of AI</li>
  <li>Get comfortable with production software tool chains.  Source control, test frameworks, build systems, test flights, monitoring, etc.  You will need to be familiar with these in your career.</li>
  <li>Go to the websites of your top 5 internship candidates and read the info they have about interns, about past candidates.  Go to your career office at your college and see what interns they have hired and see what background those interns had.  Identify the gaps in your background, and make yourself into a compelling candidate.</li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone has better counsel I would love to hear it.  I’d like to help this young person and others like him find success.</p>

<h2 id="tools"><strong>Tools</strong></h2>

<p>Finally installed <a href="https://textsniper.app/">textsniper</a>.  Should have done this long ago.  </p>

				<p><p>I’m cleaning some older books off the shelf, and peeking at them as I do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. 20+ years old, and a little dated in its examples (CORBA?) and quotes (a Bill Cosby quote?), but still a solid source of guidance on very basic software craftsmanship.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring">Refactoring</a> by Martin Fowler. Hasn’t aged as well. In a world of cloud services, asynch programming, containers, this just doesn’t seem to line up with the fault lines in modern software.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/685486.Patterns_of_Software">Patterns of Software</a> by Richard P. Gabriel. I wanted to like this, and I suspect there is some great stuff in here, but too abstract and meta for me</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete">Code Complete</a> by Steve McConnell. Back before Stack Overflow, Github, online notebooks, great doc sites, this may have been a great guide to software development. Still great topics, but doesn’t seem like the best way to learn.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then some new ones</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56686093-they-called-us-river-rats">They Called Us River Rats</a> by Macon Fry. A look at the settlements along the batture in the New Orleans area. What a way to live.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52379735-the-echo-wife">The Echo Wife</a> by Sarah Gailey. Nicely paced although the purportedly super smart protagonist didn’t seem to think that far ahead sometimes – if you are super good at cloning people and you need to cover up a death, I don’t think it would take you more than a nanosecond to consider cloning the dead person.</li>
</ul>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><h2 id="financial-literacy"><strong>Financial Literacy</strong></h2>

<p>From <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/hood/">Scott Galloway on Robinhood</a>: “…we need to arm ourselves, and particularly our young people, with financial literacy. Everyone should be fluent in the basics of markets and how to build financial security.”</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that we don’t really teach the basics of free markets and personal finance and capitalism.  I was fortunate to have parents and grandparents who shared some wisdom with me, and was fortunate to have stumbled into the right learning opportunities at college and in my early career.  We leave most people ill-equipped to deal with the caveat emptor markets we live in.  </p>

<p>I admire Hadi Partovi and what he has done with <a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> to make computer science education available universally.  I wonder if financial literacy needs a similar push, who the champion could be, what set of organizations would have to be involved. </p>

<h2 id="work-and-purpose"><strong>Work and Purpose</strong></h2>

<p>I met Hadi back during the IE3 days at Microsoft, he was part of the best team any of us had ever worked on.  He recently posted a thread about <a href="https://twitter.com/hadip/status/1426587396343099397">the 25th anniversary of the IE3 project</a> and what it meant to him.  And then he promptly got a raft of sh$t from the twitterverse about work-life balance, death marches, etc.   None of this feedback came from people who were on the ground as near as I can tell.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for everyone but here is my story.  At that time at Microsoft, I felt a great sense of purpose — “A PC on every desk and in every home” was empowering and exciting, it was relevant to the personal systems and nt and apps and consumer teams, everyone was pulling hard on the oar to make the PC a more useful device, and that included a great internet experience.  I was incredibly fortunate to be working during the PC wave, I was thrilled to be working on PC challenges.  </p>

<p>And I was thrilled to be worked with a set of like-minded great people — I learned so much from the chance to work with people at Microsoft in the late 80s and 90s, too many people to list here, but the IE team was chock full of great people and the management chain above me was great.  I worked hard and was happy to work hard.  I never had anyone tell me what hours I had to work, and I never told anyone what hours they had to work.</p>

<p>I am also a nerd.  And Microsoft bought me all the toys I wanted.  I had 3 computers on my desk, i rotated a new one in every 2-3 months, I was able to buy any software I wanted, I had a direct internet tap at my desk, I mean it was kind of nerd heaven.  </p>

<p>I didn’t work as hard as some people — I had two young kids at home, I tried to be home at dinner every night, I refused most travel.  That probably all limited my career but it was the tradeoff that worked for me.  No one ever gave me any negative feedback and all things considered, my career progressed just fine.  </p>

<p>The chance to work on a great mission, with great people, with all the toys I could imagine — I would have worked 48 hours a day if I could have.  I learned more, had more fun, and made lifelong friendships.  I suspect a lot of other people felt the same way.</p>

<h2 id="purpose-and-church-membership"><strong>Purpose and Church Membership</strong></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx">US continues the trend away from participation in organized religion</a>, with less than half of us now belonging to a church/synagoge/temple/mosque.  I am doubtful that human nature has changed dramatically, I suspect people are still seeking for meaning and purpose.  For some reason, church affiliation is no longer meeting that need.</p>

<p>I can’t say why this is happening as a trend, but I can share my story.  I grew up in a Presbyterian household and went to church and Sunday school a lot.  And Reverend Urquhart, our minister, was a thoughtful and compassionate leader — I enjoyed listening to him and I enjoyed the limited opportunities to talk directly with him.  I’ve met other senior leaders at churches since then, and some of them are the most thoughtful and interesting people I’ve ever met.</p>

<p>But … the rest of the church experience was not great.  Sunday school had all the cliques and bad behaviour of regular school, maybe worse, and I was not in the “cool” group.  Church services and rules were rigid.  The church community could be petty — you didn’t dare sit in the wrong pew, you had to wear the right clothes, etc.  The church had all the distasteful power dynamics of any human organization.  The church was insular — my hometown was racially and economically diverse, and I am sure had lots of problems, but you wouldn’t know it from my church community.  By the time I got to college age, I wanted nothing to do with the organized church.  </p>

<p>This is all relatively benign, but served to push me away from the church, and look for purpose elsewhere in life.</p>

<h2 id="random"><strong>Random</strong></h2>

<p>From <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/what-germany-can-teach-america-about-polarization/619582/">The Atlantic</a>, Germany has reduced polarization over decades with a healthy investment in public media.  In the US we have largely handed over all media to private entities, and well, we all know how that has been working out.  Maybe rather than trying to regulate private media or media/tech companies, we should reinvest in the public alternative.  We don’t need to shutter or control the private entities, let them flower and prosper. </p>

<p>Speaking of public media, this <a href="https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/">BBC library of sound effects</a> is pretty awesome, free for non-commercial use.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum/astronomy-photographer-year-2021-shortlist-images">Astronomy Photographer of the Year shortlist</a> – wow.  I aspire to do astrophotography some day.</p>

<p>I didn’t understand all the features of airtags, <a href="https://twitter.com/dguido/status/1424921645483966466?s=20">this thread was interesting</a>.  Now I know why my daughter complained about the airtag beeping in the van she borrowed from us.</p>

An OK telling of the story of the redemption of a man, but I don’t really feel like it added much to the conversation. I would have enjoyed more analysis and criticism of the structures that worked for and against him.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42360879-the-old-success">The Old Success</a> by Martha Grimes. Having not read the previous 24 books featuring this detective, I found it hard to jump into the story. A nice setting and nice writing, but assumes I know too much.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51079278-the-next-great-migration">The Next Great Migration</a> by Sonia Shah. This was interesting and makes the case that migrations and movements of humans/animals/plants is much more pervasive and widespread than we have traditionally thought. But there really wasn’t much about the “next great migration”, I kind of wonder if the author had this title forced on her.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23422.The_Art_of_Travel">The Art of Travel</a> by Alain de Botton. A fascinating discussion of travel, of art, of perception. The book ultimately is not really about travel, but is about perceiving deeply what is all around you. Worth the time.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42360879-the-old-success">The Old Success</a> by Martha Grimes. Having not read the previous 24 books featuring this detective, I found it hard to jump into the story. A nice setting and nice writing, but assumes I know too much.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51079278-the-next-great-migration">The Next Great Migration</a> by Sonia Shah. This was interesting and makes the case that migrations and movements of humans/animals/plants is much more pervasive and widespread than we have traditionally thought. But there really wasn’t much about the “next great migration”, I kind of wonder if the author had this title forced on her.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23422.The_Art_of_Travel">The Art of Travel</a> by Alain de Botton. A fascinating discussion of travel, of art, of perception. The book ultimately is not really about travel, but is about perceiving deeply what is all around you. Worth the time.</li>

				<p><h2 id="setting-goals"><strong>Setting goals</strong></h2>

<p>I used to work with a guy who taught me a simple truth — “If you can’t say what your goal is, you are unlikely to achieve it.”  Simple and obvious and yet so often I forget it and find myself wandering in the weeds.  </p>

<p>I had this hammered home to me in my first real job as a strategy consultant.  We worked with clients who had complex multiyear plans but couldn’t say what their goal was.  Before you even create a strategy, you need to articulate your goal, and it needs to be a believable goal (although with some stretch).  Strategies and plans without clear goals are just exercises in moving papers around.</p>

<p>I had it hammered home to me at Microsoft — the Windows 95 project had clear goals repeated daily by Brad Silverberg and David Cole, and you could rely on everyone pulling the oars in the same way because everyone knew the goal.  The Internet Explorer project had very clear goals, and we were able to get help from all over the company because everyone understood the goal.  A clear simple statement of a goal solves so many issues, you can rely on people to all work towards the goal if they understand what it is and believe in it.  If you don’t have a shared goal across an organization, the organization is going to struggle.</p>

<p>The value of clear goals applies to business, career management, personal life, societal issues.  Noah <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/drawing-pictures-of-cities">talks here about urban development</a> and the value of visualization of the goal.  I love this approach, and I love that Noah doesn’t just visualize the goal, but he breaks it down into its key components and talks about how to make progress against each.  I need to use this in the future on projects.</p>

<h2 id="the-space-industry"><strong>The Space Industry</strong></h2>

<p>In the past several weeks i<a href="https://thewhyaxis.substack.com/p/we-dont-have-to-choose-between-earth">t has been very fashionable to bash the space billionaires</a> – “the pinnacle of waste”, “a private playground for the ultra-wealthy, the commons hollowed out and impoverished to make room”, “symbols of the new gilded age”.</p>

<p>And billionaires putting themselves into space is bad PR, not sure why these guys feel the need.  It’s not like we are going to remember them for this — we will remember the firsts like Gagarin and Armstrong, we will sadly remember the tragedies like Columbia and Challenger.  We won’t remember the first rich dudes.</p>

<p>But consider — the entrepreneurship and intense competitiveness of these leaders and their teams has driven down launch prices, has made the US launch industry the best in the world, and the flywheel is just starting.  And give credit to the US Government for embracing private launches and sending business their way.  A privatized competitive launch industry yields benefits everywhere — lower cost NASA/science missions, lower cost defense missions, better GPS systems, new businesses like Starlink, and I am sure more to come.    </p>

<p>Our problem is not that these companies are climbing all over each other to become best in space.  Our problem is that there are insufficient market conditions in other domains to drive the same kind of flywheel.  In green tech, energy, infrastructure, healthcare, housing — we lack ready access to capital, the revenue streams, reward structures, etc.  And so entrepreneurs don’t enter these markets to the same degree.</p>

<h2 id="managing-personal-devices"><strong>Managing personal devices</strong></h2>

<p>Early in my career I spent an inordinate amount of time installing OSes and device drivers and apps on machines.  Migrating to a new machine was a nightmare, there was so much install state wedged into the machine.  And my personal machines had significant storage and connectivity limitations, and so I had to spent time carefully compressing music and photos, or worrying about what subset of them I carried with me, and where the real authoritative copies were kept.  Man that all sucked.  </p>

<p>High speed networks, high density storage, and the move towards app stores that manage app installs has made life a lot better.  My kids would be aghast at the crap I had to go through as an early personal computer user.  </p>

<p>But there is still a lot of state and config to manage, there is still a lot of room to simplify the world.  I don’t generally need a Windows machine, and am looking forward to trying out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575064/microsoft-windows-365-cloud-pc-launch-date-price-features">Windows 365</a> for those times I do need a Windows machine.   <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp.dev</a> could be cool too, i would love to have a terminal environment that i can use on any machine with a consistent install of tools, repos, etc.   </p>

<h2 id="watson">Watson</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/technology/what-happened-ibm-watson.html">What Ever Happened to IBM’s Watson?</a>  Everyone I knew who had any software experience at all always felt that Watson was overblown vapor.  Somehow IBM got a major pass from the press and from enterprise customers, and still does to a degree, <a href="https://twitter.com/charlesfitz/status/1417607469514301442">Just as they do for their “cloud business”</a>.  My first litmus test for technologies is always – how many thoughtful people have pointed me to some project using that technology?  If the answer is “none” then I am dubious about it.  I have never had anyone point me to a sample project hosted on the IBM cloud or on any Watson technology.  </p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">15 July 2021</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><h2 id="dents-vs-polish"><strong>Dents vs polish</strong></h2>

<p>The industry loves the Steve Jobs’ quote <a href="https://thriveglobal.com/stories/try-to-make-a-dent-in-the-universe/">“We are here to make a little dent in the universe</a>”.   It is kind of a strange quote, a little aggressive.  I wonder if the phrasing isn’t actually a little harmful.  It is a very high bar – and almost none of us will achieve it.  It encourages risk taking, it can encourage really bad behaviour, and it sets us all up for disappointment</p>

<p>Now that I am at a certain age and stage of my career, I have to be honest with myself that I am unlikely to make a dent in the universe.  But I keep beavering away — not to make a dent, but maybe just to polish out some of the rough spots I see, so that maybe life is easier and better for the next person coming this way.  It might be better for all of us to focus on small continuous improvements in the world around us — we are more likely to succeed and be content.</p>

<p>I worked on some great software with some great teams, and we had what seemed like audacious goals, and much of it will be forgotten in a small number of years.  Tho <a href="https://twitter.com/jhludwig/status/1413880979639332870?s=21">this screwdriver we shipped</a> will probably be useful forever, I bet people will be using screwdrivers in the year 2791 long after Windows is forgotten.</p>

<p>Or maybe I am just engaged in rationalizing where my career has gone.  Even so, a focus on just continuous small improvements still seems like a good thing.</p>

<h2 id="xevo-layoffs"><strong>Xevo layoffs</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/connected-car-company-xevo-owned-lear-hit-layoffs-seattle-area/">My last employer did a bunch of layoffs last week</a>.  Very sad and if I can help anyone find their next thing, feel free to give me a shout.  We had built a really great team at Xevo and were chasing some interesting problems.  One hurdle we faced was the unwillingness of auto OEMs to open up their platforms to apps and services.  The OEMs keep a tight grip on the compute and connectivity platforms in their cars, and as a result there is no real market for interesting apps and services.  Someday this will change — some OEM will open up their platform to innovation the way that AT&amp;T finally opened up to the iPhone — but we are not there yet.</p>

<h2 id="talent"><strong>Talent</strong></h2>

<p>I love <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/09/1014366577/biden-moves-to-restrict-non-compete-agreements-saying-theyre-bad-for-workers">this direction from Biden on non-competes</a> – the more we can do to free labor to flow to opportunities, the better off we are.  Non-competes are terrible.  I always felt that, if we couldn’t hang onto our best people, well shame on us for not challenging them or compensating them appropriately.  </p>

<p>Another interesting talent observation — <a href="https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1410686102684459012?s=21">this chart that shows the huge advantage the US has had with innovative immigrants</a>.  Any policy that hampers this immigration is incredibly costly.</p>

<h2 id="software-is-awesome"><strong>Software is awesome</strong></h2>

<p>I love the fact that someone has poured their life into <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrScrutinizer">decoding IR signals</a>, and doing it with passion and structure.  Personal computing and open software tools have been so liberating for people.</p>

<p>Here’s another one — <a href="https://www.chirpstack.io/">a complete stack for dealing with LoRaWAN devices</a>.  With a great website.  Just awesome.  </p>

<h2 id="random"><strong>Random</strong></h2>

<p>I learned during our heatwave that spraying down exterior heat exchangers is actually a reasonable idea.</p>

				<p><h2 id="software-is-eating-the-car"><strong>Software is eating the car</strong></h2>

<p>In the late 80s, PC software complexity was growing dramatically as Moore’s Law delivered more and more compute power to the desktop, and network connectivity began expanding dramatically. Microsoft hired Dave Cutler and a team from DECwest to build the next version of Windows.  Much has been written about this.  Several stars aligned to allow this to happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft management (Billg) realized that a dramatic step up in technology would be necessary to realize Microsoft’s ambitions</li>
  <li>The Microsoft culture at that time was welcoming of great technical talent.</li>
  <li>Microsoft had the equity to attract and reward world class technical talent</li>
</ul>

<p>I am reminded of this as I read <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/advanced-cars/software-eating-car?utm_source=nextdraft&amp;utm_medium=email">How Software is Eating the Car.</a>  150M lines of code, software from hundreds of suppliers, massive amount of growing compute power.  The traditional OEMs with their traditional supplier networks are headed for a wall.  It is going to take a complete restart of the automotive software and hardware stack to compete.  But I am not sure that the stars have aligned for tradiitonal OEMs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do they realize that they need a dramatic investment in software and system architecture?  This will require a complete reboot of systems architecture and tearing apart of their Tier1 relationships.</li>
  <li>Are they welcoming of great technical talent?  Will they allow software teams to come in from the outside and drive radical transformation of system design?</li>
  <li>Do they have the equity to attract world-class technical talent?  Can they offer dramatic equity compensation packages that pull in the architects, principals, senior engineers?  With separate entities like Cruise and Argo they might be able to address this, but I am not sure these separate entities can drive the radical transformation of system design that is needed.  </li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect that the auto OEMs need to make a DECwest-style hire to really shake themselves up — the insertion of a world-class software team right into the middle of their automotive design effort, a team with the chops and mandate to change everything about compute and networking in a car.  </p>

<h2 id="tools"><strong>Tools</strong></h2>

<p>I am not sure why I stuck with vmware so long, <a href="https://www.parallels.com/">parallels</a> is great.  Way more polished than VMWare Fusion, way easier to use.  Sam points out that their GPU virtualization may not be as good yet.</p>

<h2 id="learning"><strong>Learning</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://perell.com/">David Perell</a> mentioned this pearl in one of his newsletters recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…you learn best when you explain something in a new medium.</p>

  <p>So if you read something, you should explain it in a video or a drawing instead of writing about it. When you translate ideas from one medium to another, you can no longer rely on a lot of the handicaps that help you work faster but ultimately inhibit learning.</p>

  <p>This quote from Piaget doubles as a core principle of the company: “The essential thing is that in order for a child to understand something, he must construct it himself, he must re-invent it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="carbon"><strong>Carbon</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-newsletter-24">A bunch of charts on “who are the worst emitters of carbon”.</a>  It is also interesting though to look at “who are the most efficient emitters of carbon” — I.E. which economies generate the greatest amount of GDP per ton of carbon emitted.  This gives you a very different ranking.  If you want to maintain world living standards while emitting less carbon, you might focus on different countries.  The Western industrialized nations may emit a lot of carbon but they also generate a lot of GDP per ton of emission in contrast with, say, Russia or India.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22537052/bismuth-alien-metal-electronics-green-energy-clean">Bismuth is cool.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://scitechdaily.com/statins-used-to-lower-cholesterol-linked-to-doubled-risk-of-developing-dementia/">Statins (may) increase risk of dementia</a>.  Ugh.  I don’t take a statin.  I am pretty conservative on regular use meds – I like aspirin because humans have been using it for a century or more and we pretty much understand the longterm effects of its use.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://highexistence.com/joseph-campbell-quotes/">42 Joseph Campbell Quotes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’re in a freefall into future. We don’t know where we’re going. Things are changing so fast, and always when you’re going through a long tunnel, anxiety comes along. And all you have to do to transform your hell into a paradise is to turn your fall into a voluntary act. It’s a very interesting shift of perspective and that’s all it is… joyful participation in the sorrows and everything changes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Powerful advice.  You can’t control the rate of change and innovation in the world.  You can only decide to accept it and enjoy the ride for your time here.</p>

<h2 id="plenty-of-room-at-the-bottom"><strong>Plenty of Room at the Bottom</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.sadovskyphoto.com/browse">Vlad</a> pointed some of us to this great article on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23358-8">using metamaterials to dramatically reduce the overall size of lenses</a>, very cool.  I am fascinated by metamaterials and our increasing abilities to fabricate things at the nanometer scale — in silicon as well as in bio fields.</p>

<p>One paper I have reread at various points in my education is <a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/1976/1/1960Bottom.pdf">Feynman’s “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom”</a>.  We are still working at relatively crude levels relative to Feynman’s articulation.   We still assemble computers using huge chunks of silicon crudely arranged, moving stupid amounts of electrons around.  But we are making great progress.  </p>

<p>Now I will abuse the metaphor. We have seen so much energy and innovation at the cloud and enterprise level.  There are innumerable IAAS/PAAS/SAAS offerings, the AWS product line all by itself is now huge.  You can sign up at AWS and spin up 10,000 machines to work on vision processing in a few minutes, it is ridiculously easy.  (Tho it is also complex as there are now a kajillion choices for storage, compute, database, stream processing, ML in the cloud).  If you want to apply a massive amount of compute to a problem, it has never been easier.</p>

<p>But at the “bottom” of the compute marketplace, it is a bit of a desert.  At the edge — iot devices, embedded computing, ambient computing — the tools and solutions are not robust, the number of players on the ground is small, it is still very hard to create and deploy software out in the world.  Getting even 5 cameras to work in sync in an edge computing environment is ridiculously hard.  Getting 100 installs of this in different places is very hard.  And we’ve had a fraction the brainpower and innovation applied to the edge that we have had applied to the cloud.  </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sammck">Sam</a> recently reintroduced me to the <a href="https://hubitat.com/">hubitat</a>, they are doing a great work in the edge space.</p>

<h2 id="auto-software"><strong>Auto Software</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/advanced-cars/software-eating-car?utm_source=nextdraft&amp;utm_medium=email">How software is eating the car</a>.  A useful read.  The incumbents are not really prepared for this.  I wonder when we will see the same article for buildings, the home.</p>

<p>I’ve installed the <a href="https://twitter.com/LiftMaster">Liftmaster</a> iPhone app so i can open my garage door from outside the house. Not something I do every day, but super useful at times.  But because I don’t use it every day, I forget the name of it.  No problem, I will search for it on my phone – certainly if I search for Garage or Lift or Door I will find it.  Nope.  OK certainly if I quickly scan all my icons, I will see something that looks like a garage door.  Nope.  Finally Google tells me the app is called MyQ .   Why would you throw away a recognizable brand name for MyQ with an icon that is super generic?  No one will find or remember your app.  If they see it they will assume it is for QFC or Qdoba or Qantas or Quaker Oats.   </p>

				<p><h2 id="building-simple-web-apps"><strong>Building simple web apps</strong></h2>

<p>I have the need to start building some simple websites and web apps.  This is probably the 3rd or 4th time in my career I’ve jumped into building simple sites.  </p>

<p>React is awesome but is a very large pile of technology.  If you just want to hack together a website for a limited purpose, React is daunting.  I want to get back to that world of 1995 when you could hack together a website in notepad.  </p>

<p>Tom MacWright’s <a href="https://macwright.com/2021/03/16/return-of-fancy-tools.html">essay on the return of fancy tools</a> speaks to me – fancy frameworks and tools are great, and really necessary for some tasks, but they add a large amount of complexity to doing a simple task.  </p>

<p>I am drawn to simpler frameworks.  <a href="https://lit.dev/">Lit.dev</a> seems worth learning more about, Vlad has been playing with a little and has had good experience.  <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte.dev</a> has appealed to me and i have written my “hello world” app in it, and now <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs">sveltekit</a> might be the ticket.  Shawn Wang who is way smarter than me about this writes <a href="https://www.swyx.io/svelte-sites-react-apps/">the case for svelte</a> better than I can.</p>

<h2 id="personal-information-tools"><strong>Personal Information Tools</strong></h2>

<p>I saw a nice aphorism recently — “If you write for any other reason than to discover what you think, you are just wasting everybody’s time” – <a href="https://twitter.com/ahaspel">Aaron Haspel</a>.  That is totally why I labor on these posts, I am trying to figure out how to think about certain things in the world.</p>

<p>Blogs are great tools — they have made it easy to capture and post a lot of content — but they are not great for really understanding a topic or a space.  Shawn Wang wrote about <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Maggie Appleton’s summary of Digital Gardens</a> which really resonates.  I struggle weekly with the right way to organize, summarize, and structure my reading and learning.  These posts are an attempt to pull things together, but are themselves another part of the stream and thus part of the problem.  I really want to figure out how to shift to more of a garden view, while maintaining the east of posting.</p>

<h2 id="industry"><strong>Industry</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://benslivka.com/2021/05/27/internet-explorer-a-brief-history/">Ben wrote a nice history of Internet Explorer</a>, which is finally being retired.  Some of the most fun, intense times I had at Microsoft.  <a href="https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/029-telling-the-untold-story">Steven is also writing a nice history of the times</a>.  I will add a couple little anecdotes to Ben’s and Steven’s stories.</p>

<p>One of my jobs at this time was to redeploy teams from existing Windows-centric commitments to Internet commitments.  I was spending time daily working with Ben,  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjones9/">Chris Jones</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-reardon-07182314a/">Thomas Reardon</a>, and others identifying our shortfalls, and finding teams to take them on.  In early ’95 we had a smallish team working on internet client-side technology, within a year we had 700 people and climbing.  A key key lever in this effort was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060812205515/http://www.ianmurdock.com/">Andreessen’s perhaps apochryphal quote that Netscape would reduce Windows to “a poorly debugged set of device drivers.</a>”  This was an incrediby motivating quote inside the Windows team, who were all very competitive people.  They had just killed themselves getting Windows 95 out the door, and yet were volunteering to immediately jump on internet tasks, thanks to this quote.  Made my job much easier.  <strong>Lesson – don’t give your competitors bulletin board fodder.</strong></p>

<p>In early ’96 and we convened a set of web developers to get an early look at our web platform.   A lot of good developers came and we had a lot of great back and forth.  Chris Jones and I led one talk on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX">ActiveX controls</a>, these were going to be great, allowing developers to use great Windows features on webpages.  Wow did we get killed.  We were working at cross purposes to every web developer and they let us know it.  That is when I finally realized that Windows, at its height of power, was fading into irrelevance for a huge class of app developers, and that we had better get cracking if we wanted to remain relevant to these developers.  Not everyone at Microsoft felt this way and it was a source of tension for my remaining time at Microsoft.  <strong>Lesson – build things that are good for your customers, not good for you.</strong></p>

<p>Switching to a more modern topic, <a href="https://twitter.com/bwertz/status/1399016434903126018?s=20">a nice point/counterpoint on the costs of cloud computing</a>.  Is cloud computing expensive at scale?  Sure.  But I fall on the side of – <strong>it is even more expensive to spend your team building a bunch of infrastructure, and losing feature leadership in your market.</strong></p>

<h2 id="sundry"><strong>Sundry</strong></h2>

<p>We have built houses and we have remodelled.  The costs and schedule have always bloated out of control.  And <a href="http://www.thisdayinquotes.com/2011/04/we-have-met-enemy-and-he-is-us.html">“we have met the enemy, and he is us”</a> – invariably we can’t stop ourselves from asking for more features.  Really drawn to prefabs as a way to control the process, <a href="https://www.gessato.com/the-ultimate-modern-prefab-house-list/">and some of these look great.</a></p>

<p>“We have seen a disturbing amount of overconfidence paired with inexperience in the Alaska Range.” — <a href="https://www.nps.gov/dena/blogs/troubling-trends.htm">National Park Service</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/daniel-kahneman-on-noise-the-flaw-in-human-judgement-harder-to-detect-than-cognitive-bias-160525">Daniel Kahneman on ‘noise’ in human judgement</a>.  I may have to read, I am curious how and if he incorporates the understanding of noise from communications theory.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><h2 id="what-to-read"><strong>What to read</strong></h2>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/ckindel/status/1390706287093055488?s=21">Charlie Kindel</a> points out, you can’t trust Amazon reviews anymore (if you ever could).  The entire system has been gamed and broken, in every product category.  I am constantly on the prowl for better ways to find accurate product ratings.</p>

<p>How does one find good books to read?  First and foremost, I rely on friends and family – and am thankful for those that use Goodreads so I get a notice of their recent reading activity.  I also sift thru the book reviews in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/books">NYTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books">LA Times,</a> the <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts">Economist</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/books/">NPR</a>.  I sift thru various lists on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> and <a href="https://fivebooks.com/">FiveBooks</a>.  I look at book lists that smart people publish.  <a href="https://newbooksnetwork.com/">New Books Network</a> was just recommended to me as source of book reviews and recommendations.   </p>

<p>I look for consistently good ratings, and I also look for widely divergent views on a book, as that is often an indicator that the book has something interesting to say. </p>

<p>I am not satisfied tho, I need to do some more thinking on the topic of “how to find great books to read”.  I am a product of what I feed my brain, and being structured and intentional about what material I spend time with is important. </p>

<h2 id="writing-and-creating"><strong>Writing and creating</strong></h2>

<p>Writing is hard, and I would like to get better at it.  I need all the tips I can get, and I need to write more frequently.</p>

<p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/noah-smiths-writing-advice">Noah Smith</a> offers his best tips.  A couple of these really resonate with me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I write because I need to organize my own thoughts.”</p>

  <p>“Reading responses to what you write — both positive and negative — will help you understand the issue better”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also some great guidance on how <a href="https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1386506571828531200?s=20">Apple writes copy</a>.  Pretty good guidance on how to write anything really — you have to really bear down and focus on your message in a fine grained way..  </p>

<p>I want to be creating more — more writing, more software, more craft. It has become so hard to write software — I remember fondly the days of using Notepad to write a web app.  Now you need package managers and bundlers and components and frameworks and templating and all kinds of crap to write web apps.   And writing cloud apps has become crazy confusing with Amazon, Azure, Google spitting out new services weekly, in addition to all the lesser vendors.  </p>

<p>Suppose you want to develop some AI software, look at this amazing <a href="https://landscape.lfai.foundation/">AI landscape chart</a>.  What is an aspiring developer supposed to do?  This is daunting.  It is a career to just understand all these pieces.</p>

<p>For web apps, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> is interesting, a framework to get back to simple authoring of websites.  Recommended by <a href="https://tongfamily.com/">Rich</a>.  Embraces markdown which seems nice.   </p>

<h2 id="strategy"><strong>Strategy</strong></h2>

<p>Some <a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/seven-powers/">good thoughts here from the ceo of Twilio on building businesses and strategy</a>.  I like his views on strategy – </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…strategy is a dirty word because it is this idea that the people at the top of the company have developed a strategy and everyone in the company is supposed to blindly follow this strategy, whether or not your customers want you to follow that strategy.”</p>

  <p>“There is only one true strategy, build products and services for which your customers will pay you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strategy is too often viewed as a top-down thing.  The best strategies are deeply bottoms-up, rooted in what customers are doing and what you can actually build.</p>

<h2 id="security"><strong>Security</strong></h2>

<p>I am cranking up security yet again on financial accounts.  About every 6 months I relook at my practices, talk to smart people, and amp up our protection.  We have been victims of SSN theft tho thankfully it has never become more than a supreme annoyance.</p>

<p>I have moved away from easily guessable account IDs, phone numbers, and email addresses.  I’ve seen attacks on our accounts based on guessing some of these (or harvesting phone numbers and email addresses from the web).  This is unlikely to happen on our accounts now.  I’ve also added in hardware security keys.  Some of our financial institutions don’t support keys yet, and we may have to look at shifting away from some of them in the next wave of changes.  </p>

<p>I’m also starting to invest in processes for transitioning account ownership as I age.  This is uncomfortable to think about, and all this security makes it harder.</p>

<p>I welcome any other great ideas!</p>

<h2 id="history"><strong>History</strong></h2>

<p>A <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57186266">final goodbye to Internet Explorer</a>.  Gosh did some great people work on the early versions of IE.  Sending great thoughts out to everyone.</p>
