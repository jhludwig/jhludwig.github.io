    <p>As one of the Amazon reviewers says, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553580515/qid=1061766790/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-5693187-3796024?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: &lt;i&gt;Passage&lt;/i&gt;">Passage</a> is a “fascinating topic, so-so novel” which “seems bloated and frequently dull”. I liked the <em>Doomsday Book</em> by this author (who didn’t), but <em>Passage</em> was trying.</p>

I’d like to install Newsgator on both so that the full admin interface was available at either place.

Alternatively I’d like a web interface to all the admin operations so that I don’t need to install on two machines.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/08/18/who-reads-what.html">Who reads what</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Ha, from my friend Tim. Probably a classic but I hadn’t seen in memory:</p>

<p>Who Reads What and Why</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Wall Street Journal is read by the people who run the country.</li>
  <li>The New York Times is read by people who think they run the country.</li>
  <li>The Washington Post is read by people who think they should run the country.</li>
  <li>USA Today is read by people who think they ought to run the country but don’t really understand the Washington Post. They do, however, like their smog statistics shown in pie charts.</li>
  <li>The Los Angeles Times is read by people who wouldn’t mind running the country, if they could spare the time, and if they didn’t have to leave L.A.to do it.</li>
  <li>The Boston Globe is read by people whose parents used to run the country and they did a far superior job of it, thank you very much.</li>
  <li>The New York Daily News is read by people who aren’t too sure who’s running the country, and don’t really care as long as they can get a seat on the train.</li>
  <li>The New York Post is read by people who don’t care who’s running the country either, as long as they do something really scandalous, preferably while intoxicated.</li>
  <li>The San Francisco Chronicle is read by people who aren’t sure there is a country, or that anyone is running it; but whoever it is,they oppose all that they stand for. There are occasional exceptions if the leaders are disabled minority feminist atheist dwarfs, who also happen to be illegal aliens from ANY country or galaxy as long as they are democrats.</li>
  <li>The Miami Herald is read by people who are running another country, but need the baseball scores.</li>
  <li>The National Enquirer is read by people trapped in line at the grocery store.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d guess Seattle is some amalgam of LA and SF, with maybe a little New York Post.</p>

    <p>Prelim report released – <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/releases/miscellaneous/2003081401ms.htm" title="NCAA RELEASES INTERIM REPORT ON THE EFFECTS OF SPENDING IN INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS">NCAA RELEASES INTERIM REPORT ON THE EFFECTS OF SPENDING IN INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS</a>. The most interesting points I saw, not mentioned in the press release, have to do with the increasing inequality of spending:</p>

<p>_</p>

<ul>
  <li>A common measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient, which would equal one if one school accounted for all spending and zero if spending were the same across schools. Increases in the Gini coefficient represent increased levels of inequality and vice versa.</li>
  <li>Between 1993 and 2001, the Gini coefficient for Division I-A football spending rose from 0.26 to 0.29. To put that increase in perspective, it is approximately equal to the increase in income inequality in the United States during the 1980s. The Gini coefficient for Division I-A basketball spending rose even more sharply, from 0.26 to 0.31.</li>
  <li>Inequality also increased among top-spending schools. The Gini coefficient for football spending among schools in the top 25 percent of the spending distribution, for example, rose from 0.08 in 1993 to 0.11 in 2001.</li>
  <li>We conclude that the football and basketball markets exhibited increased levels of inequality between 1993 and 2001.</li>
</ul>

  <h1><a href="/2003/08/14/basic-lighting-tip.html">Basic Lighting Tip</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>From <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MethodzOfMadness/" title="Yahoo! Groups : MethodzOfMadness">Yahoo! Groups : MethodzOfMadness</a>, the basic lighting tip for the day: <em>Instead of lighting an area with a solid color, try lighting it with more than one color from different angles to give the same effect. He used the color blue as an example. Lighting an area in blue to simulate moonlight tends to wash out everything. I know this, since I’ve done it in my haunted yard every Halloween. It makes it very hard to read epitaphs and just seems to make everything blurry. Instead, the article suggested using 2 different light sources, each with a color on either side of the color wheel from blue: cyan and magenta. The combination of the 2 gives the same blue effect, but with interesting shadows, where one color shines but the other doesn’t. I’m going to try it this year, assuming I can find some outdoor lights in cyan and magenta!</em><br />
And: <em>Generally you would use a white light with a color gel. Gel is available in a couple hundred colors and can be purchased at your local Theatrical Supply Company. If you must use a colored bulb, Satco (A light bulb manufacture) has about a dozen different colored flood lights. Most hardware stores or Electrical supply places should be able to order then for you in case quantities (usually 6)</em></p>
