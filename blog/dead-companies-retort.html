	<title>Recent Books -- Dead Companies Walking, Allow Me to Retort, Piranesi – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="
  Dead Companies Walking: How A Hedge Fund Manager Finds Opportunity in Unexpected Places by Scott Fearon and Jesse Powell.  Some parts of this were great.  The central idea that company failure is a lot more common than success, and that you should have an investment strategy which embraces that, is a good idea, though I don’t have the appetite for risk required (tho maybe I should invest in a short fund).  His portrayal of short sellers as the true heroes of our economy is a bit of a stretch.
  Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy’s Guide to the Constitution by Elie Mystal.  Fantastic.  Parts of this may antagonize you, and he may go further on some points than I accept, but a well argued and passionate examination.  You have to appreciate his voice and vigor.
  The Last Watch by J.S. Dewes.  Meh. Billed as the Expanse meets Game of Thrones, it is neither.  A vague attempt to set the Game of Thrones Wall in space but uncompelling characters and uncompelling story.
  Hush Hush by Mel Sherrat.  Formulaic, one dimensional characters.  Not worth finishing.
  Piranesi by Susanna Clarke.  Now this is more like it.  Evocative, strange, fantastic.  Incredibly strange and highly relatable.
