<p>So to say anything outrageous, I just need to find someone else who has said it and point to them – <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,59424,00.html" title="Wired News: Bloggers Gain Libel Protection">Wired News: Bloggers Gain Libel Protection</a> – which means I can just do some anonymous post somewhere on some service and then point to it. I guess libel is effectively dead then for individuals…</p>
