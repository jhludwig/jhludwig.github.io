<p>After reading an interminable number of posts about FOAF at <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/">Marc’s blog</a>, at <a href="http://weblog.garyturner.net/2003_07_01_archive.html#105916401783525110">Gary Turner’s blog</a>, at <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/21/technorati_talks_foaf.html" title="Joi Ito's Web: Technorati talks FOAF">Joi Ito’s Web: Technorati talks FOAF</a>, I finally added my FOAF file and informed Technorati of it, using Joi’s helpful steps. Apparently I run in a dull crowd because none of my friends have foaf files, so I am not sure what the point is, but i was feeling shamed into creating it.</p>
