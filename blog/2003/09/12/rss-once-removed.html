<p>A feature request for my aggregator – <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/" title="NewsGator - the RSS news aggregator for Outlook">NewsGator - the RSS news aggregator for Outlook</a> – I’d like to be easily able to see the RSS feeds of the sites to which I am subscribed. E.G. I have a subscription to the feed from <a href="http://mediasavvy.com/">MediaSavvy</a>, I’d like to also see the feeds from the blogroll on MediaSavvy. I want my aggregator to auto-discover the list of feeds and go gather their most recent headlines on my demand.</p>

<p>Back in the day when I used to actually visit blogs, it was easy to discover new websites by occasionally walking thru their blogrolls. With aggregators, I lose that behaviour as I rarely go to visit the sites, and so my reading list gets stale and static.</p>
