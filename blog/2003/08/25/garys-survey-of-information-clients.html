<p>Gary is doing a little survey of information clients – <a href="http://gary.burd.info/space/entry-72.html" title="Gary Burd: Information clients">Gary Burd: Information clients</a>. Very interesting space – I’ve mentioned in the past that <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000035.html">my blog is becoming in some ways my pim</a>, i would love to be able to do more pim-like things in my blog, and be able to pull in and export more sets of data. I really want a server side solution, and some of these codebases might work. I certainly need a much better security model tho if I am to start putting more personal data up on the blog.</p>
