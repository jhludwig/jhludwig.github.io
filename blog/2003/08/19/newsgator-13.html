<p>I of course installed – <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=632" title="Greg Reinacker's Weblog - NewsGator 1.3 released!">Greg Reinacker’s Weblog - NewsGator 1.3 released!</a> – this is my favorite way to read RSS. One thing I haven’t tried is running newsgator simultaneously on multiple machines. I use outlook at home and work and both machines stay on all the time. I’d like to install Newsgator on both so that the full admin interface was available at either place. But I am afraid to do so as I think the machines will likely battle to download feeds and I will see some ugly races and duplications. Alternatively I’d like a web interface to all the admin operations so that I don’t need to install on two machines.</p>
