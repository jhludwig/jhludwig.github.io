				<p><p>Look at my choices for TV watching:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=615">Akimbo service now available for MCE boxes</a>, and Akimbo itself aggregates a lot of content. * <a href="http://pealco.net/archives/2004/11/08/how_to_never_miss_an_episode_with_bittorrent_and_rss">How to stick rss and bittorrent together.</a> Great tutorial to how to bind these together to find the content you want * <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=595">An example use of bittorrent to find very targetted content of interest</a> * Then I have the DVR/service choice – <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2004/11/pvr_comparisons.html">a comparison chart of many of the options</a>; a claim that people are <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=611">moving from tivo to comcast/msft</a>. God forbid you have multiple pvr/service variants in your house (as I do), figuring out where Fox Sports Northwest is on any given box is hard. * Then of course there is game content. Xbox and xbox live; pc games on win mce with all their live components; and for extra fun phil has pointed me towards the <a href="http://xport.xbox-scene.com/">mameox emulator for the xbox</a>. * And finally DVDs and ripped DVDs.</p>

<p>How do I find what I want to watch or do at any given time? I am tired to hell of learning all the different program guides, search interfaces, etc. And it seems like the complexity is only going to grow for people as video downloads over IP (ala bittorrent) become easier and easier to do.</p>

<p>No answers here, just whining.</p>

				<p><p>Despite <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001722.html">my glow from the weekend’s results</a>, I still have <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001717.html">deep misgivings about the morality of college football.</a> And I’ve gotten some nice email feedback from people – the hypocrisy in the game is so apparent – adults making nice livings off the back of young men’s efforts, young men who have few alternatives, no voice, and ultimately no power.</p>

<p>I don’t expect the system to change. Certainly not dramatically. But it’d be nice to see some gentle progress:</p>

<p>* I’d start with getting a baseline of data. The NCAA should do a random survey of players 5/10/15/20 years out of school and find out what help these players need or could have used. If we are going to direct more funds to these players we should have an idea about what they need. Absent this data tho… * I’d set up a pension plan for the players so that they and their kids can get a little something later in life. Might be as little today as a tuition plan for their kids. * I’d give a player lifetime tuition credit. The player can come back to the U at any time and take classes towards a bachelor’s degree. The cost is minimal and it could be a huge benefit. * The players need some representation in the decision process about the spending of the proceeds. Not sure how to do this but I don’t think it is right that the players have no voice at all today in how proceeds are spent. The fact that OSU can fund a huge number of varsity sports is nice and maybe that is the right thing, but maybe not – maybe the football players would vote not to fund the fencing, pistol, and riflery teams (real teams). * Certainly they should be allowed to leave school early like NBA players and play pro ball. It is ridiculous to force a young adult to go through the hoops of college if they have no interest or aptitude for college.</p>

<p>And a good point raised by a friend, the NFL should help fund these programs as well. The NFL has been getting a free farm system for years, there is no reason for this.</p>

				<p><p>OK the comcast dude dropped by and installed today. (A moment of hilarity as he insisted checking to see if my cable was properly grounded or not – a 10 minute tour of my wiring closet with both DirecTV and Comcast feeds in, and many feeds out, convinced him that he didn’t really want to dig into the grounding issue.)</p>

<p>First reactions – the UI is slightly cleaner than the older Comcast box I had. It is nice that they have hoisted HDTV content upto the main menu, it is way easier finding that content now. That is probably the biggest plus I’ve noticed so far. I can’t comment yet on season pass and other record functionality as I am waiting for the program guide to populate – why does it take so much longer than DirecTV.</p>

<p>The UI style is not very exciting – my 3 year old Tivo box still has a more compelling UI. Is this Comcast’s or Microsoft’s hand?</p>

<p>Setting the TV/Audio out settings requires you to enter a weird bios-like mode, totally outside of the normal ui and control environment, that is weird, and I had to do this as the box didn’t seem to default to reasonable HDTV settings.</p>

<p>Of course the huge feature is going to be recording of HD content.</p>

				<p><p>OK it has taken me a week to wrap my head around the latest goings-on at OSU re the football program – <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1919246">Maurice’s claims</a>, <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/football/football.php?story=dispatch/2004/11/14/20041114-A1-02.html">the car program (sub req’d)</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1922656">OSU’s invititation to the NCAA</a>, <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/story/7894911">Geiger and Tressel responses</a>, people <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/big10/archives/001976.php">calling for life bans and death penalties</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Man do I love college football, and OSU football in particular. It is in my blood. Been going to games at Ohio Stadium since I was a toddler. Father played and lettered for the Buckeyes. I have Woody’s autograph. Watched the ‘68 team win it all. Suffered thru the end of Woody’s career, the Bruce and Cooper years. Was at the Fiesta Bowl when the team won it all again two years ago. There is just nothing rational about my affection for the sport and for the Buckeyes.</p>

<p>But…Hmm…I have to say I have deep deep deep misgivings about the morality of college football. OSU brings in roughly $90M a year in athletic department revenue, and that is mostly from the football program. To keep things simple, let’s say that is $1M per scholarship football player per year (don’t whack on me about other sports, this is just a convenient ballpark figure).</p>

<p>That is just the on-the-books benefits to the university. You have the car program – 85 cars to everybody and their dog associated with the program. I am sure there are other benefits like this that come in to the staff. You have sponsorship and TV revenue for the top coaches. Is any of this controlled or limited by the NCAA?</p>

<p>And then the Big Ten and the NCAA make revenue off the top of TV packages and bowl/tournament proceeds.</p>

<p>Where does all this largess go? Great facilities. Support for other sports programs. Great salaries and comp packages for coaches, administrators, NCAA staff, Big10 staff. What flows to the players who we are all going to see? About a $15K annual benefit in the form of scholarship and room and board.</p>

<p>Do the players, who are the reason the money is coming in, have any representation in the allocation of the funds? No. Can they opt out of the system? Not really, the NFL won’t let them in. If you want to play football as an 18 or 19 year old with a chance to go to the NFL, you have to go to a college, whether you are interested in a college education or equipped to handle one.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, while you are at college, you have a full time job called “playing football”. It consumes a ton of time. You have to fit in your academic responsibilities on the side, and good luck finding time for a job to earn some spending money.</p>

<p>So this is the system that responsible adults have created and are running for these young men. Huge benefits flowing to the administrators of the system and to other bystanders, no representation for the players. Does this seem moral at all?</p>

<p>And then we attack the players and destroy their careers if they somehow get some small extra benefit or extra help fighting their way thru college. With the huge inequity between value creation and value distribution, do we really believe that the system is not going to be leaky?</p>

<p>Honestly the rational thing for me to do is to quit supporting the sport, quit watching it. The system is taking terribly unfair advantage of young adults. I am not sure I can quit tho, the emotional connection is so huge.</p>

<p>Perhaps I need to start investigating reform measures and how to get involved in grass roots advocacy programs for the players. They deserve a lot more out of the system than they are getting today.</p>
