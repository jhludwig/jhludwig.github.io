				<p><p>So, with <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/003946.html?wbfrom=rss">Yahoo’s inevitable announcement of Yahoo desktop search</a> – just how many freakin’ indexers are we all going to have to run on our machines? I am going to need a multicore proc and dedicate one of the cores to running the google indexer, the yahoo indexer, the lookout/msn indexer, the winxp indexing service. and then of course all the media player and photo indexers that come built into all these apps.</p>

<p>Longhorn was purportedly going to solve this but now <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9135">winfs may not even be in the release after longhorn</a>, at least that is how I read this article.</p>

<p>So the market for fs value-add utilities will be strong for the rest of the decade – not just indexers, but replicators and synchers like <a href="http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Linux.html">unison</a>, <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001746.html">software raid and other lower level solutions</a>, etc. We all have way too much free disk space at our disposal, software will spring up to use it for reliability, performance, ease of use.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">10 December 2004</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>For some reason, about two weeks ago, my IIS server (that this site resides on) quit being able to resolve DNS names. I’ve tried changing my DNS servers, no avail. I’ve tried turning off and turning on the DNS Client Resolver, no avail. The only config change I have made recently is to turn on the WebDAV extension in IIS, I turned that off, no avail.</p>

<p>This happened to me when I first installed XP Server 2003 and it was due to a 3rd-party socket filter that i had to remove. Going to investigate that next. Also going to look at ways to log the traffic at the IP level as i try to hit a named site to see what is happening.</p>

<p>Static pages on the site work fine obviously, but any kind of dynamic page tends to fall over.</p>

<p>Maybe it is time to move to a hosted solution. Not really having fun chasing this crap down.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: used the Network Monitor utility in XP to see that, for whatever reason, the DNS servers I had been using were returning “name not found” to all my requests. Further dug in and found that our ISP had provided us new DNS servers to use for our DMZ boxes a couple weeks ago. All fixed up now. Don’t really understand why the old DNS servers were still operational and still responding to DNS requests at all, but onward and upward.</p>

<p>At the same time, enterprise storage functionality is transitioning down to consumers – <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/storage/lacie-external-sata-drives-027389.php">external sata connectors</a> allowing really high speed detached storage, <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/linux/archives/20041210_instant_nas.phtml">lightweight nas solutions</a>, a bunch of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=software+raid">software raid solutions</a> – but it is all way too hard to use for most people.</p>

<p>Seems to me like there is a path out of commodity pricing for the hard drive guys. The first player to bring enterprise storage functionality – replication, auto-backup, hot swapping, pooling, etc – to consumers and small businesses in a brainlessly easy to use package could be a big winner.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.supremerestaurant.com/">Supreme</a> in Madrona. Loved it! Great neighborhood place, super service, great food, a calm and relaxing place. * <a href="http://www.serafinaseattle.com/">Serafina</a>. The food was good, we’d go back, but it was very crowded and a little frantic. Good if you are in the mood for that. * <a href="http://www.firenzerestaurant.com/">Firenze</a>. One of our consistent favorites. Not in a very promising space, but great food e.very time. * <a href="http://www.gourmetfoodplaza.com/Series/Restaurants/QueenCityGrill.htm">Queen City Grill</a>. Another consistently good place. Not as trendy as some of the places in Belltown, but always good. * <a href="http://www.flyingfishseattle.com/">Flying Fish</a>. Did the chef just change? We were very disappointed there recently. Every dish was bland and poorly cooked. It will take some dramatic change for us to ever go back.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://www.openwave.com/us/news_room/press_releases/2003/20030915_opwv_reardon_0915.htm">Reardon</a> reminded me recently that I read a lot of books. I looked over <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/cat_books.html">the list</a> this year and was a little suprised myself. And what a lot of dreck in there, I wonder why I plow thru some of this.</p>

<p>But to save others from plowing thru the dreck, here is my short list of good reads this year. Some new, some quite old.</p>

<p><strong>Fiction</strong>:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312278497/qid=1081897958/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Glass Bead Game</a> by Hesse. 3/4s of a year later and I can still recollect vast swathes of the book as well as particular scenes. Well worth the time. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/103-6281811-4989432?index=blended&amp;keyword=The+Curious+Incident+of+the+Dog+in+the+Night-time">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</a>. Totally expected to hate it, thought it was just trendy, but this was a solid and memorable story. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802130208/qid=1082873989/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">A Confederacy of Dunces</a> by Toole. Great great characters, dying to be a movie. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/4770019572/qid=1084987282/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Musashi</a> from which I picked up <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001475.html">my favorite quote of the year.</a></p>

<p><strong>Non-fiction:</strong></p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm">The 9/11 Commission Report</a>. Again, every US citizen should read this. * And while you are at it, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Imperial Hubris</a>. At the very least, thought-provoking and internally consistent. * And lest these two depress you too much, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400041767/qid=1091718131/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig</a> for a view on a country and culture that is really screwed up.</p>

				<p><p>I picked this up based on <a href="http://www.tongfamily.blog">Rich</a>’s reco. So the first 90% of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-2817119-8833737?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Imperial Hubris</a> just pissed me off, I thought the author was just being an apologist for Osama, explaining again and again the rationale for his actions and the support he enjoys.</p>

<p>But the close of the books was great. Two messages. One, we are at war, let’s quit pussyfooting around, let’s apply the full weight of our force on a focused effort to win. Two, let’s at least have a discussion about the policies that have forced us into war – our energy policies, our support for autocratic regimes, our unflagging support for Israel. Maybe these are the right policies, maybe not, but let’s at least have a discussion and agree that they are worth a war.</p>

<p>I feel a little shamed that I am not sacrificing much personally in this war. Here’s <a href="http://www.windsofchange.net/archives/003234.php">a pointer again to a great post about how we can support the troops.</a></p>

<p>* <strong>Best</strong>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.cyberguys.com">Cyberguys</a>, <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a>, <a href="http://www.redenvelope.com">Red Envelope</a>, <a href="http://www.duluthtrading.com">Duluth Trading</a>. None of these sites are price leaders but they accurately report what they have in stock and what you can really get. I hate sites that promise stock they don’t have. They all report status well on orders and let you know tracking numbers, etc. Red Envelope does a really nice job of reporting when a gift has been delivered to a recipient. Amazon has had some site flakiness the last couple of weeks but still has been good. Oh yes, <a href="http://www.shutterfly.com">Shutterfly</a> should be in this list too, they have consistently gotten us our pictures in timely fashion – I can’t imagined wasting time printing pics myself. * <strong>Good</strong>. <a href="http://www.newegg.com">Newegg</a>, <a href="http://www.Organize-Everything.com">Organize-Everything</a>, <a href="http://www.Mountainmiser.com">Mountainmiser</a>. Sites a little harder to navigate than the best, and online stock reporting not as accurate, but good communication and we were able to work things out. * <strong>So-so</strong>. <a href="http://www.Abesofmaine.com">Abesofmaine</a> is a price leader, but their online inventory info is a sham – they claim to have everything but in fact…so they did call me and we were able to work out an order, and it showed up, but I don’t feel great about the experience. * <strong>Danger Danger</strong>. <a href="http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQgotopageZ1QQsassZcomputerstuffreeQQsorecordsperpageZ50QQsosortorderZ1QQsosortpropertyZ1">Computerstufffree on ebay</a> – will I ever see my product? Purchased weeks ago and no communication about shipping status, transaction status. I’m nervous… * <strong>Incomplete</strong>. <a href="http://www.coloradokayak.com">Colorado Kayak</a>, <a href="http://www.watchclick.com">watchclick</a>. Transactions pending…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">Rich</a> and I are having a running discussion about the iPod and Apple’s ability to continue to dominate this business. Certainly the development of a community of developers and partners as the above links illustrate is a powerful asset for Apple. As a 4 iPod household, I’ve certainly voted with my feet. But…it is not a very sticky experience, I could move all my media to a competitive player tomorrow and lose very little. A network of related apps and solutions might start to create stickiness.</p>
