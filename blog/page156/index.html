    <p><strong>Halloween Preps</strong>. After much deliberation I’ve settled on my projects for this year. I am a) going to beef up my lightning primarily by switching to blue photo floodlights as discussed on <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html">my halloween blog</a>. B) I am going to try my hand at a small axworthy ghost project, drawing inspiration from some of the more <a href="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/urmyslav/page1.html?mtbrand=AOL_US"></a>extreme setups out there. I’ve tracked down a motor and am going to start laying out all the gear i need this weekend. c) i am going to build a small <a href="http://members.accesstoledo.com/kkrazykkaren/Floating/Lantern.html">flying lantern</a> setup. i’ve also gotten my cheap mirror ball motor for this and am going to start getting the rest of the gear this weekend.</p>

<p>There are some minor other things I want to do but these are the longer leadtime items. I’ll try to post pictures as I make progress.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/05/13/realnames.html">Realnames</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>RealNames</strong>. Lots of press about <a href="http://www.realnames.com/body/home.asp">Realnames</a> going out of business – for instance at <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/05/12">Scripting News</a>. Most of it very anti-Microsoft. I think <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/23/25245.html">The Register</a> has it right tho. Actually maybe the tide is turning – <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a> has it right too.</p>

<p>Realnames is dying because a) it has very little utility for most end users. Search engines and autocomplete in the browser make it pretty easy to find things. b) it has little utility and lots of cost for site developers. It doesn’t make it that much easier to find my site (see a) and it costs me money. c) it has little utility for advertisers. They already have to put URLs and AOL keywords in their ads. Neither of these are going away. Why put in a 3rd that has less coverage than either of the prior two?</p>

<p>It is easy to point a finger at Microsoft and say they are to blame. But Microsoft did a deal with Realnames at a time when other large players did not – where was AOL? A merger of AOL keywords and Realnames might have made sense, by providing a common name across the internet and the AOL service.</p>

<p>Had the service been incredibly compelling I am sure lots of deals would have occured. But the bottom line is the service didn’t solve that many problems. I just did a quick check on google. Searching for “Ignition” – first several hits were relevant. Searching for “Ignition Venture” or “Ignition Seattle” – first hit was dead on our home page. When we set up our homepage I considered getting a Realname – but given the experience above, I couldn’t ever justify the cost. I think most people did the same math.</p>

    <p><strong>Your Tax Dollars at Work</strong>. The Ohio State Legislature, after 200 years of statehood, is finally rectifying an <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=124_SB_264">obvious oversight</a> – choosing a state amphibian. Thank goodness. It can join now the state beverage – tomato juice – and the state fossil – trilobite – and the many other fine symbols of Ohio.</p>

<p>Here in Washington we are <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/legis/symbols/symbols.htm">waaaay behind</a> – we have a state insect, fish, fossil, tree, but no amphibian. Are slugs amphibians? They’d get my vote.</p>

In the interview, Mr. Kellner said some very interesting things, including characterizing those who skip television commercials as thieves: [Ad skips are] theft. Your contract with the network when you get the show is you’re going to watch the spots. Otherwise you couldn’t get the show on an ad-supported basis. Any time you skip a commercial or watch the button you’re actually stealing the programming.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Blogger alternatives</strong>. I love blogger. I love the fact that so many people are doing useful things with it.</p>

<p>But it is clearly a tech-weenie experience. Stability is poor. There is often disagreement between blogger and me about what has been really published. I often have to whack blogger upside the head to get it to correctly publish my content. I have recommended blogger to many people but my non-tech-weenie friends find it daunting.</p>

<p>So I am on a mission to find alternatives. Looked at Movable Type – but don’t really want to install server software, I am very wary of installing even scripts on my server that come from sources I don’t know. I played with Radio some more. It shares some of the stability and tech-weenie nature of blogger.</p>

<p>Next up is citydesk from <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek Software</a>. OK I have citydesk from fogcreek installed. The article management UI is nice. Including pictures is easier than blogger. Stability seems fine so far. I will have to do some initial setup for my buds so that they don’t have to learn {$x.barf$} syntax. A possibility…</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/04/30/boating.html">Boating</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Boating</strong>. The great weather makes me want to get out on a boat. And we live in a great area for it. Thankfully there is no reason to actually own a boat. There is a great market of charter options. We’ve used <a href="http://ledgermarinecharters.com/main.htm">Ledger Marine</a> here in Seattle and had great luck. Other options I’ve noticed are <a href="http://www.penmar.com/crewed.htm">Penmar</a>, <a href="http://www.cnconnect.com/charter.html">CNI Charters</a>, <a href="http://www.bellinghamyachts.com/bys/bys_5.html">Bellingham Yacht Sales</a>, <a href="http://www.abcyachtcharters.com/">ABC</a>, <a href="http://www.starellit.com/fleet.htm">Starellit</a>, and <a href="http://www.gulfislandcharter.com/">Anacortes Yacht Charters</a>. A huge range of pricing, amenities, crew options, etc. Waaaay cheaper than actually owning a boat.</p>

<p>Someday I’d like to do a charter in other parts of the world. From some of these sites you can see the market for charters in other areas, and clearly the mediterranean and caribean are active markets. I have a dream of doing Australia by boat someday…</p>

    <p><strong>Small Camera</strong>. Here’s a <a href="http://www.dynamism.com/cubik/index.shtml">cool small camera</a>.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder about the limit to size of a camera. As moore’s law drives down the size of necessary circuitry, I guess the limits to size are a) batteries, b) lens structure, and c) control surfaces. I would have in the past said storage media was a driver of size but no more, not with solid state media. Lens structure is a feature decision – how much optical zoom, size do you want. I bet batteries can get very small as designers go to low power circuits. These cameras are going to get very very small….</p>

    <p><strong>Relatives</strong>. A fun game to play on the net is to see what you can find out about your relatives. Extra points for obscurity. Not an exhaustive list below but some fun things I found out about my relatives:</p>

<p>Grandfather Cleo is a great supporter of the <a href="http://www.ohio4h.org/4hfoundation/histsupp.htm">4-H organization:</a> “4-H gave me an opportunity for accomplishment, boosted my ego and brought me out of my shell of shyness and unworthiness.” – Cleo Ludwig, Founder, L &amp; K Restaurants.</p>

<p>Sister Laura is easy to find – tons of mentions due to her job at the <a href="http://www.state.oh.us/odps/division/ems/ems_local/default.htm">Ohio Department of Public Safety</a>. Ditto Cousin <a href="http://www.bcschools.net/Administration.html">Carolyn</a>.</p>

<p>Cousin John had a stint with the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/all_time_stats/players/c/5382/">Reds</a>! Cool.</p>

<p>Cousin Susan’s efforts are apparently appreciated by the <a href="http://www.fcdp.org/office.html">Franklin Country Democrats</a>. While her husband Erick is a member in good standing of the <a href="http://home.columbus.rr.com/buckeyebeemers/reports/0002.member.html">Buckeye Beemers</a>.</p>

<p>Brother-in-law Garry Curren is on the <a href="http://www.heidelberg.edu/athletics/football/alltimeoac.html">all-time all-OAC team</a>! And is a heck of a <a href="http://www.michiganvizsla.org/w98idx.htm">dog trainer</a>. Speaking of dogs, <a href="http://www.marioncomputer.com/hutchman/">Aunt Carrie</a> is a huge dog lover too.</p>

<p>Check out the high school/middle school photo of Dad – <a href="http://www.geocities.com/schrade9/">Pictures</a>, near the bottom of the page, open the one named Paul Ludwig (if you can’t find it there, try <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Images/young%20paul.bmp">here</a>). And the <a href="http://www.pixi.com/~jharbin/classmates_58.html">high school pics</a> of Rosemary and Garry!</p>

<p>No picture for Mom, but she and dad are appreciated by the <a href="http://www.unitedwaymarion.org/bronze.htm">United Way</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>College entrance exams</strong>. Rant. Kids these days are expected to take the PSAT in their junior year to qualify for National Merit honors. SAT in the spring of their junior year for the first time. Followed by prep work, and then the SAT again in the fall of their senior year. AP tests for appropriate classes at the end of their junior year, which could mean as many as 4 more tests. SAT II tests in 3 subject areas at the end of their junior year, followed by retesting in their senior year if they feel appropriate. Some people recommend the ACT test as well as it biases in slightly different directions.</p>

<p>Issue A. The amount of time and work spent on these tests is huge. And if you want to do any prep at all, it really eats up time.</p>

<p>Issue B. The notion that a small set of numbers somehow measures a person’s potential is of course nuts.</p>

<p>Each of these tests also has all kinds of scoring options – extra cost options for faster score reporting, more detailed reporting.</p>

<p>Issue C. The system explicitly favors higher income families – retesting, prep, scoring options all add up. I guess I shouldn’t complain as this biases the system towards us but it is not right.</p>

<p>Disturbing.</p>

<p>I considered a lot of different solutions – writing a custom website to frontend my files, using pc anywhere, using the winxp remote desktop feature, putting my file server at home in the dmz of my firewall. I had a recent good experience with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/using/howto/gomobile/vpns.asp">Win XP VPN client</a> tho, it is substantially easier to use than previous versions and it is included in Win XP. And with a VPN I can keep my file server behind my firewall, and I can put the VPN server behind my firewall. And I happened to have an underutilized Win2k server box so I decided to turn it into a VPN server using the included VPN software.</p>

<p>So in I dove. I will save you all the details. Along the way I had to add another net card, reconfig my firewall to pass traffic through to the vpn server, and configure a vpn server on the win2k box. There are a lot of moving parts involved. As of this moment, I am now reformatting my WIn2k box and reinstalling the server on it, as in my first attempt I ended up with an unbootable win2k server. There are a lot of conflicting docs on the Microsoft Technet site about how to set this up right. The user interface is pretty daunting.</p>

<p>Once I have it working I will post my steps and advice up here. But for now I am deep in the bowels of Win2k Server Setup…</p>

<p>Update. Server Set up. SP2 installed. Currently installing all security patches.</p>
