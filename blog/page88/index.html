  <h1><a href="/2005/04/26/winhec-blogger-lunch.html">WInHEC blogger lunch</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>For fun, went to the WinHEC blogger lunch today. Hosted by Joe Peterson, a great guy I worked with years ago. Well attended, probably thanks to the nice lunch at <a href="http://www.tulio.com/">Tulio</a>.</p>

<p>Joe opened with a message about community – how important the blogger and developer community was to Microsoft and how important events like this are. Talked about the recent 64bit Windows release. And for longhorn, mentioned a beta in early summer, beta2 in fall, and release to manufacturing next summer.</p>

<p>Questions from the bloggers present for Joe and team:</p>

<p>* Tagging in longhorn. How does this work without WinFS? Where are tags stored (in the files as file formats permit)? What about tag collisions (bummer. some talk about per-user tags but sounded like it won’t be in the product)? Personally I don’t get the excitement about tags in the audience or among the blog community, I don’t think users really want to use tags – they just want free text search. * Sidebar? cut for now. * Working to improve multimonitor support by pulling more out of display-specific drivers and into general level. display driver stability a big goal * By default, users will operate in “protected admin” and “standard user” rights levels – prompts for installs and admin ops. * Longhorn target – work on 256m system, prob will reco 512. 1gig proc. Will work with all old drivers. * Skinnable ui? working to add more skinnable features. * Dev team is purchasing only 64bit machines going forward. Daily builds of both, will simship both, you’ll be able to choose. For my money – if the dev team is running 64bit machines, then that is what I want to run, I know they will make that work well. * Will virtualpc ship in longhorn? Looking at.</p>

<p>All in all a great lunch. Thanks Joe et al.</p>

    <p>Yet again this year we purchased a license to <a href="http://www.ridemax.com/">Ridemax</a> prior to our disneyland trip. Recommended. It is not so much the great schedules it prints out that we love – but the general data on ride wait times at various hours of the day is incredibly helpful. Knowing that there is no need to wait in the Peter Pan line midday, you can get on the ride at 11pm with just a short wait, is incredibly valuable.</p>

    <p>* The rise of developer communities targetting the hometheater experience is interesting, something I’m fascinated by. For example, this <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/844/itunes_on_your">itunes plugin for tivo</a>. Tivo2 and Windows Media Center Edition are fighting neck and neck for plugins and addons; the Mac Mini is the dark horse. There will be some real breakthrough products and companies here. * Meanwhile the cable industry is trying its best to screw up the experience – <a href="http://www.edbott.com/weblog/archives/000629.html">good posts here on their reticence around cablecards</a>. my personal experience with cablecard is terrible, in fact it has quit working at my house.

    <p>Spent a couple nice days there this week. Great weather. Here are some essential links:</p>

<p>* Getting there. <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=ana-sj&amp;direction=west">WSDOT Ferry schedules</a> – read the footnotes carefully as there are a lot of intricacies in Lopez service. If you don’t need a car on the island, <a href="http://www.paracletecharters.com">Paraclete Charters</a> is a great way to go – avoid the ferry lines, and they can drop you anywhere, and they are nice people. * Staying. <a href="http://www.lopezfarmcottages.com/">Lopez Farm Cottages</a> are delightful – clean, completely invisible staff, lots of wild bunnies to entertain you. * Eating. The <a href="http://sanjuanislands.kulshan.com/Washington/San_Juan_County/Lopez_Island/Lopez_Village/Restaurants/Love_Dog_Cafe.htm">Love Dog Cafe</a> is great – we had a great halibut dinner, they do great pizzas, good crabcakes, pastas, etc. Holly ‘s Bakery is great for deserts and pastries. Isabel’s for your coffee fix. Vita’s for takeout sandwiches, food, and wine. All these are in the village, along with the grocery store. No shortage of calores in our two days there.</p>

    <p>* “Hard Time by Sara Paretsky”:amazon. Had this book on the shelf for a while, a typical airport purchase. Didn’t expect much but was actually happy with it. A lot more depth of character than I typically find in your mass market detective novel. Worth reading more in the series. * “Stranger Things Happen by Kelly Link”:amazon. Trying to be bradbury. And occasionally hits the note. But I think I’d rather reread “the illustrated man”:amazon or “the martian chronicles”:amazon. * “The Sheltering Sky”:amazon. Ok at first I couldn’t get into this novel, I just didn’t care about these two people wandering thru northern africa. But wow, the story really engaged as the characters struggled to connect with each other and with the world, while fighting greater and greater physical hardships. No happy ending here, the story just gets grittier and better. * And I haven’t read yet but just ordered “Freakonomics”:amazon, and then saw <a href="http://brandautopsy.typepad.com/brandautopsy/2005/04/marketing_lesso.html">this great posting</a> on Brand Autopsy with some pithy lessons learned from the book.</p>

<p>Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Prescott is a gem. High desert country – great climate. Pleasantly treelined streets. Historical downtown which has largely been maintained. A little college influence. Lots of restaurants and arts for a small city. Biking, hiking trails abound. Great launch point for sidetrips to Sedona or Flagstaff.</p>

    <p>OK as anyone who has mucked around with fog machines knows, it is hard to get the fog to lie low. You can buy fog chillers or build your own, plans abound on the web.</p>

<p>But here is <a href="http://www.methodzofmadness.com/php/smf/index.php?topic=1391.new#new">a simple solution on the MOM forums</a> – basically run your fog machine output through a pile of mulch. Apparently the temperature and moistness of the mulch cool the fog enough to keep it down. Good idea, I will try this year.</p>

    <p>added a new section to my sidebar, a summary of my postings on judy’s book (an ignition investment). this is cool, i am far more likely to post at judy’s book now as i can see a summary of my activity back here on my own page. i’d love to be able to bring my judy’s book posts inline into my blog – interspersed naturally with posts i’ve done here. I guess with some coding i could do that but i am lazy, i just want some MT tags that let me aggregate posts from N places into one stream on this page.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/04/11/impressions-of-el-paso-and-juarez.html">Impressions of El Paso and Juarez</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* El paso was dusty, hot, and windy. So brown compared to seattle. * Stayed at a decent hotel in downtown el paso – <a href="http://www.caminoreal.com/elpaso_i/index.html">the camino real</a>. An oasis of higher income activity in the downtown. * Downtown lively in day – every store rolls their wares out onto the street. But absolutely dead at night. And no one speaks English – I felt like a fish out of water. * You need to head out to the northern or eastern burbs for restaurants, shopping. I ate dinner at the <a href="http://www.guestlife.com/elpaso/dine/dinestate.html">State Line BBQ</a> – it was decent. Good potato salad. * <a href="http://www.utep.edu">UTEP</a> is on some hills overlooking the downtown. Banner year for men’s sports, both the bball and fball teams did well. The <a href="http://www.sunbowl.org/">Sun Bowl</a> is played here annually. * You can walk into Juarez for 35 cents. I spent Saturday morning wandering into Juarez. I was wondering “why do people visit Juarez?”. I wasn’t 25 feet across the border before I had my first Viagra offer. The main tourist street was lined with pharmacies. At 100 feet a cab driver offered to take me to a woman. * It took about 8-10 blocks of walking to punch thru this part of Juarez into the market area with more normal shops, bakeries, restaurants, etc. Much more pleasant.</p>

<p>Net/net, can’t say I’d ever want to come to a sun bowl.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/04/10/windows-ftp-client-bad-filezilla-good.html">Windows FTP client bad, Filezilla good</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Reminded again this week how crappy the built-in ftp client in winxp is. Struggled for a day with uploading some simple cgis to a hosting service before it dawned on me that the xp client was sending them in binary mode, not ascii. I upload cgis to a windows server all the time using the xp client, apparently msft does something special between xp clients and windows servers to fix up the uploads because I never had a problem with this config.</p>

<p>And the builtin client doesn’t have a way to force ascii or binary, at least not that I could find.</p>

<p>“Filezilla”:google proved to be a great answer. Reasonable browsing ui, automatically handles ascii/binary selection for most files, handles disconnects/reconnects well.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/04/10/making-a-multi-ipod-household-work.html">Making a multi-ipod household work</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>We love ipods so much that we have four in the house.</p>

<p>And itunes really sucks at handling this. we like to keep all our music on one server and this just creates a legion of problems. Getting itunes on all machines to take notice of new music on the server. Sharing playlists across the network. Ratings collision – we all have different ratings we want to maintain. And doing different loads of music onto each ipod.</p>

<p>Here’s how we manage the last item today – getting different subsets of our collection onto each ipod.</p>

<p>* We keep all our music in one huge directory, with subdirs per artist and album. Makes backup, searching, and all other operations easier. * In itunes I create partitioning playlists. Basically a playlist per user that represents the music they want on their ipod. In our case this is fairly easy as our interests break cleanly on genre lines, and it is easy in itunes to create playlists like “female vocal OR male vocal OR new age OR holiday”. * Then I configure our respective ipods (in the itunes app) to only pick up these playlists on synch.</p>

<p>As I said it is not perfect. Ratings collide. We have to avoid fights over genre tags. I have to do tag maintenance every once in a while. But it works ok for our household.</p>

<p>I am playing around with a different approach – using <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a> to fully replicate our music collection to a bunch of individual machines, and then letting people tag and rate their music as they want on that machine and sync on that machine. This creates a whole bunch of other problems, best solved if we only rip cds on one machine in the house (which is the case today), but it does work better in some ways with itunes.</p>

    <p>A burgeoning interest area of mine is adult or continuing education. I seriously considered in the last couple years enrolling in a phd program but the traditional university structure just doesn’t work well for adults with families, jobs, etc.</p>

<p>I wonder if programs like <a href="http://www.capella.edu/default.aspx">Capella University</a> are viable.</p>

    <p>The web is an amazing thing. Saved us from a cooking disaster this weekend.</p>

<p>We hauled our rice cooker out of the small appliance graveyard in our house – wedged in between the juicer and bread machine, just in front of the waffle iron, on top of the paninni grill. Sadly tho, we had no manual for it. The cooker is like 10 years old, I figured we were hosed.</p>

<p>But hats off to Panasonic for <a href="http://service.us.panasonic.com/operman/">putting all their product manuals on the web</a>, even old ones.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/04/04/recent-books-44.html">Recent Books -- 4/4</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “The Bottomless Well: The Twilight of Fuel, the Virtue of Waste, and Why We Will Never Run Out of Energy”:amazon – One of the better nonfiction books I have read in years. If you are thinking at all about energy policy, you should read this book. Its explanation of the energy economy in our society is lucid and insightful. I’d understood intuitively for years that to create the advanced products of our modern society – cars, computers, etc – you have to start with mountains of raw materials that get refined down into a small amount of useful goods. I hadn’t intuitively grokked that the same thing happens with energy – we start with gross amounts of highly chaotic energy (running water, burning hydrocarbons) and refine them down to the highly ordered, highly valuable electrons/photons used in computers, telecom, medical equipment, etc. These authors explain this in length, and clearly articulate how technology is pushing us even more towards an electricity basis and away from raw fuels. The authors take a light hand on policy recommendations but an obvious policy question to consider – would you rather have nuke plants built in our country, or our armed forces deeply engaged in battles in oil-rich parts of the world? It is probably not a direct tradeoff, but they are not unrelated choices. * “Under the Glacier”:amazon – this is a very challenging novel. deep references to the bible, to catholicism, to nordic myth, indian myth, and probably a thousand other creation myths, religions, and philosophies that i didn’t catch. the author was incredibly well read and wrote this in his 60s – i probably need to do another 20 years of reading to be able to begin to appreciate this novel. * <a href="http://listsofbests.com/news/#000054">Another list of great novels of the 20th century</a> – nothing shocking but a good reminder list</p>
