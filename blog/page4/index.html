    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Old-Man-Thomas-Perry-ebook/dp/B01LFQ3LE4">The Old Man</a> by Thomas Perry. A lazy suspense novel, unimpressed. The action moves along ok but the characters are tissue thin. And when I see a character arrive in Vancouver on a train and “catch a cab to Victoria”, I just get pissed off, the author is just sloppy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Collapsing-Empire-Interdependency-Book-ebook/dp/B01F20E7CO">The Collapsing Empire</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Consuming-Fire-Interdependency-Book-ebook/dp/B078X255Y1">The Consuming Fire</a> by John Scalzi. Entertaining and fun, kind of an homage to Asimov’s Foundation series.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-Spoon-Madness-Periodic-Elements/dp/0316051632">The Disappearing Spoon</a> by Sam Kean. A delightful walk thru the periodic table and all of the human stories behind the elements.   Very engaging.</li>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Walkaway-Novel-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B01FQQ47OC">Walkaway</a> by Cory Doctorow.  My first Doctorow, and I am not sure I will do any more.  A hash of steampunk, cyberpunk, biohacking, post-gender, libertarian themes all jammed into a stew, and there just isn’t much story or character in there.</li>
  <li><a href="http://Less (Winner of the Pulitzer Prize): A Novel https://www.amazon.com/dp/031631613X">Less</a> by Andrew Sean Greer. Contrast with above, a great character finding himself in the middle part of his life.  Informed by the generations before and after him as they deal with their own crises.</li>
  <li><a href="http://Babel: Around the World in Twenty Languages https://www.amazon.com/dp/0802128793">Babel</a> by Gaston Dorren.  A look at each of the top 20 most used languages in the world.  And a lot of cultural insight along the way.  Very good.</li>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Plague-David-Walton-ebook/dp/B01MT6ZAS5">The Genius Plague</a> by David Walton. Award Winner, and has some great concepts, but wasn’t an amazing story. Fun but forgettable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empty-Planet-Global-Population-Decline-ebook/dp/B07CWHYVW5">Empty Planet</a> by Darrell Bricker and John Ibbitson.  Very interesting book about declining birth rates and the implications for us.  No real conclusions but thought provoking.  There are some vitriolic reviews on Amazon claiming bias, and as you read the reviews, it is clear the reviewers are heavily biased, which just made me more interested in the book.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magpie-Murders-Novel-Anthony-Horowitz-ebook/dp/B01M1G8JQE">Magpie Murders</a> by Anthony Horowitz.  Good but not great.  I love books that play with structure, but this didn’t really go anywhere with the concept.</li>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC">Good Strategy Bad Strategy</a> by Richard Rumelt. I hate pop business books but this book does not belong in that category. A timeless approach to the basics of strategy, whether in business or any other setting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Helicopter-Heist-Novel-Based-Events/dp/1590519507">The Helicopter Heist</a> by Jonas Bonnier. Gripping, the last half of the book was a rollercoaster. Looking forward to rumored Netflix treatment.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plotters-Novel-Kim-ebook/dp/B07CWDMQ45">The Plotters</a> by Un-su Kim. Thriller, a little surreal, even a bit of a parable. Interesting tho not something I would want to diet steadily on.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snap-Belinda-Bauer-ebook/dp/B075VDP295">Snap</a> by Belinda Bauer. The cover claims this book is long listed for the Man Booker Prize, and that is normally the kiss of death for me, I find the winners to be unreadable. But this is a great thriller and a lot of fun.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Agent-Daniel-Suarez-ebook/dp/B01J2SU2YO/">Change Agent</a> by Daniel Suarez.  Suarez is always super fun, this is a great tale of genetic editing and the criminal behaviours it may lead to.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf">The Mueller Report</a>.  A bit of a slog but something everyone should read.
    <ul>
      <li>I came away angrier at FB/TWIT for failing to aggressively address their roles in election interference</li>
      <li>I am angry at the Trump administration and all parts of the government for failing to aggressively defend our political system.  The identified Russian actions to manipulate our elections are certainly just the tip of the iceberg.</li>

  <h1><a href="/2019/04/26/how-much-software-should-a-car-contain.html">How much software should a car contain?</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>In a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/amp/2019/04/25/mk-8-vw-golf-software-issues/">recent article about the latest VW Golf,</a> the product manager was quoted “Already now there are ten times more lines of code in the latest Golf than in a smartphone”. This statement is interesting in some many directions.</p>

<p>Software content in a car is growing exponentially as connectivity, autonomy, sensors, new compute platforms, electrification all drive into the car and this VW metric is an interesting indicator.</p>

<p>But is that too much software? It seems like my cellphone is jammed full of software, does my car really need 10X the lines of code?</p>

<p>But then the car has at least two major compute domains (UX and drive control) with many smaller compute loads, and maybe it is reasonable to have a lot more software than a smartphone?</p>

<p>Is KLOCs the right way to measure software? That is an ’80s way of thinking about software content and leads to some very bad behavior. Should anyone be proud of this?</p>

<p>What is the quality level of that software? Modern smartphones and the services that power them have the most highly compensated people in the industry banging away on them. How should we feel about a software system with 10x the number of components but with less highly compensated engineers? What is the total lifetime cost of all that software? What is the security exposure of all the software?</p>

<p>The biggest challenge VW is struggling with is OTA updates per the article. The OTA challenge in a car is broad – firmware, headunits, apps all have their own lifecycles and OTA needs. Is there an understanding that a great architecture for OTA and application isolation in the car are probably the first things that should have been put in place?</p>

<p>How much software should be on your mobile phone and in the cloud to support your driving? More or less than is in the car itself? How does that change when your car is always connected?</p>

<p>It is fascinating time in the auto industry. Software content is growing by leaps and bounds. While the VW number may be too high today, there is going to be a LOT more software content in cars over time.</p>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Towns-000-Mile-Journey-America/dp/1101871849">Our Towns</a> by James and Deborah Fallows. An uplifting walk thru towns and cities across America, each of which is finding its way and wrestling successfully with renewal, growth, education, immigration. There is a lot of great stuff happening everywhere — we shouldn’t let the national miasma blind us. One observation they make — almost every town on an upward track has a micro brewery.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Those-Who-Knew-Idra-Novey/dp/0525560432">Those Who Knew</a> by Idra Novey. Not my usual style but a satisfying tale of a corrupt politician whose life ultimately unravels, and lifting of that weight off the people around him.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Senlin-Ascends-Books-Babel-Book-ebook/dp/B074M62D7Y">Senlin Ascends</a> by Josiah Bancroft. First in a series about a world dominated by a steampunk-ish Tower of Babel. Part allegory, part swashbuckler. A great deal of fun.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Library-Book-Susan-Orlean/dp/1476740186/">The Library Book</a> by Susan Orlean. A peek inside the history, operations, and stories behind the LA Public Library, written by someone who loves books and libraries. Really enjoyable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Civility-Novel-Amor-Towles-ebook/dp/B004IYJDVG">Rules of Civility</a> by Amor Towles. Surprisingly fantastic tale of a young woman in Manhattan finding her way in the world pre WWII. Started slow but oh my gosh did it pick up. Inspiring in many ways.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doubtful-Guest-Edward-Gorey/dp/0151003130">The Doubtful Guest</a> by Edward Gorey. Just because I needed some weird.</li>

    <p><img src="images/812bCWhIkoL-631x1024.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trains-Buses-People-Opinionated-Transit/dp/1610919025">Trains, Buses, People: An Opinionated Atlas of US Transit</a> by Christof Spieler. Oh I love maps, and this book is chock full of them, and a great overview of transit in the US. It is easy to focus just on your community and not see the big picture, this really helps to provide context. If you just read Seattle papers, you’d think Seattle is screwing up transit constantly, but this book suggests Seattle is doing a decent job at building out an effective system.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paying-Party-College-Maintains-Inequality/dp/0674088026">Paying for the Party: How College Maintains Inequality</a> by Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton. This book intrigues and aggravates me. Which means it is worth reading and thinking about. A pretty damning takedown of the mainstream college education experience. It doesn’t line up with my own experience – but I saw signs of this dark side, and maybe I just lived in ignorance due to my focus and my advantages heading into college.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/1491-Second-Revelations-Americas-Columbus-ebook/dp/B000JMKVE4/">1491</a> by Charles Mann. Great exploration of the civilizations in America before the arrival of the Europeans. I don’t think I realized just how dramatic the die off due to European diseases was, nor how as a result, the world lost cultures and civilizations that rivaled those of Asia. Sobering, sad.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Fracture-Daniel-T-Rodgers-ebook/dp/B004Z17I8M">Age of Fracture</a> by Daniel Rodgers. I really really wanted to like this book, it is well-regarded and seems to have an interesting thesis about what has happened in the last 50 years in our country. But overly wordy and repetitive, I just couldn’t stay with.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Responses-Organizations/dp/0674276604">Exit, Voice and Loyalty</a> by Albert Hirschman. What a difference from the work above. Tight, focused arguments with detailed supporting notes, with clear economic thinking. Really enjoyed this, a lot of insight into company behavior and political party behavior. Very nice.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Medusa-Uploaded-Novel-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B0756K6X32">Medusa Uploaded</a> by Emily Devenport. Starts out super strong, a laborer on a generation ship stumbles into layers and waves of conspiracy. But flags in the last third.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bannerless-Saga-Carrie-Vaughn/dp/0544947304">Bannerless</a> by Carrie Vaughn. Excellent detective tale set in a future America devastated by ecological change. The protagonist is an investigator who travels town to town, and finds herself caught up in a mystery that drags up issues from her own past.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Order-Day-Eric-Vuillard/dp/1590519698">The Order of the Day</a> by Eric Vuillard. Short history of the events leading up to the German invasion of Austria. Literary, lyrical, almost whimsical in its writing, tho undercut by the great tragedy that was unfolding. And of course the book offers pointed lessons for our own time. Easy to see why this book has won so many honors.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Here-There-Everywhere-Recording-Beatles-ebook/dp/B000OVLIQU">Here, There, and Everywhere</a> by Geoff Emerick. A personal and much more human look at the Beatles career by one of the few people who were in the room with them a lot. The book is not without bias, but still super interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/IQ-Novel-Joe-Ide/dp/0316267724">IQ</a> by Joe Ide. Fantastic first novel featuring Isaiah Quintabe, a high school dropout working cases in LA for friends and associates. Great character, great setting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electric-State-Simon-Stålenhag-ebook/dp/B07CMMH9N1">The Electric State</a> by Simon Stålenhag. Exceptional story/art/graphic novel about a strange future/alternative America, where we have let technology run amok. The art is so integral to the story, I can’t imagine the Kindle version is worth buying.</li>

    <p>I just reviewed all my books I read over the last year. Here are the ones that stick with me.</p>

<p>Fiction:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Systems-Red-Murderbot-Diaries/dp/0765397536">All Systems Red</a> by Martha Wells. The first in a super fun science fiction series</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Still-Life-Louise-Penny/dp/0312541538">Still life</a> by Louise Penny. The first in her series featuring Inspector Gamache, every entry I’ve read in the series is great.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Committee-Members-Julie-Schumacher/dp/0345807332">Dear Committee Members</a> by Julie Schumacher. Hilarious series of letters from a disgruntled professor</li>
</ul>

<p>On the nonfiction side:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-Lakes/dp/0393355551">The Death and Life of the Great Lakes</a> by Dan Egan. Won’t be everyone’s cup of tea but if you’ve spent time on the lakes, worth a read</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darkening-Age-Christian-Destruction-Classical/dp/0544800885">The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World</a> by Catherine Nixey. Probably will upset some readers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</a> by John Carreyrou. Wow, so much bad behavior by so many people.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Trump-Touches-Dies-Republican/dp/1982103124">Everything Trump Touches Dies: A Republican Strategist Gets Real About the Worst President Ever</a> by Rick Wilson. Lots of competition for books shining a light on our current “President”, this was my favorite.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Command-Control-Damascus-Accident-Illusion/dp/0143125788">Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety</a> by Eric Schlosser. Wow we have had so many near misses. And this is nuclear weapons – how much slop and error is there in other governmental and corporate processes (say, drug testing) where the stakes are much lower?</li>
</ul>

    <p>Every year we play a couple board games over the holiday season. This year’s winner was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plaid-Hat-Games-PH1000-Winter/dp/B00HFKITJC">Dead of Winter.</a> The combination of collaborative play with individual secret objectives is great – encourages a lot of dialog but you never quite know if you are hearing the truth. And the surprise changes to objectives or surprise events that happen every turn keeps everyone hoping. Not a short game to play but a lot of fun. We played with 5 people and it was perfect.</p>

Cambias.  Ugh, how did this thing get <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/12/recent-books-darkling-sea-guest-room-bring-me-back/51yqh9oi20l-_sx326_bo1204203200_/"><img src="images/51Yqh9oI20L._SX326_BO1204203200_-197x300.jpg" alt="" /></a>decent reviews?  Reads like Asimov from early 70s which I enjoyed when I was 12 but hasn’t aged well.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guest-Room-Vintage-Contemporaries/dp/0804170983">The Guest Room</a> by Chris Bohjalian.  Sad story about human trafficking and its victims, wrapped up inside a suspense novel.  A little uncomfortable at times, human trafficking is an ugly business.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bring-Me-Back-B-Paris/dp/1250151333">Bring Me Back</a> by B. A. Paris.  Marketed as a great beach read, at first I thought this was an engaging tale, and then I realized that the two protagonists are possibly the two stupidest people I have ever encountered in a novel.  Abandoned.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Army-None-Autonomous-Weapons-Future/dp/0393608980">Army of None</a> by Paul Scharre,  An examination of the issues around autonomous weapons.  Mixed feelings.  Some of the writing is very clumsy, but the discussion of the human/weapons systems integration issues are interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Fascism-Works-Politics-Them/dp/0525511830">How Fascism Works</a> by Jason Stanley.  A catalog of the mechanics of fascism (and an examination of how they are being used today).  Depressing.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Buddhas-Brain-Practical-Neuroscience-Happiness-ebook/dp/B003TU29WU">Buddha’s Brain</a> by Rick Hanson.  Another text on meditation, way better with much more underpinning and solid practical guidance.  And there is an app!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Missing-Presumed-Novel-Manon-Bradshaw-ebook/dp/B0165I3V06">Missing, Presumed</a> by Susie Steiner.  Excellent start to a detective series, central character is mid-career detective in London with a complex and messy personal life, embroiled in a high profile missing persons case.  Very good.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Little-Secret-Roz-Nay-ebook/dp/B0763TB8W1">Our Little Secret</a> by Roz Nay.  Ooh a dark little tale about obsession, betrayal.  Nicely structured.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Pale-World-Spies-Mystery-ebook/dp/B075W2V7GP">Beyond the Pale</a> by Clare O’Donahue.  Pleasant little detective jaunt set mostly in Ireland.  An appealing couple of main characters.  The MacGuffin is a little forced, but the chase for it has some fun parts.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Light-Years-Vintage-International-Salter-ebook/dp/B004G8PIOA">Light Years</a> by James Salter.  A bit of a throwback, and oh so nicely written – very very smooth.  Makes the above modern texts seem clunky.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Happened-Michael-Koryta-ebook/dp/B075CRZZRC">How It Happened</a> by Michael Koryta.  Solid thriller set in coastal Maine – murders, drugs, tawdry secrets.  Engaging</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Condition-Murderbot-Martha-Wells-ebook/dp/B075DGHHQL">Artificial Condition</a> by Martha Wells.  Gosh this MurderBot series is fun.  I want a wisecracking sidekick murderous robot.</li>

  <img src="images/candc-196x300.jpg" alt="" />Great retelling of the cholera epidemic in 1854 London, and the detective workto find the source. We look back andthe infectious mechanism for cholera seems so obvious to us – and yet we are no smarter than the people of 1854 London, we just have some accumulated science at our disposal. What will people in 2178 think about us, what are we missing today?</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1101973137">American War</a> by Omar El Akkad.  A new American civil war b reaks out in 2075.  Unthinkable!  And yet it does feel like our society is getting more rancorous.</li>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Story-Big-History-Everything-ebook/dp/B075CSMKMF">Origin Story</a> by David Christian.  <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/08/books-origin-story-new-york-2140-everything-trump-touches-dies/trump/"><img src="images/trump-199x300.jpg" alt="" /></a>Great story about the long waves of development over the entire course of history.  Focusing just on the human development part of the story, human societal development has been characterized by increasing energy consumption and increasing levels of complexity to both consume energy and to find energy.  The tale falls down a little in the last chapter though as he shifts from the story of increasing energy consumption, and now asserts that everything has to change.  But still a good read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-York-2140-Stanley-Robinson-ebook/dp/B01KT7YTO6">New York 2140</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson.  I don’t think Robinson is a great story teller or a great builder of characters, and the book was overly long, but still an interesting exploration of what our lives might be like 100+ years from now as we deal with climate change.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Trump-Touches-Dies-Republican/dp/1982103124">Everything Trump Touches Dies</a> by Rick Wilson.  This quote near the end says it all:  “<em>Everything about Donald Trump’s presidency and character is a disaster for America.  The victories Republicans think they have achieved are transitory and ephemeral and come at the cost of their principles and, probably, their immortal souls.  He is a stain on the party, on conservatism, and on this country that won’t easily wash out.</em>“  And that is the most temperate thing Wilson says about Trump.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Civil-Robert-Penn-Warren/dp/0803298013/">The Legacy of the Civil War</a> by Robert Penn Warren.  <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/07/recent-books-the-legacy-of-the-civil-war-the-power-reinventing-capitalism-imperial-twilight/itwi/"><img src="images/itwi-201x300.jpeg" alt="" /></a>The book is almost 60 years old and still super relevant.  And demands careful reading, he doesn’t cater to the reader who isn’t willing to think or work.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Naomi-Alderman-ebook/dp/B01N0Z1EY0/">The Power</a> by Naomi Alderman.  No real surprise here – absolute power corrupts absolutely, regardless of who has it.  The book is solid but over-hyped.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Capitalism-Age-Big-Data-ebook/dp/B072MF2NQJ/">Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data</a> by Viktoe Mayer-Schönberger and Thomas Ramge.  Ok the very first example in this book pissed me off and I set the book down.  Talking about a cookware purchase, the author describes a magical future where some system knows all your preferences and purchase history and just magically selects the right item for you in seconds.  And this seems like horseshit as it completely devalues design, ignores the fact that some people like shopping, ignores the value of the shopping process itself, etc.  I just didn’t care enough to read another page.  The book gets nice reviews tho.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Imperial-Twilight-Opium-Chinas-Golden-ebook/dp/B074YK9NHS">Imperial Twilight</a> by Stephen R. Platt.   The story of the Opium War.  Well written and much to learn here.  And what a great contrast to the book above.  The pop business book spins some BS tale about how humans will behave.  The deep history book examines exactly how humans did behave and reasons about how that will apply in the future.  The history book is way more insightful.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup-ebook/dp/B078VW3VM7">Bad Blood</a> by John Carreyrou. The Theranos story.  Wow. Unalloyed ambition, the worst of Silicon Valley.  Holmes and Balwani are clearly bad actors but their investors and legal partners get off too easily – they created and fed the monster.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soul-America-Battle-Better-Angels-ebook/dp/B079KV32KF">The Soul of America</a> by Jon Meacham.  Division and bigotry has been part of America forever, every generation has struggled with it.  The best of our Presidents have been unifiers and have worked to bring us together – and the country has survived the divisive demagogues, but it will take engagement and action on all our parts.  Excellent perspective.</li>

  <h1><a href="/2018/06/26/we-need-more-csny-ohio.html">We need more CSNY "Ohio"</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>CSNY’s “Ohio” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_(Crosby,_Stills,_Nash_%26_Young_song)">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRE9vMBBe10">Youtube</a> ) hits me hard every time I hear it.  I still see the bodies on the news, the classmates in anguish. “How many more” resonates through my head.</p>

<p>CSNY pushed that record out in 3 weeks.  They were at the top of their careers, already had an album for sale, but they didn’t play it safe, they made an emotional statement that resonates to this day.   I was quite young, but this event hit me hard and contributed to my suspicion of authority and power.</p>

<p>We have terrible issues in society today.  Gun violence and school shootings affecting many more people.  Inhumane treatment of desperate people at our borders.  None of the artists of today want my opinion – but too often I see artists talking at rallies and events, but it is their art that is impactful and emotional, and they could be more effective in reaching us if they spoke through their art.</p>

<p>One artist that is doing it today is Donald Glover – if you haven’t seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY">Childish Gambino - This Is America (Official Video)</a>, you should.  It is hard to watch.  I am sure there are others.</p>
