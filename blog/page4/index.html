  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109-empire-of-pain">Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe.  I did not realize how much this was a story of a marketing dynasty. A triumph of marketing and business development over morality and good sense.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247043-this-is-how-they-tell-me-the-world-ends">This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race</a> by Nicole Perlroth.  The entire internet is compromised and we better get cracking to fix it.  Our software and internet industries were created by optimists and enthusiasts, but increasingly are inhabited by bad actors.</li>
</ul>

<p>A thread across both these books – it is a great strength of our free market economy that we allow new companies to easily create new offerings and enter the market – but we don’t have great mechanisms for assigning responsibility for the societal problems they may create.  The innovators get rich and move on, society is left with the huge costs of opioid addictions or the huge costs of easily hackable software systems.  The innovators should bear more responsibility, but this is a hard problem to fix.</p>

<p>After these two books, I needed some lighter fare:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32109569-we-are-legion-we-are-bob">We Are Legion (We Are Bob)</a> by Dennis E. Taylor.  A lighthearted tale of galaxy exploration by an idiosyncratic post-human AI and its clones.  There are many more books in the series and I enjoyed, but probably won’t continue as I have too many other books on the pile:</li>
</ul>

<p>And then a transition back to more serious fare:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8247140-factory-girls">Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China</a> by Leslie T. Chang.  Deep dive into the lives of migrant workers in modern China.  A real “wild wild west” economic scene, inside of a very traditional hierarchical society.  Interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most recent one is from a very large insurance provider who should probably know better.  Their “security questions” are particularly humorous — “What is the longest book you have ever read”, “What’s your dream job”, “What’s your least favorite city”, etc.  A) I will never remember what I entered for these, B) the answers are not stable over any reasonable amount of time.  There are a lot of crappy cities I haven’t been to, a lot of books I haven’t read.</p>

				<p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life">Dare Obasanjo</a> has a <a href="https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1483073446045118464?s=20">nice post with a simple framework for evaluating job alternatives</a>.</p>

<p>It led me to reflect on my own job selection logic.  When I started my career back in the 80s, I was working in the Midwest, and it was a time of industrial restructuring and downsizing.  Layoffs were unfortunately common.  A very smart colleague at Booz-Allen, Bert Jones (who I have lost contact with), shared these simple ideas with me.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid layoffs, you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>work in the most important business (or businesses) to the company.  This means learning to read company financials and really understanding where revenues, margins, and growth comes from.</li>
  <li>and in that business, have a job either making things or selling things.  Every other job is subject to downsizing.  But if you are making or selling the most important things to the company, you are pretty safe.</li>
</ul>

<p>These points were useful more generally throughout my career.  Even when I was at Microsoft during a period of heady growth, and layoffs were not a threat, these factors impacted directly how much support I received – the closer I was to the core Windows (or Office) businesses, the more support I received, and the more opportunities I had to have an impact.</p>

<p>Of course, this also put me closer to the maelstrom, with greater focus on my performance, and that is not always the right fit, but I enjoyed it at the time.</p>

				<p><p>As an antidote to the web3 nonsense, I’ve been trying to play around with some more interesting and more fundamental innovations.  <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas">Microsoft has a really nice quantum computing tutorial</a> that I have been working my way thru.  I have enough math, quantum, electonic, and cs background to wade through.  You probably want to be reasonably comfortable with vectors and imaginary numbers or it might be frustrating.</p>

<p>I have a general impression, which is that it is very very very early in the development of quantum computing.  And that there is probably not much interesting software work to do right now.</p>

<p>Looking at the history of digital computing, we had to invent a lot of layers of technology to get to the point where it was a mass market useful thing.  We had to invent the transistor (and triode before that).  We had to combine resistors into circuits to make logic gates, coming up with some conventions that a certain voltage/current value was a “1” and another value was a “0”.  We had to invent Boolean algrebra.  We had to combine gates into higher order components like adders.  We had to move from discrete transistors to integrated circuits.  We had to develop Von Neumann machines.  We had to get to a standard system architecture of clocked cpus with memory.  We had to develop assembly language and then higher order languages like Fortran. And we had to develop a lot of tools and process technology all along the way.  All this work overlapped and moved in fits and starts, but took decades to wrangle all this together.  By the time we got to Fortran, we could write code that many humans could understand and which you could express real world problems in.</p>

<p>Without all this, writing “software” for transistors would have been terribly hard.</p>

<p>With quantum computing, we are throwing out the transistor and starting back up the stack.  We are establishing conventions for what the equivalent of a “1” and “0” is.  But the stack above that is still early or nonexistent.  We are nowhere close to a development platform that lets a lot of humans write code that is understandable and relates to a large body of real world problems.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sammck">Sam</a> pointed me to <a href="https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/quantum-computing-qubits-error-correction-no-cloning-theorem/#:~:text=Researchers%20estimate%20that%20a%20quantum,we%20can%20control%20the%20qubits">this article that says useful quantum computers may require a few million qubits</a>, and we are toying around today with systems of ~10-100 qubits.  Feels about right.</p>

<p>I am optimistic about quantum computing – today’s transistors require us to fling around a huge amount of electrons to do anything useful.  If we can get to circuit elements that can work with discrete quanta, man that will be a lot of computing performance.  But it is going to take us a while.</p>

				<p><p>I read a lot of books this year.  There were some really good ones, and I couldn’t get down to a list of just 5 ala <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Holiday-Books-2021">Bill Gates</a>.  I have 10 I would recommend.  I was mostly drawn to nonfiction about macroeconomics this year, trying to get smarter about what is really happening in the world as we seem to enter a new era of money management.   I was also drawn to some great escapist adventure stories, because well the real world has been challenging.</p>

<h3 id="economics-and-society">Economics and Society</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49644992-the-price-of-peace">The Price of Peace: Money, Democracy, and the Life of John Maynard Keynes</a> was excellent, a great telling of the factors that influenced Keynes.  I was ignorant about him and never realized how committed he was to social reform and delivering economic benefits to everyone.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44525996-escape-from-rome">Escape from Rome: The Failure of Empire and the Road to Prosperity</a> argues that the collapse of Rome gave rise to the diverse competitive structure of the West that made it so successful, and seems relevant today. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/408549.Savage_Peace">Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919</a> is an interesting look at a time period when American democracy was under great stress from pandemics and factionalism, certainly lessons for today.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385639.Secrecy">Secrecy: The American Experience</a> is something I should have read long ago, the rise of government secrecy over the last century is not good for us.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358538-a-libertarian-walks-into-a-bear">A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear: The Utopian Plot to Liberate an American Town (And Some Bears)</a> is a hilarious tale illustrating the failures of extreme libertarianism.</p>

<h3 id="adventure-and-mystery">Adventure and Mystery</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175828.Iron_Lake">Iron Lake</a> is a great mystery set in Northern Minnesota.  It was easy to imagine being there and the characters were excellent, I am very late to this book and author.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55077697-the-blacktongue-thief">The Blacktongue Thief</a> is the start of a great new series, reminded me of Fritz Leiber’s “Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser” books that I read as a kid.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360562.Sharpe_s_Rifles">Sharpe’s Rifles</a> is a book from the midpoint of this character’s series, a fun romp in the Napoleonic era.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</a> is a great space exploration and first contact tale.</p>

<h3 id="and-then-one-more">And then one more</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25584210-everything">Everything: A Book of Aphorisms</a> is a very nice compendium of wisdom.</p>
</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58181475-hell-of-a-book">Hell of a Book</a> by Jason Mott.  Great story of a writer struggling with the terrible events in his life, and the terrible toll racism has on all.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51820142-escape-from-rome">Escape from Rome</a> by Walter Scheidel.  Quite the slog but a compelling argument that the fall of Rome was essential for the creation of the competitve and progressive West.  One wonders how this dynamic will play out over the coming century.  One also wonders if this is an argument for devolving more rights and programs to the state and local level.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58036430-the-wilkes-insurrection">The Wilkes Insurrection</a> by Robbie Bach.  Really well paced and a couple of great characters.  Very good first outing from Robbie.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037-debt">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</a> by David Graeber.  The evolution of debt, markets, and money as seen by an anthropologist.  Vlad and John turned me onto this, it is a bit wordy, but super interesting, a very different view from the conventional wisdom.  I am still processing, it is very relevant to current discussions about student debt forgiveness and debt ceiling.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10842223-the-incal">The Incal</a> by Alejandro Jodorowsky, Mœbius.  Highly rated graphic novel, not really my cup of tea.  A bajillion creative concepts jammed willy nilly into one story, leaving little room for character or coherent plot.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57641615-unrequited-infatuations">Unrequited Infatuations</a> by Stevie Van Zandt.  What a life and what a character.  Greatly appreciate his passion and commitment to art.  Inspiring.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10842223-the-incal">The Incal</a> by Alejandro Jodorowsky, Mœbius.  Highly rated graphic novel, not really my cup of tea.  A bajillion creative concepts jammed willy nilly into one story, leaving little room for character or coherent plot.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57641615-unrequited-infatuations">Unrequited Infatuations</a> by Stevie Van Zandt.  What a life and what a character.  Greatly appreciate his passion and commitment to art.  Inspiring.</li>

				<p><p>I came of age and started my career in the early stages of the PC revolution.  And my gosh was this exciting — the wresting of computer power away from controlled impersonal computer centers and delivery into the hands of free individuals.  An explosion of creativity followed.  It was thrilling.  I went to work at Microsoft not because of the financial potential — I didn’t even know what a stock option was.  I went to Microsoft because I had to be part of this revolution.</p>

<p>I felt this excitment again during the web revolution — letting anyone create a website and making it dramatically easier to reach audiences.  The web was empowering and freeing.  And then the mobile revolution — pushing computing off the desk and into the hands and pockets of people, freeing and empowering again.</p>

<p>The greatest technology revolutions all share this sense of freedom and empowerment.  And during these times, mission-driven orgs pop into existence, and people commit to missions, creating career highlights.</p>

<p>There are smarter people than me who have articulated the problems with web3/crypto.  Complexity, unnecessary technology, scams, criminality, etc.</p>

<p>But ignore all the problems for a moment.  The web3 folks are articulating a vision of freedom and empowerment — freedom from giant corporate walled gardens of identity and content, freedom, to take your data anywhere.  These are good things.  I get why people are excited about freedom.</p>

<p>Is anyone else articulating a vision of freedom, empowerment, opportunity?</p>

<p>Meta is at least talking about the metaverse, but it is all locked up in Meta’s hands.  But there might be something there.</p>

<p>What bright future are Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple talking about?  They are are incrementalling their current tech, but what breakthrough are they driving in freedom and opportunity?  No one gets excited about the 723rd AWS service, or Windows/Office/Teams version 27, or iOS version 19.  Drudgery.</p>

<p>What are web3/crypto critics presenting as an alternative? It is not sufficient to say “web3/crypto sucks”.</p>

<p>Some of the smartest people I know are moving towards space startups, which has a great mission, but it doesn’t have the freedom and opportunity vibe.</p>

<p>We have to articulate an alternative vision that leads to more freedom and opportunity. Or people will continue to go down the web3 rabbithole.</p>
