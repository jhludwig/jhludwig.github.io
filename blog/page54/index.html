I love the idea of embedding cheap electronics into our electrical system – I’d really love it if somehow my switches and outlets could all report current energy use; that would help me start to change behaviour re conservation.</p>

    <p>* “The Brothers Karamazov”:amazon by Dostoevsky. Trying to understand Russian culture but this book didn’t do it for me, gave up after 15% or so. Mindless trudging thru minutiae just wore me out. * “The Greatest Battle”:amazon by Andrew Nagorski. Recounting of the WWII battle for Moscow, with a lot of emphasis on the leadership and missteps of Stalin and Hitler. Millions of troops involved, casualties heading towards 2 million, 25 miles outside of Moscow. The scale and import of this battle are hard to comprehend. The tragedy of Russian life and yet endurance of the Russian people comes out strongly.</p>

<p>Both read on the Kindle by the way. Still very happy with this device.</p>

I had to go twiddle a BIOS setting having to do with legacy USB support. The Drobo folks claim this is the BIOS manufacturer’s fault and assert that other mass storage USB devices will fail as well. However I have had no problems with a variety of generic USB housings and with a LaCie box so I don’t think the Drobo folks have this really figured out yet. Additionally the Drobo software decided to grab drive M for their use which was bad as I already had a network drive mapped to M. So that was chunky and painful.</p>

<p>The box seems to work fine now tho.</p>

<p>In my first real job, a wise mentor who had lived through recessions and layoffs gave me this advice:</p>

<p>* Make sure you are working on a product that your company cares about. “Cares about” is generally equivalent to “important to the company’s overall profitability”. If the company doesn’t care that much what happens to your product/business, well, that is not good. * You can either make things or sell things. These are the two functions that are relatively impervious to layoffs. If you are not directly involved in the making or the selling of your company’s product/service, well, also not good.</p>
