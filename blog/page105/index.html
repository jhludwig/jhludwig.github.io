<p>hmm, this seems unfortunate. it is not clear to me i want a lot of storage innovation on the client, that just seems to lead to more stateful clients, i’ve been trying to extract locked up state from my clients for years. i want more storage in the cloud, available and usable from any client machine i happen to be at.</p>

    <p>p. Hey I needed a goofy t-shirt recently and found <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/">Zazzle</a>. Very easy to create my own shirt, easy to upload graphics, and the t-shirt shipped 1 day later and arrived fast. Great service, good range of products, very easy web-based design tool. Oh and very economic to order quantity 1.</p>

<p>p. I also considered <a href="http://www.designashirt.com">Designashirt</a> and it probably had even nicer web-based design tools (flash based as i recall) but they had a minimum order of 6. But the web experience was good.</p>

I guess it was my riveting testimony that drove the parties to settle. I was subpoena’d by Sun to testify and was asked a bunch of questions about my job back in ‘95 thru ‘97. Mostly questions about java vms, class libs, etc. Who can remember all this crap? By my rough calculation, I spent well under 1% of time at Microsoft worrying about java, and since leaving Microsoft in ‘99 I’ve started a company, invested in close to 30 other companies, seen hundred of business plans, learned a bunch of new technologies, had a very busy personal life, etc. I can’t remember what JNI is let alone why I might have ever cared about it.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/03/29/readings-on-software-industry-structure-and-economics.html">Readings on Software Industry structure and economics</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>A collection of readings on software industry structure and economics. The common themes to me are that there is a still a lot of confusion and uncertainty about the way the industry works and will evolve, and there are still a lot of changes taking place in the industry, all of which means it is a great time for innovators and risk takers.</p>

<p>* As <a href="http://www.oliviertravers.com/archives/2004/03/10/ms_outlook_keeps_growing_as_a_platform_what_portals_should_do/index.php?atom">Olivier Travers</a> and <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/03/19/outlook_as_a_pl">Anil Dash</a> point out, Outlook has become a platform – though not as Microsoft expected – people aren’t building workflow apps using the built-in forms and programming language, rather they are doing simple integration with the UI, targetting the huge installed base. APIs don’t make a platform – installed base makes a platform. * Two pretty smart guys, David Stutz and Ray Ozzie, are discussing the <a href="http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2004/03/23.html#a118">rise and fall of platforms</a>. Some gems in here – <em>I would assert that every “pure software” company that has had large-scale success first offered their customers enhanced productivity in the form of packaged proprietary software, followed later by a redefinition of that software as a platform to be used by customers for rapid customization and their extensibility needs.</em> and <em>New platform efforts that set out to be highly modular or deeply object-oriented from day one are doomed to fail, because they are recognized as being vulnerable to cloning by potential ecosystem members and are consequently not adopted because of their lack of business potential. Truly useful standards always come after the fact, and often without a formal standardization process. Successful platforms ossify, leaving standardized patterns of information in their wake.</em> * David and Ray referred to Clayton Christensen, whose latest <a href="http://www.windley.com/2004/03/16.html#a1105">talk was reported on by Phil Windley</a>. Interesting counsel for startups. * Over at marginal revolution, the <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/03/microsoft_bundl.html">double monopoly</a> problem – perhaps we are better off with Microsoft bundling the browser in the OS – it certainly has helped created (or at least not hindered) the opportunity for the current toolbar wars, search engine wars, rss reader wars. * Additional open source encroachment – now <a href="http://www.beyondvc.com/2004/03/open_source_rou.html">routers have an open source alternative</a>, just as clients, servers, apps, and devices have alternatives. * Offshoring and globalization observations from <a href="http://www.windley.com/2004/03/17.html#a1107">Ray Lane via Phil Windley</a> -- <em>No matter what your politics are, you have to decide where you stand on free markets and globalization. India and China have focused on Math and Science over the last 25 years and we can either use them of someone else will. If we don’t, we’ll be France.</em> * I need to read <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/03/power_laws_and_.html">Ross Mayfield’s post on power laws and private equity</a> about 5 more times. I think it is saying something fundamental about the nature of private equity investing but there are so many ideas in this article that I can’t come to a clear conclusion – fatter tails, greater interdependence, faster shifts, greater exploration of alternatives – there is a lot of stuff in this article.</p>

    <p>I don’t understand how the music industry is going to evolve, but I sure love artists that are attempting experiments and not just sitting back and letting the RIAA lob bombs at everyone.</p>

<p>Kudos to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/29/technology/29prince.html?ex=1395896400&amp;en=20da5cbf305c1027&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Prince for his own music store</a>, I loved his original body of work and am going to have to give him a try again.</p>

<p>And kudos to Jay-Z I think – the <a href="http://www.jayzconstructionset.com/">Jay-Z construction set</a> is totally cool, allows users to build their own mixes. I’m not sure if Jay-Z actually sanctions this work, maybe he hates it. But letting users interact more deeply with the music seems like a great way to add value to music and thereby encourage people to buy it.</p>

<p>As with software, I just don’t have time to try all this stuff. Installation and config is so time consuming. If these guys all want me to continue to be a healthy consumer of gadget gear, they better be hammering on integration and config features. I want devices that autorecognize all the crap i already have, slot themselves in nicely, grab the right state data from my existing config automagically, and require absolutely minimal cabling.</p>

<p>All these great packages and I haven’t tried a one. Why? I am a huge consumer of software and am generally willing to install anything. The impediment is state management. Increasingly I use 5-6 machines interchangeably on a regular basis – 2 at work thru a KVM, 3 or 4 at home in different places, and public machines at other workplaces, hotels, etc. It is not helpful to have an app installed on just one machine – and it is too time consuming to install it on all. Really I want to install stuff just once, on my webserver, and have it be available on any machine that I work from. I am a bleeding edge PC user but I think this is going to become a more prevalent issue for all consumers…</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/03/25/offshoring.html">Offshoring</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Some recent posts – <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2004/03/22.html#a4466">Marc Andreessen explains comparative advantage</a> on John Robb’s blog. Also goes on to explain <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/stories/2004/03/22/marcAndreessenOnAmericanStrengths.html">what the US’s comparative advantages may be.</a> Per Tyler Cowen, <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/03/outsourcing_in_.html">small businesses are outsourcing too</a>.</p>

<p>These mostly have me thinking about this question: What guidance should we be giving our college-age and high-school-age kids as they think about their educational and career paths? Offshoring/globalization/whatever you call it is going to be a big fact of their lives. Complaining about it is like complaining about gravity; you just have to embrace it and learn how to use it to your advantage. Some of the points of guidance I am formulating:</p>

<p>* Educate yourself to the top of the world. A bachelor’s degree by itself doesn’t cut it. Plan on a masters or phd. Take advantage of today’s higher standard of living here in the US and spend more money and a longer time on education.</p>

<p>* Be multi-lingual. The US has historically not emphasized language education. It might be more important now.</p>

<p>* Consider the fusing of multiple domains in education. In a world where everyone has a batchelor’s, expertise in two domains will still stand out and be valuable. Engineering AND economics, materials science AND computer science, materials science AND law, etc. I know in my own case having MSs in both business and engineering made a huge difference in the number of job offers I received as well as average salary offer – that will only be more true in the future.</p>

    <p>Interesting study at <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/03/income_inequali.html" title="Marginal Revolution: Income inequality over time">Marginal Revolution: Income inequality over time</a>: <em>War and other disruptions appear to damage capital income more than labor income. If that is the case, a healthy and peaceful society might have increasing income inequality. In other words, if we are lucky, income inequality will increase even more.</em></p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/03/16/coca-cola-brands.html">Coca-Cola Brands</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I was reading the <a href="http://ir.thecoca-colacompany.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=94566&amp;p=irol-reports">Coca-Cola annual report</a> tonight. What was most interesting to me was the partial list of all the brands they have worldwide.</p>

<p>* <em>Diet Pop</em>. Now that is marketing magic. Ditto <em>187168</em>. * <em>Bimbo Break</em>. I guess we know the target market for that one. * <em>Diet Almdudler, Drim, Tuborg Squash</em>. Now don’t those sound refreshing? * <em>Beat, Burn, Hit, Shock,</em> and <em>Slap</em>. For the masochists in the crowd. * I knew about <em>Dr. Pepper</em> and <em>Mr. Pibb</em>, but did you know about their buddies <em>Disney Winnie the Pooh, Fraser &amp; Neave, Master Chill, Master Pour, Mickey Mouse, Pepe Rico</em>, the <em>Pocket Dr.</em>, the <em>Robinson Brothers</em>, <em>Samantha</em>, and the <em>Thextons</em>? * <em>Chivalry</em> and <em>Neverfail</em> sound very uplifting. * Combine <em>Ripe N Ready</em> and <em>Love Body</em>, which via a <em>Wink</em>, leads to an <em>Urge</em>, and then <em>Joy</em> – but don’t forget <em>Safety First</em>. * <em>Chaudfontaine, Diet Inka Kola, Guarana Jesus, Jurassic Well, Sparletta Iron Brew, Water Salad</em>. No idea what these are, but I’d buy a can of any of them in a second.</p>
