  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Mercy-Imperial-Radch-Leckie/dp/0316246689">Ancillary Mercy</a> by Ann Leckie. Third in the series and it is still holding up. Fascinating far future tale of empire and intrigue with a very unique set of ideas about identity.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Verificationist-Novel-Donald-Antrim/dp/0312662149">The Verificationist</a> by Donald Antrim. Very well written, the self-absorbed main character is having a breakdown or trip, and you are along for the ride.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moxyland-Lauren-Beukes-ebook/dp/B01922I24M">Moxyland</a> by Lauren Beukes. Eh, near future spread of technology through the less developed world. Some nice ideas but ultimately bored me.</li>

  <p>We eat pancakes to escape loneliness, yet within moments we want nothing more than our freedom from ever having so<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2015/12/we-promise-ourselves-that-we-will-know-better-next-time-than-to-order-pancakes-in-any-size-or-in-any-amount/veri/"><img src="images/veri.jpeg" alt="veri" /></a> much as thought about pancakes. Nothing can prevent us, after eating pancakes, from feeling the most awful regret. After eating pancakes, our great mission in life becomes the repudiation of the pancakes and everything served along with them, the bacon and the syrup and the sausage and coffee and jellies and jams. But these things are beneath mention, compared with the pancakes themselves. It is the pancake—Pancakes! Pancakes!—that we never learn to respect. We promise ourselves that we will know better, next time, than to order pancakes in any size or in any amount. Never again will we be tempted by buckwheat or buttermilk or blueberry flapjacks. However, we fail to learn; and the days go by, two or three weeks pass, then a month, and we forget about pancakes and their dominion over us. Eventually, we need them. We crawl back to pancakes again and again.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Dogs-Kent-Anderson/dp/0553578774">Night Dogs</a> by Kent Anderson. This is a rough book – a rough tale, written roughly, edited roughly. All that said, it is compelling though not always easy to stomach.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wraeththu-Storm-Constantine/dp/0312890001">Wraeththu</a> by Storm Constantine. I just don’t know about this.

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Thank goodness the season has started, and in robust fashion for Ohio State! The program is in great hands and great things are expected. How about your program? This time of year everyone is always filled with great hope for their team, but dreams will soon be dashed (in WSU’s case, horribly so). Unfortunately, some programs are destined for disappointment because they are fundamentally on the wrong strategy, mostly because demographics have passed them by.</p>

<p>I’ve been trading some notes with my other college football buddies, and we’ve articulated the 5 ways that a program can succeed in the modern era:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Be in a region with a large natural talent base</strong>. Southern regions are best for this — Florida, Texas, Southern California – and US demographics continue to flow this way. Neighboring schools in Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Arizona can get in on this too. There are a few northern regions that also qualify — Ohio &amp; environs, Northern California (not well exploited), Chicago, Boston-Washington corridor (not well exploited). This strategy works because most players like to stay somewhat close to home – because they are young, because they want family to see them. The best schools following this strategy also generate enough of a profile to allow them to recruit nationally for top talent. <strong>Schools in any other region cannot follow this strategy</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>the sugar daddy approach</strong>. This is the Oregon strategy — make an insane investment in the program so that you can draw kids from anywhere who are wowed by your staff and facilities. Oklahoma State is trying this with T Boone. Maryland may try this with UnderArmour. Any school can try this if they have a sugar daddy. (I am sure Nebraska has tried this, but they should be groveling at Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger’s feet).</li>
  <li><strong>the system approach</strong>. Focus on a particular type of 3 star talent that is available near you and nationally, and build a system to optimize that talent. This is the Tom Osborne era Nebraska strategy, the RichRod/WVU strategy, the Chris Peterson/Boise strategy. This can be very successful but requires a strong individual and strong culture. It is fragile and tends not to survive coaching changes. Any school can try it.</li>
  <li><strong>the academic excellence approach</strong>. Be a top 5-10 institution but leave an admissions door open for athletics. This is the Stanford, Northwestern approach. <strong>Your typical school cannot follow this approach</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>The Notre Dame strategy</strong>. To a lesser extent the BYU strategy. Be the favorite choice for a particular demographic segment. <strong>Not generally available to other schools</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the options. Nothing else seems terribly viable. Now it is interesting to look at various schools that I follow and see how they line up against that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>USC, Ohio State are on strategy 1 and generally executing well. USC was better in the last decade at it, OSU may be better this decade.</li>
  <li>Michigan. A confused program. They are trying strategy 1 but the demographics have run away from them. Is Harbaugh the guy to build a system approach? He doesn’t think that way and he is a demonstrated mercenary. Hmm.</li>
  <li>Washington. Perhaps also confused. While the Northwest has had great population growth, I don’t think it has translated into great high school football growth. Yet Washington is trying strategy 1, tho they hired a strategy 3 coach. An interesting experiment.</li>
  <li>Nebraska. Years of coaching changes have left them adrift, the Osborne era system has been torn down. They need to figure out how to recommit to that strategy.</li>
  <li>It is interesting that Cal has never been able to capitalize on the bay area talent base.</li>
  <li>It is interesting that no one has capitalized on the Northeast talent base. It will be very interesting to follow Maryland with their Underarmour ties, a potential double whammy strategy.</li>
</ul>

				<!-- <p><p>Thank goodness the season has started, and in robust fashion for Ohio State! The program is in great hands and great things are expected. How about your program? This time of year everyone is always filled with great hope for their team, but dreams will soon be dashed (in WSU’s case, horribly so). Unfortunately, some programs are destined for disappointment because they are fundamentally on the wrong strategy, mostly because demographics have passed them by.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misterioso-Crime-Novel-Vintage-Lizard/dp/0307388034">Misterioso</a> by Arne Dahl. I’m not sure what the state of the art in book translation is these days, but I am sure it is heavily automated. This story is ok, but feels like a rush translation job – some strange and stale structuring, some pronoun confusion at times. I suspect the original is better than this.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orenda-Joseph-Boyden/dp/034580645X">The Orenda</a> by Joseph Boyden. Life during the 1600s in the Americas from the viewpoint of a Huron tribe. Fascinating milieu and great characters. Not for the squeamish, life was brutal.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gates-Samuel-Johnson-Tale-ebook/dp/B002QJZ9Y0">The Gates</a> by John Connolly. Suburban idlers accidentally open the gates to Hell, and it is up to young Samuel Johnson to save the day. Kind of funny but forgettable.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rolling-Deep-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B00VR2L60S">Rolling in the Deep</a> by Mira Grant. Light Horror, don’t screw around with mermaids, they are not what they seem. Fun, but I mostly read because Grant has done such other good work.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Finders-Keepers-Novel-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B00P42WROG">Finders Keepers</a> by Stephen King. A fine detective novel, but makes me miss the glory days of the author.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Girl-All-Gifts-M-Carey-ebook/dp/B00CO7FLFG">The Girl With All The Gifts</a> by M. R. Carey. Not all zombies are bad. Not all people are good. Maybe we should just let the zombies win.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Pass-Resurrection-Man-Novel-ebook/dp/B00TONI5LU">Snake Pass</a> by Colin Campbell. An attempt to start a Jack Reacher-like franchise, and not a bad attempt. I will read the next.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Novel-Book-1-ebook/dp/B0052RDJAO">Legend</a> by Marie Lu. Yet another post-apocalyptic dystopia. Probably better than most, but I don’t know that I need another series in this genre.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Caine-Riordan-Book-ebook/dp/B00BVBRMDK">Fire with Fire</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trial-Fire-Caine-Riordan-Book-ebook/dp/B00LUXNAYO">Trial by Fire</a> by Charles E. Gannon. Fun space romp with aliens, world-ending threats to humanity, interstellar politics, etc.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Character-David-Brooks/dp/081299325X">The Road to Character</a> by David Brooks. The opening essay (largely reprinted in the NY Times a while back) was terrific, but the character studies themselves were only OK. I would have preferred to see some more contemporary stories. Tho the message got through – building great character doesn’t come easily to anyone, it is a lifelong daily struggle, confronting and overcoming the weaker parts of your nature.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matchbox-Theatre-Thirty-Short-Entertainments/dp/194114750X">Matchbox Theatre</a> by Michael Frayn. A quick read, some gems, but grew a little old.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mists-Avalon-Marion-Zimmer-Bradley/dp/0345350499">The Mists of Avalon</a> by Marion Zimmer Bradley. Been on the shelf forever. Good read from a very different viewpoint, I’m not sure I could have waded thru yet another typical retelling of the story.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Divers-Adventure-Americans-Everything/dp/0375760989">Shadow Divers</a> by Robert Kurson. Great true story about deep sea divers after a mysterious U-boat. Great characters, life and death drama, an excellent window into a world I knew little about.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pirate-Hunters-Treasure-Obsession-Legendary/dp/1400063361">Pirate Hunters</a> by Robert Kurson. An attempt to capture the magic again of Shadow Divers. A fine story but pales next to Shadow Divers.</li>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I installed the <a href="http://canary.is/">Canary</a> home monitoring cam this am.</p>

<p>It is positioned as “Smart Home Security for Everyone”. It is about an 8” tall sleek cylinder with a usb power connection. Key product details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HD camera with wide-angle lens + mic. Purportedly also has night vision support.</li>
  <li>wifi or ethernet backhaul. If you choose wifi, rather than doing the private wifi network dance that many of these devices do, you use a provided audio mic cable and the smartphone app. the smartphone app sends setup info over the audio cable using modem protocols. it seems simpler than the wifi dance.</li>
  <li>smartphone app</li>
  <li>temperature, humidity, airquality monitor. also accelerometer, i guess you can monitor whether it is moved?</li>
  <li>90 db alarm. this only activates if you ask it to from the smartphone app.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have several <a href="http://canary.is/plans/">plan options</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free: last 12 hours recorded, 5 clips in the cloud permanently. so this seems better than dropcam free tier.</li>
  <li>$10/month: last 7 days always available, 50 clips stored permanently. dropcam-ish – i.e. egregiously expensive app-specific storage</li>
  <li>$20/month: last 30 days available, 100 video clips stored permanently. In case you wanted even more egregiously expensive storage</li>
  <li>$40/month: last 90 days available, 250 clips stored permanently. And even more.</li>
  <li>for an additional $10/month they will hook you up to call center monitoring. i imagine that video is not sent to call center, just events (i.e. akin to existing home security systems). This seems like competitive pricing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initial Reactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>install was painless. i like the audio cable approach. tho if the device has a camera, why do you need an audio cable at all — why can’t you just display a sequence of QR-codes (or equivalent) on the smart phone app.</li>
  <li>it really struggles to deliver HD video over wifi. lots of frame drops. the video is close to unusable as a result. There must be a compression choice that could address this.</li>
  <li>it uses your smartphone location to auto switch from home to away mode. i.e. when i am in the house, it notes events, but doesn’t send me alerts. when i leave house, it will start sending me alerts. this is nice.</li>
  <li>it has a “privacy” mode where camera and mic are disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a much more focused and complete security solution than drop cam — alarm, remote monitoring service, etc. Setup was simple. I could see replacing my dropcam with this.</p>

<p>It is still tho terribly expensive. The frame dropping issue is a problem. There might be some robustness issues, I’ve had some problems reliably connecting to my streams. If the quality improves tho this might be a good step up.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/buderus.jpg"><img src="images/buderus.jpg" alt="buderus" /></a>I spent the morning decoding error messages and tracing water lines for my radiant heat boiler. Initially the codes told me that I had insufficient water pressure on the feed line, and when I fixed that, then the boiler said that the output temperature was not responding as expected – likely because I left the resupply line open, and was trying to heat up a very large body of cold water. Or maybe not, because there is supposed to be a backflow valve preventing that. Whatever, I am operational again after downloading two very large manuals and learning more about burner error codes and operations than I ever wanted to.</p>

<p>This was on top of a separate plumbing issue we’ve been wrestling with for a month.</p>

<p>I don’t think most people want to spend time on the electricity, water, hot water, sewer, or other utilities. They just want it all to work when they hit the button. And are willing to spend a little bit of money to make that happen. Most people just want centrally supplied and centrally managed utilities. To switch to local supply/generation/storage, the savings have to be incredibly dramatic, or you have to value your time at a very low rate, or there must be no central alternative (ie off-grid locations). I am dubious that this will ever be the case in urban/suburban US or other major economies.</p>

<p>I also don’t want a 200 pound lump of lithium in my garage.</p>
