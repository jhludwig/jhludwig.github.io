<p>But I’ve always thought that remote sensing without video (and to a lesser degree audio) is uninteresting. The first thing you want to do when a remote event is triggered is see exactly what is going on. Without that, remote sensing is just kind of frustrating. I’ve tried Wally and Smartthings and every other kind of remote sensor, the only thing that has stuck is Dropcam because it lets me see what is going on.</p>

<p>It is why cameras and video is at the heart of what we are doing at <a href="http://www.surround.io">Surround.io</a> – vision is fundamental, and solving the hard scale issues of video processing, storage and transmission puts you in a great position to deal with other types of sensor data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perkins says <strong>he’s “all in” on Apple products</strong> from the iPhone to Apple TV. And, in his line of work, he has to <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lemming.jpg"><img src="images/lemming-300x225.jpg" alt="lemming" /></a>stay abreast of important tech trends.</p>

  <p>But the main reason he’s an early adopter of the Apple Watch? “It’s the perfect sports watch,” said Perkins who plans to wear it while jogging. He’ll also wear it the office for the notifications that remind him to get to meetings on time and as a conversation piece.</p>

  <p><strong>“I will have that showpiece that everyone wants to see,” Perkins said. “I’ll be that guy for a couple of weeks.”</strong></p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Pradeep-Mathew-Novel/dp/1555976115">The Legend of Pradeep Mathew</a> by Shehan Karunatilaka. Very nicely written, but ultimately defeated me. My lack of any cricket knowledge and lack of any Sri Lanka knowledge put me in too deep a hole.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Speech-Child-44-Trilogy/dp/0446402419">The Secret Speech</a> by Tom Rob Smith. Excellent pageturner, not surprising, Smith writes engaging tales.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-Edgar-Sawtelle-Novel-P-S/dp/0061374237">The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</a> by David Wroblewski. I enjoyed, kind of an extended Greek tragedy set in rural Wisconsin. With dogs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Man-Vol-Unmanned-ebook/dp/B0064W66EC">Y: The Last Man</a> by Brian K Vaughan, Pia Guerra, Jose Marzan Jr. I don’t read many graphic novels but this got such great reviews, and it is a great tale. Every male human and male animal dies off suddenly, except for one, and the race is on to save and recreate the world. This would be a fantastic TV show, tho I’d tame down some of the comic parts a little.</li>

				<p><p>I see I can pre-order a <a href="https://tessel.io/">Tessel 2</a> now. Interesting part, it is nice that wifi is built in, and they have the same entry price as the pi, and they seem to be more focused on embedded solutions, with a lot of messaging around pricing and use for embedded. But no GPU on this chip which seems unfortunate, unless I am missing something. And no camera port, usb only. This might or might not be ok, tho part of the RPI’s appeal is the camera port dumping right to GPU ram with no use of the limited usb/io bus.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.spark.io/">Spark Electron</a> is another interesting device, built in low cost cellular plan, which is very nice. I am compelled to trial one just for that. Now this is a much more compute limited device than the others, but a great idea.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Different-Escaping-Competitive-Youngme-Moon-ebook/dp/B0036S4CNE">Different</a> by Youngme Moon. I hate most business books but this one was refreshing. Relatively agjron free, short, and with a clear point of view about how to innovate and stand out.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dissolution-Shardlake-Novel-Matthew-ebook/dp/B002TZ3EPM">Dissolution</a> by C. J. Sansom. Great Tudor era mystery. Very sorry that TV production on this stalled years ago, this would be awesome.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions-ebook/dp/B00IYUYF4A">What If?</a> by Randall Munroe. The perfect bathroom book.</li>
