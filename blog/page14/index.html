				<p><p>Google has announced <a href="https://developers.google.com/brillo/">Brillo</a> which leverages Android and Linux. But no, wait, now there is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/13/google-fuchsia-operating-system/">Google Fuchsia</a> because apparently Linux isn’t good enough. On the pi there are a jillion variants of linux to use, but with glaring holes (general purpose gpu, docker for instance). ARM has <a href="https://www.mbed.com/en/platform/mbed-os/">mbed</a> tho it is really targetted at low end devices. You can try <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot">Windows 10</a>. And all of these require a lot of laborious tinkering.</p>

<p>To say nothing of the cloud, the services for managing ARM devices are even more nascent or non-existent.</p>

<p>You have to wonder what Softbank is going to do about this. A $32B hardware bet needs a corresponding software and services bet.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="https://twitter.com/natbro">Nat</a> reminds me that I didn’t even mention toolchains! Cross-compilers, QEMU, etc – there is so much fun in here!</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Comcast must love our household. We have to be in the top tier of cable subscribers – multiple TVs, all DVRs, the most premium and sports channels we can get. Partly inertia, partly because we have been economically fortunate, partly because I want to get all the live HD football I can get. Comcast marketers must sit around salivating about us and wondering how to create more customers like us (or at least hang on to us).</p>

<p>So why is the Comcast/NBC Olympics coverage the worst possible option for viewing live Olympics? The 100M dash was what finally killed me. CBUT had it live. I could have found it on streaming live. NBC and Comcast in their infinite wisdom showed it at who knows what time last night. NBC had far more important things to show like prelim heats of some 800M race, also probably on tape delay. We found 5 minutes of worthwhile content in the first two hours of NBC Olympic coverage, thank goodness we could fast forward through it all.</p>

<p>By any measure the traditional cable NBC Olympics viewing is the worst possible option, which is so strange given the pile of money I give Comcast each month. The clear message is “If you want to watch live Olympics, you should not choose NBC or a cable subscription”. <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2014/02/comcast_merger_editorial_carto.html">Comcast why would you treat your best customer this way?</a></p>

				<p><p>I was asked this recently. I draw from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/section/books?action=click&amp;contentCollection=arts&amp;region=navbar&amp;module=collectionsnav&amp;pagetype=sectionfront&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">NYTimes Sunday Book Reviews</a>. I especially enjoy the “By The Book” column, in which a living author talks about what they have read and are reading. Always some things off the beaten path there.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/reviews/">LA Times</a> book reviews are useful as well.</li>
  <li>Various prize lists – Hugo, Nebula, Man Booker, Pulitzer, Nobel, Edgar. Tho I have found the Nobel prize winners to be rough rough going.</li>
  <li>Goodreads reviews and Amazon reviews. If a book doesn’t get great consensus reviews (or at least a strong positive rating from a subset of readers), I probably won’t read.</li>
  <li>I have a couple coworkers/friends who are big readers and I listen to their recos, and my college roommate is a voracious and critical reader, and I listen to him. And then anything that a family member recommends, I will consider.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will read just about any genre with a couple limitations. I find most popular business books to be horrible – 1 or 2 good ideas that are worthy of an article, but nothing worthy of a book. And I do not enjoy farce in any genre, just not my thing.</p>

The stories behind some of the most unusual and unlikely places on the globe – places belonging to no nation, to many nations, floating, underground, in the sky – and an understanding of the meaning and importance of place.  Enjoyable.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rook-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316098809">The Rook</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stiletto-Novel-Files-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316228044">Stiletto</a> by Daniel O’Malley. Great suspenseful adventure in a world filled with magic –  kind of a grown-up Harry Potter milieu.  The first page grabs you – the protagonist awakens with no memory, in a park surrounded by bodies, and in her pocket is a note that says “Read Me”. Stiletto isn’t quite as strong but still a fund read.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dispatches-Pluto-Found-Mississippi-Delta-ebook/dp/B00UDCNM82">Dispatches From Pluto</a> by Richard Grant. An English adventure writer decides to settle in the Mississippi Delta. Interesting look at the culture and issues of a part of the country that seems almost foreign to me.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Stars-Peter-Heller-ebook/dp/B007GZELF2">The Dog Stars</a> by Peter Heller. A different kind of post-apocalyptic novel, the world has largely been emptied out, a very few people try to find their way and remain human.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangeness-my-Mind-novel-ebook/dp/B00SPVZA4C">A Strangeness In My Mind</a> by Orhan Pamuk. Tried to lift my literary sights, but as always, “Nobel Prize Winning” does not equal “interesting”.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Niceville-Trilogy-Vintage-Crime-Lizard/dp/030774535X">Niceville</a> by Carsten Stroud. Not a nice place. Solid horror/mystery.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Season-Broken-Earth/dp/0316229296">The Fifth Season</a> by N. K. Jemison. A small set of related characters finding their way on a far-future(?) Earth peopled by humans and human derivatives, littered with the artifacts of past civilizations, undergoing yet another seismic/volcanic reshaping. Of course there is some conspiracy at work. Good tale, characters dealing with painful issues.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/06/recent-books-29/connectography/"><img src="images/connectography.jpg" alt="connectography" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Connectography-Mapping-Future-Global-Civilization/dp/0812988558">Connectography</a> by Parag Khanna. How the world is moving beyond nation-states to clusters driven by interconnectivity. Well written and a lot of maps, and I am a sucker for maps.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruins-Gorlan-Rangers-Apprentice-Book/dp/0142406635">The Ruins of Gorlan</a> by John A. Flanagan. Pretty standard YA fantasy, but fun nevertheless. I’d read more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Call-Novel-Yannick-Murphy-ebook/dp/B004MMEIVE">The Call</a> by Yannick Murphy. Eh, what started out as a clever structural gadget became tiring. I am a little curious to know what happens to the family but I gave up.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Novel-Kate-Atkinson-ebook/dp/B008TUQ60G">Life After Life</a> by Kate Atkinson. I like Atkinson, but this book also became tiresome, tho I managed to finish. But I’d recommend a different Atkinson.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farthing-Small-Change-Jo-Walton-ebook/dp/B002LA0ANO">Farthing</a> by Jo Walton. How did I miss this? Conspiracy, murder in the English countryside in an alternative history where Britain made peace with the Nazis. Excellent.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Those-Who-Wish-Me-Dead-ebook/dp/B00FPQA76Q">Those Who Wish Me Dead</a> by Michael Koryta. A boy witnesses a murder, and, well, shit happens. Fun but not memorable.</li>

Highly praised, but it felt to me like the author was trying very hard to be literary. I stuck with it, but it didn’t really move me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Uprooted-Naomi-Novik-ebook/dp/B00KUQIU7O">Uprooted</a> by Naomi Novik. A captivating tale of a young witch coming of age and getting drawn into an existential threat for her homeland. Really loved it, deserves the accolades.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Little-Lies-Liane-Moriarty-ebook/dp/B00HDMMISA">Big Little Lies</a> by Liane Moriarty. Completely fun story of conflicts between parents at a preschool, hilarious but serious. Apparently coming to HBO, this will be fun</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burglars-Guide-City-Geoff-Manaugh-ebook/dp/B00V35U0TM">A Burglar’s Guide To The City</a> by Geoff Manaugh. A look at how burglars use urban design and building design to achieve their goals. Would have been even better with more anecdotes, but still interesting</li>
