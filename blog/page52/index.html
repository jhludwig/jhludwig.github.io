				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">12 January 2010</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>* “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao”:amazon by Junot Diaz. Amazing story. Intertwines the tale of an outcast, a tragic family, the sad 20th century history of the Dominican Republic, and classic science fiction themes. Unique and surprisingly hopeful. Amazon gives 4-5 stars, this is definitely a 5 star read. * “Gentlemen of the Road”:amazon by Michael Chabon. Great tale of middle age adventurers. Jacket blurb says reminiscent of Leiber’s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories and this is dead on. Amazon says 3.5 stars but I thought this was fun, 4 stars at least. * “A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R”:amazon by Brian Everitt and Torsten Hothorn. I wanted an overview of R, this wasn’t it, but a useful set of case studies of the various types of problems that R can be used on. Very thinly reviewed on Amazon, I’d say 3 stars. * “The Perfect Fruit”:amazon by Chip Brantley. Moderately interesting story of the inside of the fruit growing industry. Personally would have enjoyed more of the science, and more color on the people in the industry. Amazon says 5 stars but not a ton of reviews. I’d say 3. * “The Red Prince: The Secret Lives of a Habsburg Archduke”:amazon by Timothy Snyder. The blurb on Amazon drew me, and I enjoy history. The author attempts to enliven this story with a lot of meandering and fictionalization, it just didn’t work for me. Perhaps Habsburg history is meandering and confusing, perhaps just this telling, I’ll never know as I am giving up. Amazon says 4.5 stars with a light review history, I’d say 2.5. It is not terrible but just didn’t grab me.</p>

				<p><p>“Skiff e-reader targeted at magazines and newspapers”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2010697015_ces_lg_sprint_launch_skiff_new.html – OK I love gadgets and will try darn near anything, but this is a headscratcher for me. I love my Kindle because a) it is way easier to travel with than 5 books, and b) the e-books are generally cheaper than print books, and as a heavy reader, this is hundreds of dollars a year. I get huge payback because of these facts.</p>

<p>What payback will I get from Skiff? It won’t be any easier to travel with than 5 magazines really – magazines don’t take much room, and I dispose of them as I go (to the degree that I read any magazines at all anymore). And magazines aren’t that expensive, there is no way I can save that much money.</p>

<p>I understand the publishers are casting about for a lifesaver but this seems like a waste.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>My MacBook is entering middle age and as my intensity of use has grown over the last 6 months (due to coursework at UW) I’m finding I need to start focusing on productivity a little. Some tools that seem helpful:</p>

<p>* “Popchar”:http://www.macility.com/products/popcharx/ provides much better special character insertion than the standard OSX tool. Helpful for entering math symbols, etc. I love this. The basic OSX system tool is weak. * “Keycue”:http://www.macility.com/products/keycue/ from the same guys, cheat sheet of keyboard shortcuts. Better than it sounds. I cannot remember all these keyboard shortcuts and this is way way way better than help/manual/online search. * “Hazel”:http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php for automagically managing files. My use case is dealing with downloads from various UW course sites and automagically handling. Keeps my downloads folder in order. Handy tho not absolutely mandatory. * “Path Finder”:http://www.cocoatech.com/ as a replacement for Finder. Definitely more handy for moving files between folders. * “Growl”:http://growl.info/ – not sure why I installed but all the cool kids seem to use.</p>

<p>Also on my new Windows 7 setup I am starting to play with some things:</p>

<p>* “Win7 multimonitor taskbars”:http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheNearFinalWordOnMultiMonitorTaskbarsForWindows7UltramonVsDisplayFusion.aspx?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ScottHanselman+%28Scott+Hanselman+-+ComputerZen.com%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader – haven’t tried these but probably should try one. * “Feedroller”:http://lifehacker.com/5352037/feedroller-puts-rss-and-twitter-updates-across-your-monitor?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+lifehacker%2Ffull+%28Lifehacker%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader – well I wanted to love this, and it looks great, but seems to have problems updating its content.</p>

<p>And across both machines:</p>

<p>* “Helvitical”:http://www.iamadtaylor.com/helvetical/ and its friends Helvetimail and Helvetireader certainly improve the looks of google apps. A little buggy tho.</p>

				<p><p>Holiday time, and time for some light escapist reading.</p>

<p>* “The Moor”:amazon by Laurie R. King. Part of her Russell series, and excellent. Interesting character, very atmospheric (the “Moor” refers to the moorlands of England). The mystery itself was nothing special but the character and atmosphere make up for it. * “Terra Incognita”:amazon by Ruth Downie. A mystery set in the Britain of Roman times. An interesting lead character, the doctor affiliated with the Roman legionnaires. The story is choppy and doesn’t hang together well, but the character has promise. * “Revelation Space”:amazon by Alistair Reynolds. Modern space opera. Great reviews but I found it unoriginal. * “The Fade”:amazon by Chris Wooding. Fantasy set in an underground world at war, very engaging. Grabs you from the first chapter.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">22 December 2009</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Time for our biennial system build exercise. We built two systems over the last two weeks. While I still use my MacBook Pro for 95% of my productivity work, the Mac game market is moribund, and there is some joy in building a machine from components. So for the fun of building, and for gaming use as well as other general use, we built out two different systems:</p>

<p>* Cases. Very different choices. Air cooling for both, we’ve had 3-4 liquid-cooled systems. Liquid cooling looks awesome with the right fluids and lights, but – another maintenance hassle; sometimes catastrophic failures; and they just aren’t any quieter really. ** First system is an <a href="http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=N82E16811129043">Antec 1200</a>. Classic full tower case, tons of drive bays, tons of fans, full complement of front panel ports. Nice clear sides, some cool interior lighting. Nice looking final system, but a little time consuming to pull together – particularly all the cable connections for fans and front panel connectors. But looks nice complete. ** Second system is built around a <a href="http://www.highspeedpc.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&amp;Category_Code=TopTechSTD">High Speed PC Tech Station</a>. An open, “caseless” system, super easy and quick to assemble, and gives nice open access to all elements of the system. The finished product looks messy but that is part of the appeal. No protection from the elements either. Massively faster to assemble tho. * Motherboards. The Antec has an <a href="http://usa.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=wurRaDZ8lo4Ckukj&amp;templete=2">ASUS P6X58D</a> and this is a great board – USB3, SATA3, designed for overclockers. Probably should have gotten this board for both systems. The second has an <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157150">ASRock X58</a> which is fine and a little cheaper but lacks the USB3 and SATA3 support. For the price-difference, probably should have goen with the more future-proof board. Both boards seem pretty equivalent otherwise. * Processors. Intel i7-920 2.66Ghz quad-core on both. Not the most expensive but overclockable. On the first PC with the Antec case, we installed a higher capacity cooler for overclocking support – a noname generic cooler but something like <a href="http://www.computersonics.com/_e/CPU_Fans/product/CPUFAN_OCZVANQUISHER/OCZ_Vanquisher_CPU_Heatsink_Fan.htm">this one</a> that we picked up at a the local parts store. * RAM. 6GB of Corsair Dominator Triple Channel ram (3x2GIG) on both systems. Pretty easy to install, tho absolutely no documentation on the fan, but there was really only one way to try to install it and it seemed to work. * Power supplies. The Antec has an <a href="http://www.ocztechnology.com/products/power_management/ocz_z_series_1000w">OCZ 1000W</a>. This is a solid supply with tons of connectors, certainly good enough for nearly any system. But the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817194046">Enermax Galaxy 1250W</a> is super nice because of the modular cable system – you only attach the power connectors you actually need. Cuts down massively on cable clutter, particularly helpful for the caseless system. I’d go with modular supplies every time in the future. * Hard drives. Both machines have 2 1.5TB WD Caviar drives, 7200 RPM. Nothing fancy, amazing how cheap drives have become. Considered faster drives but they contribute to noise and, based on past experience with 10K rpm drives, not clear they add that much performance. * DVD/Blue Ray drives. Not having strong opinions on drive vendors (partly because I’ve had bad drives from every vendor in the past), we scattered out purchases around here. Both systems have the same bluray drive – <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827136164">an LG drive</a>. One system then has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFWBIA/ref=oss_T15_product">Samsung DVD burner</a>, the other a Pioneer. * Removeable media. Both systems have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AI6CNK/ref=oss_T15_product">17-in-1 Sony memory card reader</a>. Neither has a floppy, thank goodness Windows install doesn’t need that anymore. * Video cards. OK we really wanted Radeon 5970s but these are mythical. The 5870s are near-mythical, almost like unicorns. But they are findable on ebay for near MSRP and that is the route we went. Expect to pay $500 or so. Standard ebay warnings apply – look for vendors with long selling histories, flawless reputations, US-based, etc. We had no problems. The caseless system also has a second card, a 5770, the goal is to be able to run directx games on one display while running other apps on the other card, I’m not convinced this is actually possible. * Software. Win7 ultimate, from MS Company Store for $50. Worth renewing my alumni membership for this. Installed easily, 64bit on both. Unlike vista, this version really seems to work and driver software seems plentiful. The experience isn’t flawless – IE hung when downloading the latest ATI drivers and we had to use opera/chrome/firefox; and the homegroup network UI is ill-considered at best, the networking UI is basically awful. Inventing funky abstractions like homegroups and libraries isn’t that helpful, lipstick on a pig. I just want to see the machines and devices on my network as a first step, is that so hard? * Other software. Opera, Chrome, Firefox, Acrobat, Steam (with COD4, L4D2), Zune, Office10Beta, FileZilla, Tunebite all installed fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Machines both running well and seem to be happy so far. What do we still want?</p>

<p>* SSD drives. Also near mythical, impossible to find. Will have to add these post holidays. * 5970 video cards. * A desktop power switch for the caseless system. With no case, there is no obvious power and reset button, just little switches on the motherboard. One idea is to switch to a PS2 keyboard and enable powerup from keyboard in the BIOS.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/the-bcs-needs-an-agenda">The BCS needs an agenda</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">17 December 2009</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK I don’t love the <a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org">BCS</a> but I am not a college football playoff nut either. College basketball is great in March but the rest of the season has been sapped of its vitality and that would be terrible for football.</p>

<p>The BCS has been made the bad guy in all these and they just sit back and let themselves get hammered, trying only the <a href="http://twitter.com/insidethebcs">most pathetic PR response</a>. Hiring a fancy PR firm, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/305270-bcs-at-it-again-bcs-plants-bombard-espns-playoff-piece">which the BCS has done</a>, isn’t going to help. No amount of spit and polish is going to make a crappy message look better.</p>

<p>The <strong>BCS needs to quit letting others set the agenda and needs to go on the offensive with their own agenda</strong>. Here is one proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the real problem with the matchups created this season in the BCS bowls? No one knows how to evaluate all the unbeatens – is an unbeaten TCU better or worse than Cincy or Texas or Boise or ? And are they really better than any 1-loss teams out there?</li>
  <li>We don’t know how to evaluate these teams because the regular season is a failure – there is little/no meaningful cross-conference play. Imagine if TCU had had to play a couple SEC teams or Cincy a couple Big-12 teams and so on. Meaningful interconference play during the season would help bowl seeding dramatically.</li>
  <li>The NCAA let schools add a 12th game to their seasons a few years back – and rather than adding meaning interconference play, everyone has gone on a cupcake search. These games have added nothing to the quality of the sport. These games could and should be replaced with something more meaningful.</li>
  <li>The idea then: grab the 12th game back. Ask all schools to hold a weekend in mid-October open. At the end of the previous weekend’s play, seed all the FCS teams into meaningful interconference games. And have a grand mid-season interconference weekend full of meaningful games.</li>
  <li>This would bring a level of excitement to the sport in October that would be unprecedented. A weekend of great games. The excitement of seeding announcements the weekend before. It would be an event on the scale of March Madness but unique to football in structure. It would be like a midseason Bowl season.</li>
  <li>We would hold off creating BCS ratings until after this weekend so that the ratings can benefit from the information learned in this weekend.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than sitting back passively and being blamed as the bad guy ruining the sport, the BCS could go on the offensive with a proposal that would materially improve the sport. And it would maintain the character and history of the bowls, while improving the postseason matchups.</p>

<p>There are many ways the mid-season seeding could happen and there is no need to get caught up in our undershorts of any one system. A proposal below but the exact form doesn’t matter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pick a weekend 6 weeks into the season – halfway point. All schools hold the weekend free for a game to be scheduled, and they agree to provide a playing facility every other year. Gate will be evenly split between schools, no one should care where a game is played. There is a debate to be had about games played on campus or at neutral sites, I have no strong position, there are good arguments for either.</li>
  <li>Scheduling is done completely blind of any rankings, human or computer. All that is considered is FBS conference rankings up to that point in the season.</li>
  <li>Conference standings are split in half – upper and lower. If you are in upper half, you will play an FBS team in the upper half of another FBS conference. Lower half, then opponent in lower half of another FBS conference. Seeding happens within these halves then.</li>
  <li>Unaffiliated teams are grouped with existing conferences for this exercise. ND with Big10, Navy and Army with BigEast, etc. A best estimate made of where they would rank in conference standing.</li>
  <li>The out-of-conference lineup rotates each year according to a known schedule.</li>
</ul>

<p>So applied to this year’s Big10 standings (approximate midyear , based on memory):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Iowa Plays a 6 seed from Pac10</li>
  <li>PSU plays a 5 seed from Mountain West</li>
  <li>OSU plays a 4 seed from WAC</li>
  <li>Wisconsin plays a 3 seed from Sun Belt</li>
  <li>MSU plays a 2 seed from Big12</li>
  <li>Notre Dame plays a 1 seed from CUSA</li>
  <li>Northwestern plays a 12 seed from MAC</li>
  <li>Minnesota plays an 11 seed from SEC</li>
  <li>Purdue plays a 10 seed from Big East</li>
  <li>Indiana plays a 9 seed from the ACC</li>
  <li>Illinois plays an 8 seed from the Pac10</li>
  <li>Michigan plays a 7 seed from the Mountain West</li>
</ul>

<p>The conferences were just listed arbitrarily west to east. The next year they would rotate so you get a mix of seeds from conferences every year.</p>

<p>This system doesn’t screw up conference standings, in fact in <strong>reinforces the conference games</strong> as conference standing impacts seeding. It <strong>doesn’t screw up bowl affiliations, bowl economics, bowl season</strong>. It <strong>doesn’t screw up BCS participation</strong> except for at-large teams, and it can only improve the quality of selection. It <strong>creates a huge amount of midyear excitement</strong>, almost a 2nd bowl season. And it is <strong>scalable</strong> -- if only 3 conferences want to participate at first, fine, do it with just 3.</p>

<p>OK so there are a ton of details to work out but the core is this – the <strong>BCS needs to create a positive agenda and get out of their reactive position, and there is plenty of opportunity to improve the regular season</strong>.</p>

				<!-- <p><p>OK I don’t love the <a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org">BCS</a> but I am not a college football playoff nut either. College basketball is great in March but the rest of the season has been sapped of its vitality and that would be terrible for football.</p>
