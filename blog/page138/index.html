				<p><p>OK I screwed up a little bit on my move to MT3.2. My archive naming scheme changed because I blew away my old blog. And I exported and reimported all my entries. As a result I was left with a lot of old archive entries, expecting my old CSS, but getting my new CSS so they looked like crap. I forced a rebuild of all the old pages but because of the entry export/import, all my entry numbers were different.</p>

<p>As a result, search engines are now pointing to pages that look ok but have the wrong content. Sorry. If you use the searchbox on this page here you will find the right content. Search engines will eventually catch up.</p>

				<p><p>Nice commentary on <a href="http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2005/Columnists/Fiu/COW/Cavalcade_of_Whimsy.htm">collegefootballnews.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Coaches can go from one team to another without having to sit out a year. Students can transfer from one college to another without any sort of a penalty. It’s time the repressive NCAA realizes how unfair it is to its employees, er, student-athletes and allow them to transfer as well if they choose to. If a player doesn’t like the school he’s at, he should be able to leave at any time without penalty. Go ahead, raid away. If a coach doesn’t like this idea, then he should make sure his school and program are good enough to keep the players. As far as the coaches of the “Katrina schools”, if you really care about your players, you’ll let them do what’s in their best interest, not yours. And to the NCAA, it is possible to make exceptions to the rules and use some actual judgment when it’s time to do the decent thing</em>.</p>

<p>The hypocrisy of the adults involved with college sports sickens me. Love the games, love the kids, but some of the adults, well…</p>

				<p><p>Dipped into the nonfiction pool recently:</p>

<p>* “Confessions of an Economic Hit Man”:amazon. OK I don’t doubt parts of the premise here – the developed nations of the western world use economics to influence and control happenings in the less developed countries. And when economics fail, they sometimes use other means. Duh. This is the way the world has worked approximately forever. I am not sure what he is blowing the whistle on. But Perkins is a blowhard. Puts himself in the middle of all the major happenings of the 20th century. Uses the word “I” all the time. Not much acknowledgement to any teams. It seems almost pathological, and the author drops hints about problems in his personal life, you get the sense he has a real pathology here. And he did this job he hates – extending the western world’s economic dominance over the rest of the world – for years and let himself be bought at every turn. Even when he showed signs of a conscience, he jumped back into the job with both arms, at one point claiming “if I didn’t do it, someone else would.” Wow now that is a standup guy. You get the sense he wrote this book now for fame or money or both, not out of some real sense of altruism.</p>

<p>* “The New Normal”:amazon. Here I thought this was a business book, given the author. But really it is a self help book (I haven’t dipped into this genre since <a href="http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=36&amp;ti=26,36&amp;Search_Arg=dyer%2C+wayne&amp;Search_Code=NAME_&amp;PID=7605&amp;CNT=25&amp;HC=39&amp;SEQ=20050919161222&amp;SID=2">Wayne Dyer burst on the market in the 70s</a>). A lot of economic observations but really this is all about taking control of your life. Roger articulates pretty well how technology is giving us even more control, and how your government/employer safety nets are decaying even more (largely out of their control). And how you can and should take the opportunity to grab control of your own life. Great stuff, young people should read this book or something like it. Hat tip to <a href="http://www.ackerley.com/about.htm">chris</a> for the book.</p>

				<p><p>First a non-Ignition blog, but one that ought to be in all our aggregators:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/l">Mini Microsoft</a>. A constant fountain of great stuff. Don’t just read the posts, dip into the comments too. Important to read not because of any MSFT obsession or any joy taken in MSFT gossip, but because we face Microsoft daily on the recruiting front and it is smart to know what people are talking about there.</p>

<p>Around ignition blogs, the jobster guys clearly are outposting everyone else:</p>

<p>* Jason with a <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/09/fantastic_katri.html">job for someone affected by Katrina</a>. The jobster guys have done a lot for Katrina victims, this is just one example. Here <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/jobster-katrina-initiatives/">Phil talks</a> about all the things they are doing. * Phil on the <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/jobster-tools-and-technologies/">Jobster technology stack</a>. I wonder how decisions at other companies differ. * Phil on <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/hiring-innovators/">hiring innovators</a> and <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/growing-a-culture-of-innovation-introduction/">nurturing innovation</a>. * Phil on <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/searching-for-blogs-related-to-a-topic/">finding relevant blogs</a>. He is right here – it is easy to find posts today but hard to find blogs on particular topics. * Rich on <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/travel/seattle/2005/09/03/seattle_ferries.html">tracking ferries via GPS</a>. Love the ferry system.</p>
