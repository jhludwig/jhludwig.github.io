Rich Tellshow has done some <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rtell/teams/conf.html">further analysis on strength of schedules</a> which is worth looking at – points to the Pac10 and Big10 as the strongest conferences so far this year.</p>

And they never saw a picture (firewall/nat problems?). I’ll try it with MSN Messenger next but not a great first 30 minutes.</p>

    <p>I’ve posted my current projections over at Fanblogs – <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/archives/000404.php" title="NCAA College Football - Fanblogs.com: Sept 30 BCS Projections">NCAA College Football - Fanblogs.com: Sept 30 BCS Projections</a>. Among the loser’s bracket (the single-loss teams), Georgia, USC, WSU, and Michigan are the leaders. I suspect that we will end up with two major unbeatens but if the unbeatens falter, look for these teams to sneak in. One of the crazy things about college football is – if you must lose, do it early in the season so that the memory fades.</p>

    <p>Spent the weekend in LA. A great place to visit but wow am I glad I live in the Northwest – the smog, lack of greenery, and congestion are so wearing.</p>

<p>Best things we did in LA: Dinner at <a href="http://losangeles.restaurantnotes.com/viewtopic.php?t=368" title="- MAKO in Beverly Hills is outstanding - The Best Los Angeles Restaurant Guides are your fellow diners!">Mako</a> – pan-asian cuisine served tapas-style. Great service and fun food. Lodged at the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/losangeles/">Four Seasons</a> – great service, and a veritable freak show of celebrities, celebrity-wanna-bes, celebrity entourages, and plastic surgery victims.</p>

<p>Worst things we did in LA: Rodeo Drive looks like a war zone, don’t bother going until they finish the street work (Christmas? next year?). <a href="http://www.farmersmarketla.com/">Farmer’s Market</a> – a lousy market with lousy restaurants. Come up to Pike Place Market in Seattle instead. <a href="http://www.miramax.com/duplex/">Duplex</a> -- not Ben Stiller’s best work. Funny at times but overall pretty weak.</p>

From Sunday’s LA Times coverage of the game: ?<em>When you get on a streak…you get to thinking it can never happen,</em>? Carroll said. ?<em>It can. You can get beat.?</em></p>

<p>Oregon fell prey to complacency as well this week. ?<em>We were still thinking about the Michigan game and I don’t think we were fired up</em>,? Oregon receiver Sammie Parker said. ?<em>Everyone is usually fired up in the locker room, but we were really quiet today. We were just kind of waltzing around and I don’t think we were ready to play</em>. ?</p>

<p>Now the Pac-10 is basically out of the national championship hunt. A lesson to all the other teams and conferences out there.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/09/22/bcs-rankings-4.html">BCS Rankings</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK is it too early to start talking about BCS Rankings? Considering they don’t come out until October 20th? Nah, never too early.</p>

<p>I did a quick and dirty analysis tonight. ESPN has a <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/2002-2003.html">page</a> that describes the basic calculations from last year, I started from this formula, I haven’t heard of changes to the formula this year. The <a href="http://www.cfrc.com/" title="Home">College Football Resource Center</a> and the <a href="http://www.mratings.com/cf/compare.htm">Massey Ratings</a> sites have a lot of the raw computer ranking data. The Wolfe poll will not be available until 10-20; I was not able to find the NY Times computer poll today on the net yet; and the Massey BCS variant seems to be behind a subscription wall so I used the published non-BCS Massey rating (which includes margin of victory, which is not permitted in BCS polls). Also on the Sagarin site, you need to be careful and get the BCS variant, not the standard Sagarin rating.</p>

<p>Also I didn’t go thru all the strength of schedule calculations as this requires building a little db of every Div1 team’s opponents and results, a little beyond my Excel hacking tonight. The lack of this doesn’t really sway the results as it is likely only going to add a further point of difference to the scores.</p>

<p>OK so today, Oklahoma (3 points) and Miami (3.67 points) would play in New Orleans. OSU (7 points) and USC (7.33) would be on the outside looking in, in a very nice Rose Bowl match I assume (tho maybe the Orange would get to poach one of these teams? Sad if so). FSU is the next closest unbeaten at 9.67 points, with the rest of the unbeatens at 12 points or more.</p>

<p>This will all scramble a lot but fun to start projecting.</p>
