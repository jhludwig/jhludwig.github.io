<p>it would be interesting to write up and discuss people’s best practices for identity protection. the other thing i am glad i do is to maintain basically two complete bank accounts. one is the “public” account, from which i write all checks, do automatic bill payment, etc. the other is a private account that is where my financial assets are really kept. they are at different institutions. i routinely move money over to the “public” account to pay bills. with this setup, if someone learns how to forge checks or compromises my atm card or something else, they have access to only a teeny tiny part of my assets and i can shut down that public account if i need to.</p>

I had to do a “reset” to finally get it to emit 5.1 sounds – hold down the tone button, the power button for 3 seconds, then enter and then setup. i can imagine why this unit got returned to best buy, it tries to be so smart about deciding what source and output mode to use, but i think it gets wedged into misconfigs.

				<p><p>I raised a dispute with <a href="http://www.americanexpress.com">American Express</a> concerning my problems with <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/10/an_alienware_sucks_roundup.html">Alienware</a> and I have to thank them, it is making things happen. I finally got a personal contact from alienware today:</p>

<p>_Dear Mr. Ludwig,</p>

<p>I tried to call you earlier today and left you a voicemail on the following regard. As I stated in the message, your system is ready to be shipped out, however earlier today Alienware received a chargeback dispute from your credit card company in the amount of $XXXX.XX. Unfortunately, we cannot ship the system out until this dispute is lifted. If you can please contact your credit card company and lift this dispute, it will be most helpful in expediting your order. Please feel free to contact me at anytime should you have any questions regarding this matter.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>XXXXXXXXXX XXXXX Critical Issues Agent Alienware Corporation</p>

<p>Phone: 305.XXX.XXXX Fax: 786.XXX.XXXX www.alienware.com_</p>

<p>Needless to say I will not be lifting the dispute. It is apparently the only lever I have – the system is just coincidentally ready to ship out the moment they receive the dispute notice. They can ship me the system and if it is perfect I will pay. I’d rather the money back.</p>

				<p><p>Continuing to plug away on my halloween surround sound setup – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/10/halloween_surround_sound_statu.html" title="A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: Halloween Surround Sound Status">A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: Halloween Surround Sound Status</a> One awesomely great feature of the <a href="http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/audioadv/roadie/producthome.asp">turtlebeach audioadvantage roadie</a> is the headphone jack. You can use it simultaneously with the spdif out – so many sound cards turn off the speaker out when a headphone is detected. here you can use both. the documented use is to attach another pair of speakers to create a 7.1 setup. But for halloween you can use this extra output to drive your lightning controller such as the <a href="http://www.i-zombie.com/">i-zombie</a>.</p>

<p>So my sound is working great. my lighting controllers are all firing. now i am playing around with lights – halogen worklights, par lights, some low voltage stuff – to create the best effect.</p>

<p>Oh and i am working on my other surround sound config which won’t be lightning, but will be ambient graveyard sounds.</p>

				<p><p>Tested my surround sound setup for our front yard this AM.</p>

<p>* For authoring using <a href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/Products/ShowProduct.asp?PID=1005">Sony acid pro</a>. Works great, no complaints. You can mix an arbitrary number of sound sources, each traversing the listening space on independent arbitrary paths. * Getting XP to play an ac3 file is impressively hard. Of course I can play it back on the machine with Acid Pro, but if I want to use another machine, it is tough. <a href="http://www.digital-digest.com/dvd/downloads/showsoftware_graphedit_141.html">Graphedit</a> is super helpful for examining codec chain to see if you can play the media. <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm">Klite mega codec pack</a> is good for getting codecs and tools. * Despite all this, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/10/default.aspx">wmp</a> only plays half the ac3s I give to it. The ones that do play – wmp gives me an error saying I am missing a codec. The ones that don’t play – just silently fail. Klite to the rescue again with wmp classic which seems to play them all. * Using <a href="http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/audioadv/roadie/producthome.asp">Turtle beach audioadvantage roadie</a> for 5.1 output. Seems to work fine. Nice control panel to test surround features. I didn’t have to pay anything like the $80 MSRP for this device. * Feeding the turtlebeach output via spdif to a generic av amp – bought the cheapest open-box unit i could find at bestbuy</p>

<p>Overall it sounds good. I have a much bigger listening area than typical for a home theatre install – and the impact seems to be that the center channel is a little too dominant. I’m going to experiment with moving the sound locus to further back in the listening field. And for my big lightning strikes, I may try 5 duplicate strikes, each positioned out at one of the speakers.</p>

<p>Oh and I am going to try some codec options to get WinAMP to play 5.1 via spdif.</p>
