But wow did I hear some salty language in the random games, comments that were just not appropriate.

I bought this phone a couple years ago because of the included mp3 player. i haven’t used it much in the last year but i dusted it off and started using again. I wanted to load new music on it of course. A, the old software doesn’t work under XP. B, Sprint doesn’t support the phone anymore and there is no XP software on their site. C, Samsung doesn’t support the phone anymore and there is no XP software on their site. So I now have a phone that has a set of music, for all intents and purposes, welded into the phone for all time. After being introduced just a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Reinforces my determination to NEVER buy a device again that doesn’t support simple open formats and protocols. Vendors don’t maintain their proprietary crap and then you are stuck.</p>

I had a similar experience recently. I had to get a copy of a video to someone. After capturing it from my camera, I went thru the trouble of trying to get it back on a DVD, worrying about +R/-R formats, hoping the DVD would work in their player, etc. And then had an aha moment and just jammed the video in 4-5 different encodings on my website. Worked great. Leave the DVD burning to someone who wants to screw around with DVD compat issues.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>Shared Browsing</strong>. I have been using the Application Sharing feature of MSN Messenger a lot recently. It is a great homework and college app tool, we can sit together and look at online apps, or at various homework searches. But there are some things I hate about it. A, it is such overkill. Tons of code loads and then the entire app window gets scraped, rendered into some protocol, and sent remotely, where a ton of code on the other machine receives and rerenders. B, it is so squirelly. All kinds of paint problems on the receiving end – Windows just doesn’t seem that happy with this crazy idea. C, the interface is absolutely unintelligible. I only understand it because, well, I used to manage the team. My kids think it is the goofiest software. I can’t even imagine explaining it to my dad.</p>

<p>I’d like a simpler, lighter-weight solution. The data I really need to pass between machines is just the URL, cookie data, and some SSL data i think. Looking for solutions on the web – <a href="http://www.ezwebcar.com/Faq.asp#Co-Browsing">ezWebCar</a> -- hmm doesn’t handle ssl, maybe for good reasons. But makes it useless for college apps. <a href="http://www.talisma.com/products/browsing.asp">Talisma</a> has a product which handles SSL but seems enterprise focused. There are other enterprise focused solutions floating around too like Wicom. Then there are classroom focused solutions like <a href="http://www.webwisdom.com/Products/vclassroom.html">webwisdom</a>. But way heavier than I need.</p>

<p>Maybe I should go lower-tech and just use a combo of <a href="http://www.42u.com/video_splitters.htm">KVM boxes and splitters</a> to share the screen. Probably would be more robust than all the software solutions.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Multiple PCs in the Home</strong>. Something I am starting to wonder about lately – I originally thought that the emergence of multi-PC homes would be a huge boon for Microsoft. And in the short term it is. But long term I wonder. The more PCs I have in my home, the more driven I am to get data off the PCs and get it centralized on servers. With a clean self-descriptive data format so that the data is usable from any PC. And get devices off individual PCs and get them on the net so they are usable from anywhere. And move to very lightweight apps that are easy to deploy and manage on all the PCs. And move to cheap apps since I can’t afford Office licenses for all my machines. In the long run, it seems like this will all play more to appliance vendors, to other device providers, and to alternative app providers, more than it will play to Microsoft.</p>
