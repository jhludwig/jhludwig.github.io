				<p><p><strong>BCS forecast</strong>. Not sure why Brad picks Miami to leapfrog OSU in the standings – <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2002/1117/1462226.html">ESPN.com: NCF - Inside The BCS</a> – doesn’t make sense to me. OSU can only build on its lead from last week as OSU won while Miami was idle. Sure OSU looked weak but victory margin does not matter to the computers. OSU’s schedule strength can only go up it seems to me…hmm, <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/2002/11/17/bcs_preview/">cnnsi</a> is echoing the ESPN line, projecting OSU’s lead to slip. Maybe I need to go review the BCS math. Can beating a weak team actually hurt a contender more than being idle?</p>

<p>OK I’ve started to dig into the computer components. Of the 4 that have published today, 3 did not change from last week, but 1 – the NY Times poll – did drop OSU to 2 and move Miami to 1. Given that the computers are not permitted to consider margin of victory, this seems like a pretty bad flaw in the NY Times algorithm to me. I just don’t get how playing and winning can be considered more negative than being idle.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>Buckeyes 23, Illini 16</strong>. Wow, what a stressful game. After beating Purdue on a 4th quarter hail mary last week, I expected the Buckeyes to come out this week charged up to show the world what they were really made of.</p>

<p>Instead, they went for degree of difficulty points. “It’s not enough to win at the last minute in the 4th quarter. Let’s drag this thing into overtime and see if we can still win.”.</p>

<p>But a win is a win. 12-0 is a pretty rare place to be, regardless of how we got there. Early in the season the buckeyes seemed to wear teams down. Their superior size and athleticism and depth would wear teams out midway thru the 3rd. That isn’t happening anymore. I wonder if the long season is taking a toll.</p>

<p>Bring on the wolverines!</p>

				<p><p><strong>BCS Forecast</strong>. Well here’s my guess on tomorrow’s BCS poll. OSU and Miami will easily stay 1-2 – no one else is in striking distance, OSU will pick up points despite their weak showing because a) margin of victory doesn’t count, and b) their strength of schedule will improve due to an additional game and Texas Tech’s defeat of Texas (remember, OSU beat Texas Tech the first game of the season).</p>

<p>The question is #3. WSU should easily hold its #3 position. The Texas loss will hurt Oklahoma in the standings as they will lose their -.6 quality win points. And no one else is even close to WSU. Iowa could move up a little but I don’t think much, they didn’t move up an extraordinary amount in the voted polls this am.</p>
