My gut tells me that this kind of service is going to get rolled into every settop box, dvd player, game console, just like DVR capability is getting rolled in. The need for a separate box is not apparent to me. I think this dynamic is going to kill off DVD players and their hidef ilk as well.</p>

    <p>The Kindle has clearly helped me push my reading pace up. Particularly for classics which are cheap. I am at the point now where I look first for Kindle versions, and only occasionally buy non-Kindle books.</p>

<p>* “The Scarlet Pimpernel”:amazon. A rousing tale of adventure and deception and love. Great for all ages, wish I’d discovered when I was young. OK there are some misogynistic and racial threads in here that are clearly dated but still a good tale. * “Siddhartha”:amazon by Hesse. Something about Hesse’s voice really appeals to me. Perhaps it is just the eastern philosophy. Perhaps I needed some peace in the aftermath of the BCS championship game. But still this is a simple but deep book. Contrast this with most of the bestselling selfhelp and business dreck out there. * “The Importance of Being Earnest”:amazon by Oscar Wilde. Sure I’ve seen productions of, but this is still a very readable play. 10x better than most of the romantic comedy cruft that we see on film. * “Person of Interest”:amazon by Theresa Schwegel. Good story about an undercover cop and how his secrecy has pervaded and corroded his entire family. Eventually there is redemption but not without a lot of pain on the way. The first third drug on a little but helped to establish the mood of the latter parts of the book.</p>

Me, well, I’m not so sure. Some serious offensive learning and development needs to take place. All the stupid penalty stuff can get fixed easily, and the effort was there.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="http://blog.dispatch.com/buckeyesblog/2008/01/year_in_reviewin_five_sentence.shtml">Columbus Dispatch dudes</a>, I am starting to wonder if the current system is really good for OSU. The 50 day layoff seems to have been better used by LSU and Florida. I am starting to lean towards a gasp playoff, and a Big-10 schedule delayed a week (already happening), to get rid of the layoff and compress prep time for teams.</p>

    <p>Sigh. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger I guess. Will be interesting to see how Tressel dissects this one. LSU is a very good team and OSU would have needed to play at their best, which they did not.</p>

<p>* The undisciplined play by the team certainly was huge. The roughing the punter was a poor decision, and the other fouls were just stupid. * The coaching staff refused to put the game in Beanie’s hands. * And tried to put the game in Boeckman’s hands, which he was clearly not ready for. Yes he made some bad decisions but why was he in a position to even make these decisions? He should have been watching Beanie run the ball.</p>

<p>Oh well. It is a game. You learn more from failure than from success. The Buckeyes are piling up the learnings!</p>
