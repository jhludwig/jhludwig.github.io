How good how fast, and will they learn to win the games they ought to win? * UW. My adoptive hometown team, will a new coach get them off the mat? * Florida. Hoping the rest of the SEC mans up and pins a couple losses on them. * Denison. Go Red Raiders! Only because a member of extended family is on the team.</p>

				<p><p>Some more serious non-fiction – two good, one drivel:</p>

<p>* “The Post-American World”:amazon by Fareed Zakaria. A little dated by financial events of the last year and, like all nonfiction books, really ought to be a pamphlet. But still some great core points about the US and it’s place in the world. The future is not to be feared because of waning US influence, but to be embraced because of the growth and development of so many other parts of the world. Amazon says 4 stars, I ding it a little bit for length but still a good book. * “The Only Three Questions That Count”:amazon by Ken Fisher. One successful investor’s view on how to invest. Insightful and worth a read, the discussion on national debt levels alone is worth the book. Successful investing is clearly not something done as a hobby, it takes a serious amount of discipline and analysis to follow his guide – not surprising. Oh the book is way too long though, where was the editor? Amazon says 4.5 stars, I would agree that there is great content in here. * “The Singularity Is Near”:amazon by Ray Kurzweil. I found this to be nearly unreadable. First the early nonsense about the knees of exponential functions (a bogus notion), then the unending blather about order and information (where was the editor?), and I just gave up. Maybe there are genius ideas in here but I suspect the author vastly underestimates the complexity and sophistication of our evolved biological structures. Feels like Wolfram’s “A New Kind Of Science” – the author is all fired up about his “insights” but didn’t bother to get any critical review. Amazon says 4 stars, I give this a 1.</p>

			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Is this the year of speech recognition? GigaOM thinks speech recognition is getting ready to take off – <a href="http://pro.gigaom.com/2009/08/is-speech-recognition-technology-finally-ready-for-prime-time/">Is Speech-Recognition Technology Finally Ready for Prime Time?</a></p>

<p>IN 2006 AnandTech had similar headlines – <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/multimedia/showdoc.aspx?i=2744&amp;p=1">Speech Recognition – Ready for Prime-Time?</a></p>

<p>CNN called it in 2001 – <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/06/06/auto.speech.idg/">Speech Recognition Technology will hear you now</a> – “After years of hype and false starts, automated speech recognition (ASR) technology is ready for prime time”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/Editorial/Feature/CALL-CENTERS-%3CBR%3E-The-Business-Case-for-Speech-in-the-Call-Center-29594.aspx">SpeechTechMag made the claim in 1999</a> – Speech recognition technology is “ready for prime time”</p>

<p>Apparently Comdex buzz in 1998 was that <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/0,1000000091,2069961,00.htm">1999 would be the year of speech recognition</a>. Again.</p>

<p>At one point in the mid/late 90’s, the Microsoft Speech Recognition team worked for me thanks to a reorg. All great people, very enthusiastic speech supporters, and convinced that widespread speech recognition was right around the corner. I loved the team but it seemed apparent that the hardware and software were both generations away from achieving useful speech recognition and so ultimately I worked to get the team moved to Microsoft Research.</p>

<p>So call me a skeptic. Over the past 15 years, you would have done well to always bet on “No” as the answer to “Is this the year of speech recognition?” I don’t see a lot of reason to change the bet. Speech is tough, we are demanding, we expect a system to respond to conversational input – rapid, lots of colloquialisms, speaker-independent, etc. Yes there are systems that can respond reasonably well to very limited inputs but as a general use technology, I’m not yet optimistic.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">02 August 2009</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>This post is going to save someone’s as$. The information is invaluable.</p>

<p>We have a SeaRay 280 Bowrider, 1996, but I am sure the info applies to newer models. Someone (not me, I know better!) unwisely left the batteries on when they left the boat. Which of course is always a mistake on a boat. Batteries are dead.</p>

<p>And what compounds the problem is that the batteries are underneath the hydraulically lifted engine cover. Which needs battery power to open. And which weighs a ton and is linked to hydraulic lifters which effectively prevent you from just lifting it by hand. Oh crap. (This is a strange boat – large for a bowrider, small for inboard/outboard engines, any bigger and it would have a shore power connection which would solve my problem, but this boat does not).</p>

<p>The SeaRay owner’s manuals are useless (though you can download them all <a href="http://www.searay.com/Page.aspx/pageId/10552/Manuals.aspx">here</a> to your heart’s content). Clearly they don’t expect boat owners to actually ever look at the engine. So I called <a href="http://www.lakeunionsearay.com/">Lake Union Searay</a> Redmond branch – nice people, very helpful. Apparently there is some way to reach through the oil check hatch and remove pins from the hydraulic lifts to allow you to muscle the hatch cover up – but it would require an intimate knowledge of the engine compartment since you are basically reaching around blind, the hatch is just large enough for your arm and no more.</p>

<p>Here is the key trick though. If you cobble together a 12V source (battery, charger, whatever) with a cigarette lighter adapter, and plug it into the cigarette lighter 12v port at the helm (which is normally used to provide power to 12v devices), the electricity will flow back into the boat and allow you to use boat electrics – hatch cover, etc. Completely undocumented and SeaRay won’t give you the parts to do it, but the service guys admit it will work.</p>

<p>So I got a $21 small riding mower battery. Went to Fry’s and got lighter adapter hardware. Wired them together, plugged it into the cigarette lighter, and pop the breaker went in the boat. Disconnected, switched polarity, reset the breaker, and tried again. Voila!!!! Hatch cover openers worked, I can now get at the batteries and either recharge or replace as needed.</p>

<p>Additional warnings and tips:</p>

<p>* the cigarette lighter adapter from Fry’s had 16-20 gauge wire, not sure what. Whatever it was, it is not enough for longterm use – the wire got hot to the touch. So get the job done and get it out of there. * Before I went to Fry’s, I tried used an old cell phone car adapter I had lying around. I cut the phone connector off, stripped the wires. This was clearly never going to work for two reasons. One, the wires were incredibly small, I am guessing 26 gauge. They would never have been able to carry the power. Two, the lighter head of the adapter is full of rectifying/transforming electronics, stepping down the car 12v voltage/high amperage to something the phone can use. Clearly I would not be able to stuff 12V/moderate amp signals back through this.</p>

<p>Good luck, hope this helps someone.</p>

Not a lot of community around my teams yet but will be fun to watch * <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/readwritestart/2009/07/cardly-lightweight-personal-mi.php">Card.ly</a>. Microsites. If 140 chars is good enough for a message, why should a website need much more? I guess. Ultimately I don’t know what I’d use this for. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/07/tunewiki-is-amazing/">TuneWiki</a>. Rich loves it, I am not sure I get it yet. * <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/06/solving-linear-programming-problems.html">Linear Programming using Google Spreadsheets</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/072709aaa.html">OSU picked to finish first</a> at Media Day.</p>

<p>Here are my hopes for the season: * OSU of course defeats SC and goes on to win the Big10 * Michigan takes steps towards respectability. You can’t have the best rivalry in sports if one of the programs sucks. * Someone rises in the west to challenge USC. * UW gets up off the mat and makes some progress. * Florida and Tebow take a dive. I am so sick of the Tebow-gasm in the press every day. My 2nd favorite team every weekend will be whoever is playing Florida.</p>

				<p><p>* “Long Lost”:amazon by Harlan Coben. Coben takes his Bolitar character into dark and personal territory. As always a fun adventure. Bolitar in Paris is great. Amazon says 3.5 stars, I’d up it to 4. * “Gone Tomorrow”:amazon by Lee Child. Another fine Reacher tale. Tho I start to feel that Reacher needs some depth – the Bolitar character in the Coben is more interesting because of his personal relationships. Reacher could benefit from some commitment – personal or professional. Amazon says 4 stars but I’d drop to 3.5. * “House of Suns”:amazon by Alastair Reynolds. In a far distant future, the galaxy filled by humanity and it’s offspring, a galaxy-threatening crisis. A fairly typical form, some interesting elements, but ultimately somewhat forgettable. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I’d say 3.5. Maybe 3.75. * “Judas Horse”:amazon by April Smith. A nicely layered tale of an FBI agent deep undercover. No one is quite who they seem, no one is a pure hero or villian. The agent’s struggles to maintain her own identity are nicely handled. Amazon says 4.5 stars, this is clearly the star of this crop of books.</p>
