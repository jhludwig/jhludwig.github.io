    <p>From <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/05/how_to_think_di.html">JK On The Run</a>, hints <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2005/05/18.html#a1150">on how to think differently</a>. I like <em>“Learning Something Outside Your Comfort Zone: If you’re an artist, learn about String Theory. If you’re a scientist, learn about the aesthetics of music.

    <p>* “The Rings of Saturn”:amazon. Difficult to get in the mood of this one. A solitary travel through modern england – dry, depressing tourism. There are no characters in the book besides the author, despite his wandering about present day England. I couldn’t finish – I guess it reinforces that life is all about the people you live it with, not about the places or things. * “Starfish by Peter Watts”:amazon. Wow a seriously good story. Characters have real meat, deeply damaged (by life? by design? an unresolved mystery) but deeply human. Layers of story here, it really draws you in. * “Freakonomics”:amazon. A solid nonfiction read. Entertaining, crisp, not bloated. The right length. The kind of economist I’d love to be, if I could. And a nice <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog.php">blog</a> * “The Magic Mountain”:amazon. I am really struggling with this one. The characters are boring but subtly compelling. But boy a whole lot of nothing happens in the story. I may need to save this book for a quieter location and time.</p>

<p>Oh and <a href="http://listsofbests.com/news/#000057">another award winner list – the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award</a>. Some of these look interesting.</p>

    <p>Based on <a href="http://www.zagula.com/food_and_wine/2005/05/19/seven_stars_pepper.html">john’s reco</a>, we found our way to seven stars pepper. A little hard to find but it was tasty – the Chong Gin chicken john reco’ed was excellent. But at the end of the meal we all agreed – chinese food is just not our favorite asian cuisine, we far prefer the flavors and spices of thai food.</p>

<p>Also we ate at <a href="http://www.serafinaseattle.com/">serafina</a> for lunch one day. Great great italian, we consistently like the Melanzane alla Serafina (eggplant rolls). Parking can be painful at busy times.</p>

    <p>So sometimes I just don’t have time to get to a trailhead, like this AM. In the past I would have just blown off exercising in the face of a tiny hurdle like this.</p>

<p>But this morning I parked the store at the grocery in factoria (my true destination) and hoofed it up the office and apartment-encrusted hills above factoria. Not very picturesque but it got my blood flowing. And the crisp windy air felt great. Glad I did it.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/05/20/todays-hike-520.html">Today&#039;s Hike -- 5/20</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Back to Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park (for the second time this week) for Today’s hike. BTW, online maps for the park can be found at the <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/gis/vmc/Recreation.htm">King County GIS Center</a>. Earlier this week we parked at the Anti-Aircraft Peak Trailhead, the Shangri-La trail from that point is a quite pretty tree-lined over-grown roadway, culminating in some huge lightly-treed bowls full of ferns and other ground cover – gorgeous. The trail leads steadily down so you’ll have a bit of a walk back to the trailhead.</p>

<p>This morning started at the Wilderness Creek Trailhead on the SE side of the park. A relative low point, the trail from here is a great cardio workout, steadily up with a lot of switchbacks. I ran out of time and didn’t quite make it to the top of Wildnerness Peak, you should be able to get from trailhead to top in an hour or hour and 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Next up: I think I’ll try the neighboring Squak Mountain trails.</p>

    <p>Boy Google has become pretty polluted on the topic of home networking, many of the top pages are thin bags of links, clearly just thrown together to generate google hits and revenue. Here’s my own list of home networking resources that I use.</p>

<p>* Blogs: ** <a href="http://www.practicallynetworked.com/">practically networked</a> – general home network coverage ** <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/">pvrblog</a> – PVRs ** <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/">ehomeupgrade</a> – all kinds of digital home and gagdet goodness</p>

We keep all our music on a server, I wish itunes would push tags and playlists back to the server. ** <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/mobility/getstarted/remoteintro.mspx">Remote Desktop</a> – I use this all the time to manage different machines from the family room – requires XP Pro. I tried a bunch of freeware alternatives but none of them seemed particularly robust at the time. ** <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a> – my backup strategy is to spread copies of photos and music around to 4-5 different places.</p>

<p>* Other websites: ** <a href="http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/category04">Annoyances.org</a> – some handy troubleshooting guides ** <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/">avsforum</a> – for av/hometheater stuff ** <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/">dslreports</a> – nice speed test for your broadband link among other tools ** <a href="http://bbhcentral.com/report/backissues/Report0503_1.html">Sandy and Dave’s</a> – a nice newsletter summing up industry events</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/05/13/getting-serious-about-exercise.html">Getting serious about exercise</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I had my annual physical this week (man I am glad we signed up for <a href="http://www.md2.com/md2.html">MD Squared</a>) and while I am generally healthy, I weigh 3 pounds more than last year. Maybe not a big deal, but I already weigh too much, and if I extrapolate 3 pounds a year – well this is what’s going to kill me.</p>

<p>A big reason for this is that I basically don’t exercise as I find it boring (I guess an early death will be even more boring!). So I need to remedy this. And I need a goal that I care about.</p>

<p>So I’m dusting off a <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000602.html">goal that I set four years ago</a> and have made no progress towards – backpacking significant portions of the pacific crest trail. I need to get in good enough shape to carry a 60-70 pound pack for 5-6 hours a day, for 10-15 days, through up and down terrain, and still have the energy to cook, set up camp, etc.</p>

<p>Step one – get comfortable hiking extended periods of time through tough terrain. I got new boots at rei – some <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/47570069.htm?">zamberlans</a> -- and went on a 2 hour hike this morning to start to break in the boots and get my feet toughened up – <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/parks/rentals/pommar99.htm">Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park</a> is close to home, has 36 miles of trails with a mix of inclines, and has a Nike missile site! Found my first blister-prone spot.</p>

<p>I’m going to keep this up. I’ll spend the rest of this summer getting into a regimen that I can sustain – the most important short term goal is accomodate excercise in a sustainable way into my schedule, if I am not still on a program in 3 months I am in trouble.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/05/11/power-in-the-home.html">Power in the home</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Martin has been an enthusiastic blogger about alternative energy <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/going_biodiesel.html">-- his biodiesel commuter car</a>, a <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/iogen_close_to.html">new cellulose ethanol plant</a>, <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/new_biodiesel_p.html">new biodiesel pumps in seattle</a>. I admire his putting his investment and consumer dollars on the line.</p>

<p>It’s made me intrigued about power. I’ve started at <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/recs/recs2001/publicuse2001.html">the DOE site on power use by consumers</a>. I learned that, as of 2001:</p>

<p>* We’re using about 95 Million BTU per household per year. About 4 3/4s short tons of coal for each of our homes if I did the math right. * Most of our use in the home is for heating (our surroundings and our water) and cooling. * The big story from 1993 to 2001 is declining power usage for heating, offset in part by greater cooling usage. I assume our heating systems are getting more efficient though there could be other reasons. * Appliances and lighting are about a quarter of our use.</p>

<p>I am very curious about the next 10 years of use:</p>

<p>* What will hybrid cars do to our consumption in the home? * How will the entry of low power lighting into the home (compact fluorescent, LED) affect usage? * How will the explosion of digital technology in the home affect our level of use – and our demand for uninterruptible power? * How will all this affect our HVAC needs? * What about home power generation? Good article in Wired about <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/1,2167,67465,00.html">home power generation</a>. and look at this <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000507043014/">cool sharp system</a> for managing your home power generation and grid connection</p>

<p>As a bleeding edge user, I am starting to see strains on the power (and HVAC) systems in my home:</p>

<p>* A sea of wallwarts generating DC power and heat in various places in the house. * Significant heat disposal issues in my office and at media centers. I’ve had to do crazy special things to deal with these problems – a special air conditioner for the office, a venting system and fan for the media center. The existing HVAC system, designed for whole house human comfort, is not designed to deal with waste heat from appliances. * Low end battery backups in a couple places in the home to insure continued operation of phones, pcs, etc.</p>

<p>No conclusions here today, just wondering. I’d love to talk to some home builders and understand what they view as state of the art hvac/power systems in the home.</p>

    <p>In the last couple weeks I’ve been to Lopez, Vashon, and I’m heading to Port Angeles this weekend, with more trips to Lopez in the offing.</p>

<p>There are instructions up at <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/">the WSDOT site</a> about how to get a ferry schedule on your PDA – sign up for avantgo, download avantgo client, configure a custom channel, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>At least for a fairly recent blackberry, this is all unnecessary. Just point your blackberry browser at the <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/pda/">pda schedule link</a> and you will be set.</p>

<p>Of course if you are on Shaw Island or someplace remote with no GPRS or whatever access, well, sorry.</p>

<p>And if you are new to the area – well there is nothing better than a ferry ride on a nice day.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/05/01/what-i-want-from-longhorn.html">What I Want From Longhorn</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>So last week seemed like a yawner for the windows business. Msft’s quarterly results showed a mature business. People at winhec were bored with longhorn – at best.</p>

<p>It got me to thinking about what I really want in the next version of windows. A lot of the discussion around longhorn concerns what I would classify as middleware – tagging, searching, graphical layout, media, etc. I can get a lot of this today without buying a whole new OS – and in fact would prefer to get this unbundled from my OS, and would prefer to get my OS unbundled from middleware.</p>

<p>What I really want an OS to do is get the most out of my hardware, and more to the point, make my hardware work. Here are some things I want</p>

<p>* Smart hard disk failure prediction. All the hard disks are instrumented, most of the utilities suck, but Microsoft should have the data to do a great job of failure prediction, especially if they pool real experience across all Windows users. * Video card stability. I play games, I have to download unapproved video drivers all the time, I wish the latest cards had better driver support. * Correctly working Usb attached drives. So often my XP machine decides it can’t find the drives. Why? I have no idea. But it happens on all my machines and I’ve heard it from other people too. * Bios patching. I’ll leave it for another day why we still have to deal with BIOSes at all, but given we do – why can’t windows find and apply all the patches for me? * Overclocking support. Give me a nice UI to deal with processor, ram, videocard clocking, and save me from doing wrong things. * Real working hibernation and suspend. I don’t use these features ever because so many devices don’t respond correctly to these state changes. * Sata support. It is terrible that using a sata drive requires me to insert a floppy at windows install time – who the heck has floppy drives any more??? * Software raid – please let me bond together heterogeneous drives, stripe across them, replicate across them, etc. * Power usage monitoring and budgeting. As my buddy rich tong has pointed out, a ton of system failures are due to insufficient power supplies. * Wireless USB. Please support asap! * Better printer and camera drivers. I hate all the shovelware that the printer and camera guys provide. Just please include the simplest possible drivers to print pages and to suck files off the camera. Phone drivers too so I can sync with ANY phone, not just msft’s smartphones – and don’t tell me to use ActiveSync, that thing is a confusing and confused piece of software. * Multicore support. Do something interesting with this. Don’t let the additional core just get sucked into the miasma of windows startup tasks, etc.</p>

<p>My point is – the OS should make my hardware work great and work flawlessly, that should be the point of an OS release. I don’t want delivery of these features slowed down by middleware integration, and I don’t want middleware delivery slowed down by inclusion of all these hardware features.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/04/29/litefeeds-retry.html">litefeeds retry</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I previously posted that I tried <a href="http://www.litefeeds.com">litefeeds</a> and it didn’t work. <a href="http://www.litefeeds.com/blojsom/blog/john/">One of their developers</a> read my blog and contacted me for details, and so I retried.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that litefeeds now works fine, and there was never really a problem except for a rookie mistake by me.</p>

<p>I read my subs using <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">newsgator</a>, and I regularly export the OPML file from newsgator to <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com">blogrolling.com</a> for my blog’s sidebar. Blogrolling.com will export my blogroll in opml as well, and I grabbed that for importation into litefeeds, blithely thinking “hey all opml files are the same”. WRONG. The newsgator exported file contains RSS feed urls. When imported into blogrolling, blogrolling determines the base blog url and just saves that. And so the exported opml file from blogrolling is not rss feed urls, but blog urls.</p>

<p>So litefeeds works fine now. And now that I can play with it I have some more constructive comments. It does install nicely and has a small memory footprint. But it is too hard to see content. First, when I have a feed or item listed, the space bar or return key should perform the default action – open the feed and show me the posts, open the post and show me the content.</p>

<p>Second, I don’t want just the entry excerpt provided by the feed, I want to push thru and read the whole post – litefeeds should integrate with the blackberry browser and let me read the posts.</p>

<p>So…happy to report that litefeeds works, and appreciate the support from the team. Hoping that they will add some more features so that it is even easier to read content.</p>
