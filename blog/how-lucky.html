	<title>Recent Books -- How Lucky, City of Orange, Dream and the Tomb, Falling, Addie LaRue – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="
  How Lucky by Will Leitch.  A moderately entertaining detective tale with a twist, the main character is beset by a crippling disease (spinal muscular atrophy) and is fighting to make something of their own life.  An easy read.
  City of Orange by David Yoon.  Seemed like the kind of post-apocalyptic tale I would like, but could never connect with the character or the situation.  The last(?) man alive fighting for existence on a deserted earth.  I gave up before I could find out what happened.
  The Dream and The Tomb by Robert Payne.  A history of the Crusades, largely from the European side.  What a morass of ego and ill-planning and wishful thinking.  Good lessons for any nation considering an overseas misadventure.
  Falling by T.J. Newman.  Formulaic and unexciting from the start.  Gave up fast.  Inspired me to remove a bunch of other crappy books from my library, so that is good.
  The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V.E. Schwab.  A young woman makes a deal with the devil and then spends centuries fighting against the deal.  Started out slowly but built nicely and couldn’t put it down by the end.
