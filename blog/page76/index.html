				<p><p>* “Watchmen”:amazon by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Wow, excellent. Better as a graphic novel than it could have been as a book, the use of text and font and images to intertwine multiple stories works very well. You have to think as you read. * “Where Are The Customer’s Yachts?”:amazon by Fred Schwed Jr. Timeless classic, its crtiticism of the financial services industry and customers’ foolishness is still dead on. * “Broken Angels”:amazon By Richard K Morgan. Another Kovacs novel, this one wasn’t a home run for me. With all the morally ambiguous factions, I could never quite get Kovacs’ motivations. And his drawn out death postponed by one miracle drug after another quit working for me. The whole thing felt a little choppy and unmotivated. * “Biomechanics of the Gastrointestinal Tract”:amazon by Hans Gregersen. Interesting reference on the GI tract, treating it as a mechanical device and analyzing behaviour from that view. Useful to help you build up a complete picture.</p>

<p>* August 28 North Carolina State vs. South Carolina. I don’t think NC State is there yet * August 29 Temple vs. Army. ugh. Army i guess * August 30 Utah vs. Michigan. I think Michigan will have a lot of emotion and will win this * Syracuse vs. Northwestern. Northwestern. Never take Syracuse * Virginia Tech vs. East Carolina. VT * Michigan State vs. California. Hmm, MSU is the favorite darkhorse in the big10 this year. But hard to win on the west coast. * Hawaii vs. Florida. Florida * Alabama vs. Clemson. Oh damn, Clemson is a trendy pick, but I have never won picking Clemson * Missouri at Illinois. Mizzou. Illinois strugges to repeat last year’s breakthru * Washington vs. Oregon. Hmm, Oregon is confused at QB, UW is not. * August 31 Kentucky vs. Louisville. Ugh, no respect for these teams. Probably take Louisville * Sept 1 Fresno State vs. Rutgers. Take Rutgers at home * Tennessee vs. UCLA. UCLA not ready for primetime yet</p>

And the fact that it is only in the Windows version and not in the Mac version has driven me batty, and has pissed me off so much, that I have finally converted all my XLs into Google Docs spreadsheets and dumped them into the cloud. Yes I lost some cool features. But I never have to install office software again, I don’t need to worry if the latest version is installed on the machine that I happen to be using today, I don’t have to worry about the fact that the last version of that spreadsheet is in my home office machine and not here at work, etc. I am immediately happier.

				<p><p>A guy walks into a bar in Ann Arbor wearing a Michigan jersey. And carrying a cat that also has a Michigan jersey on with a little Wolverine helmet on his head, too.</p>

<p>The guy says to the bartender, “Can my cat and I watch the Michigan game here? My TV at home broke down and my cat and I always watch the game together”.</p>

<p>The bartender replies, “Normally, cats wouldn’t be allowed in the bar, but it’s not very busy in here right now, so you and the cat can have a seat at the end of the bar. But, if there’s any trouble with you or the cat, I’ll have to ask you to leave.”</p>

<p>The guy agrees, and he and his cat start watching the game. Pretty soon Michigan manages to kick a field goal and the excited cat jumps up on the bar, walks all the way down and gives everyone a high five.</p>

<p>The bartender says, “Hey, that’s pretty cool! What does he do for a touchdown?”</p>

<p>The guy answers, “I don’t know, I’ve only had him for 2 years.”</p>

				<p><p>* “An American Tragedy”:amazon by Theodore Dreiser. A compelling story of overreaching ambition, lust, and tragedy. But oh my gosh could it have used an editor – needs to be about 40% shorter. The whole first book establishing the lustful ambition of the protagonist should have been a chapter. * “Beginner’s Greek”:amazon by James Collins. Entertaining comic romance. Light and breezy, appealing leads. * “Big Russ and Me”:amazon by Tim Russert. A light autobiography, particularly poignant in light of Russert’s untimely passing. No deep messages but solid life lessons and makes you sorry that Russert is gone.</p>
