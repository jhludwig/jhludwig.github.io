My cooling problem though is a little different – with 6 computers in 2 small rooms, plus printers, monitors, scanners, speakers, etc etc etc – my problem is room temperature, not pc temperature. No amount of liquid metal cooling is going to make my room cooler. I have installed a small Carrier single-room air conditioner to deal with the issue – so I guess that puts me at the bleeding edge of homes, not many have dedicated AC for computer rooms. So I salvage a little geek pride. * I’d love to explore <a href="http://www.cubix.com/ls/LSD_Links.html">using these bifurcated computers</a> as a heat solution. Put all the electronics in one room, and just run fiber to the I/O devices in another room. * An interesting <a href="http://weblog.garyturner.net/archives/001740.html">observation on home storage</a> – gary asserts that home storage needs are surpassing busines storage needs. I guess this is not surprising, the video subsystem in PC is driven by consumer apps, not business apps, so why not storage?

OK it sounds like you need a small team of scientists, a truckload of equipment, and some incredibly expensive optics, so I guess we won’t see a Nikon Coolpix version soon. But hey that sounds like what it took initially to make a mainframe computer run and look where we are. Actually I don’t care that much about gigapixel cameras – but boy would I give an arm and a leg for gigapixel eyeglasses – realtime zooming in on images miles away would be handy. * Have to get a <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/News/Story/0,1585,a4-c407-n350,00.html">Babble</a> when they are available – <em>“In essence, Babble turns you into a small crowd–and changes how other people hear your voice,” he added. “The result is that those outside your workspace cannot understand your actual spoken words.”</em> .

				<p><p>Lots of posts recently as people realize that we aren’t going to see cable/satellite HD feeds into MCE machines for a long time – <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000620044935/">No CableCARD for Windows Media Center until Longhorn (probably)</a>, Say It Ain’t So Joe… <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=1531">Why HDTV Support in MCE Won’t Change Until Longhorn Arrives</a>. Not at all shocking, the PC is DRM swiss cheese. Certainly suggests that the closed boxes – TIVO, captive settop boxes – have a long life yet in the home. I bet that you don’t see HDTV support on the PC until you can run a separate OS in a separate VM with hardware-enforced DRM – ie, until you can run a closed hardware/software box inside a PC.</p>

<p>Meanwhile tho, the MCE developer economy continues to grow – <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=320">here’s a list of plugins you can install</a>. Regardless of HD capability, these boxes make way cool DVD players. As does the <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2005_05_15_archive.htm#111625442821583132">XBOX 360</a>. Sure seems to me that the DVD player market will break into two – cheap low-end fixed function players, and then at the high end, people will put in an XBOX, Mac Mini, MCE, or PS3 box.</p>

<p>Another interesting idea is the <a href="http://www.tvharmony.com/blog/archives/2005/05/echostar_to_rol.html">PocketDish</a>. This seems compelling to me, if I could take all my Tivo or Dish content on the road, without futzing around with a full laptop pc, I’d be interested.</p>

<p>Some interesting <a href="http://www.mindjack.com/feature/piracy051305.html">thoughts by Mark Pesce</a> on the future of TV – <em>“The idea of an advertising payload attached unobtrusively to the television program has a certain appeal; it can be ignored, but it’s always present. The audience can’t edit it out of the program without destroying the content of the program. Audiences will learn accept them — so long as the advertisements aren’t too busy, distracting, or otherwise obnoxious.”</em> We’ve watched this whole season of Alias via torrent downloads and I would have been happy to get an HD download direct from ABC or my affiliate which had modest advertising content in it.</p>

				<p><p>Our extended family of bloggers are becoming overactive, it is hard for me to keep up. Highlights:</p>

<p>* Rich is digging into MT - <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/blogs/2005/05/20/mt_categories.html">nice tip on category tags</a>, and he <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/blogs/2005/05/20/tongfamily_templates.html">graciously posts his templates</a> – nice idea, I will do this when I am finished hacking on mine too. * Rich on computers – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/2005/05/24/computer_ergonomics.html">proper ergonomics</a> (I’ve been getting a stiff neck recently, good tips), <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/05/27/sony_t350.html">and the new evdo-equipped sony laptop</a> – wifi hotspots are becoming a mess, with 4-5 available in a location of uncertain quality and safety, evdo and similar solutions could become a hit with the business crowd. * Phil with some <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/home-networking-resources.html">great thinking on search scoping</a>, <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/announcing-berry-411-version-22.html">releasing the latest version of Berry 411</a> (installed), talking about <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/myvoipweb.html">myvoipweb</a> (don’t trust caller id anymore), showing off <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/recommended-jobs-feed.html">his jobs sidebar</a> (very cool). * Kudos <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net//2005/05/22/melodeo_launches_on_rogers.html">to Melodeo for Rogers launch</a> * Martin is <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/more_meat_for_t.html">bullish on NPUs</a>. * John and Rich’s <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/05/24/taiwanese_edition.html">book out in Taiwan and Korea now</a>! Guys I’d love to hear about the economics behind this. * Jason on <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/rss_jobs_aggreg.html">RSS Jobs aggregators</a>, <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/job_blog_explos.html">job blogs</a>, <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/good_to_great_s.html">good to great staffing</a>, <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/we_just_launche.html">Jobster 1.1 launch</a>. The jobster team is reminding me that incredible focus on an exact customer segment and exact customer problems will always pay off. * <a href="http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2005/05/consumer_passio.html">Andy fishing for ideas on how to create passion amongst his customers</a>. My 2 cents Andy - learn from the Jobster guys! * Not an ignition extended family blog, but related to our business – Fred has <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=1120">a nice posting on the “pass”</a>:</p>

<p>** <em>Say no quickly to the things you know you aren’t going to do</em> ** <em>Don’t take an opportunity into diligence unless you are willing to spend enough time to truly undersand it, and if you don’t invest, make sure you are willing to spend time explaining why.</em></p>

				<p><p>This weekend’s best hike was up Squak Mountain. <a href="http://www.ci.issaquah.wa.us/page.asp?navid=526">The City of Issaquah website lists trailheads</a> – we started at Mountainside Drive. Nice steady uphill hike for 2 miles – gets the heart pumping, but not so extreme that it kills you.</p>

<p>It is a state park but for some reason the <a href="http://www.parks.wa.gov/alpha.asp">state park website</a> doesn’t list it, and I found no good maps online. But the trails are well marked and pretty well maintained.</p>

				<p><p>* “The Rings of Saturn”:amazon. Difficult to get in the mood of this one. A solitary travel through modern england – dry, depressing tourism. There are no characters in the book besides the author, despite his wandering about present day England. I couldn’t finish – I guess it reinforces that life is all about the people you live it with, not about the places or things. * “Starfish by Peter Watts”:amazon. Wow a seriously good story. Characters have real meat, deeply damaged (by life? by design? an unresolved mystery) but deeply human. Layers of story here, it really draws you in. * “Freakonomics”:amazon. A solid nonfiction read. Entertaining, crisp, not bloated. The right length. The kind of economist I’d love to be, if I could. And a nice <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog.php">blog</a> * “The Magic Mountain”:amazon. I am really struggling with this one. The characters are boring but subtly compelling. But boy a whole lot of nothing happens in the story. I may need to save this book for a quieter location and time.</p>

<p>Oh and <a href="http://listsofbests.com/news/#000057">another award winner list – the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award</a>. Some of these look interesting.</p>

				<p><p>Based on <a href="http://www.zagula.com/food_and_wine/2005/05/19/seven_stars_pepper.html">john’s reco</a>, we found our way to seven stars pepper. A little hard to find but it was tasty – the Chong Gin chicken john reco’ed was excellent. But at the end of the meal we all agreed – chinese food is just not our favorite asian cuisine, we far prefer the flavors and spices of thai food.</p>

<p>Also we ate at <a href="http://www.serafinaseattle.com/">serafina</a> for lunch one day. Great great italian, we consistently like the Melanzane alla Serafina (eggplant rolls). Parking can be painful at busy times.</p>
