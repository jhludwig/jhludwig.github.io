				<p><p>Rich discusses <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/08/iphone-apps-u-have-to-have/">the apps he likes</a>. Some good ideas here, and I’ve made a few changes as well since <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2009/04/my-current-iphone-app-setup-what-am-i-missing/">I last talked about apps</a>. Here is what I am using right now:</p>

<p>* Bottom Row: Mail, Messages, Calendar, Safari. Mail, Messages, Safari get heavy heavy use. Calendar less so but still need it at hand all the time. * First Page: ** Weather, Stocks, Maps, Camera, Calculator, Settings, Clock, Phone from Apple. Stocks sees the least use, I wonder if I should kick it down a page. Or maybe I should replace it with a better portfolio report app. Calculator doesn’t see much use in summer here but will earn its spot this fall. Settings is only there for me to turn airplane mode on/off and wifi on/off – is there something simpler to do this? ** Twitterfon and Facebook. Recently replaced Tweetie with Twitterfon, just looks a little fresher. Tweetdeck seems like overkill on the iPhone. ** Tripit. Love Tripit. May even kick up to the paid pro version. ** 2 Across for my NYT crossword fix. ** Wordpress for blogging. ** Appigo Todo for todo lists, integrated with RTM on the backend. ** Shazam for identifying music. I am doing this less and less tho (still listening to music a ton), so it may get pushed off. ** ESPN Scorecenter. This one has not earned its spot yet but I am thinking it will during NCAA Football season and I have it configured and ready to go. If it gets score updates as quickly as the website it will be a winner. * 2nd page or later apps that still see some use: ** Amazon.com of course. Though it doesn’t seem as easy to find kindle items in the app as it is on the website ** Flight Update for checking on inbound family members. ** Kayak. ** MiGhtyDocs for accessing google docs. ** Urbanspoon. ** Air Sharing and Air Contacts. Not used that often but lifesavers every once in a while. ** WeFiFoFum. Not essential but a nicer way to see wifi nets around you. ** Smugshot for dealing with smugmug ** Starmap because every once in while I haul the telescope out, mostly to look at planets * Stuff I am trialing: ** Pogoplug. Don’t know yet if It will stick ** CardStar. Trying based on Rich’s reco * And finally, casual games: ** DoodleJump. Stupidly entertaining ** ParaPanic. Ditto ** Robot Master. Annoying, how do people get those high scores?</p>

				<p><p>Two meaty books this week, a strange but natural pairing:</p>

<p>* “The Power Of Myth”:amazon by Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyers. On the shelf forever, a great book about some of the deep issues of life and humanity. One sentence of this book has more insight into humanity than all of Kurzweil’s book. Not a light read. * “QED”:amazon by Richard P. Feynman. Simple (to the degree that anything quantum can be simple) explanation of the basics of quantum electrodynamics. When you read this, you have to wonder why we continue to stuff deterministic models of chemistry and physics down the throats of high school students, only to have to rip it out when they get to higher level sciences in college. There is no reason we can’t start with quantum science at the beginning, this stuff is very approachable.</p>

<p>Together these two books provide nice bookends on the nature of the universe – at one end, the squirelly but true behaviour of the universe at the quantum level; at the other, the squirrelly behaviour of humans and the deep motivations of our behaviour.</p>

<p>* Michigan. Can they take steps back to respectability? The best rivalry in sports needs drama to sustain itself. * SC. How good how fast, and will they learn to win the games they ought to win? * UW. My adoptive hometown team, will a new coach get them off the mat? * Florida. Hoping the rest of the SEC mans up and pins a couple losses on them. * Denison. Go Red Raiders! Only because a member of extended family is on the team.</p>

				<p><p>Some more serious non-fiction – two good, one drivel:</p>

<p>* “The Post-American World”:amazon by Fareed Zakaria. A little dated by financial events of the last year and, like all nonfiction books, really ought to be a pamphlet. But still some great core points about the US and it’s place in the world. The future is not to be feared because of waning US influence, but to be embraced because of the growth and development of so many other parts of the world. Amazon says 4 stars, I ding it a little bit for length but still a good book. * “The Only Three Questions That Count”:amazon by Ken Fisher. One successful investor’s view on how to invest. Insightful and worth a read, the discussion on national debt levels alone is worth the book. Successful investing is clearly not something done as a hobby, it takes a serious amount of discipline and analysis to follow his guide – not surprising. Oh the book is way too long though, where was the editor? Amazon says 4.5 stars, I would agree that there is great content in here. * “The Singularity Is Near”:amazon by Ray Kurzweil. I found this to be nearly unreadable. First the early nonsense about the knees of exponential functions (a bogus notion), then the unending blather about order and information (where was the editor?), and I just gave up. Maybe there are genius ideas in here but I suspect the author vastly underestimates the complexity and sophistication of our evolved biological structures. Feels like Wolfram’s “A New Kind Of Science” – the author is all fired up about his “insights” but didn’t bother to get any critical review. Amazon says 4 stars, I give this a 1.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">02 August 2009</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Is this the year of speech recognition? GigaOM thinks speech recognition is getting ready to take off – <a href="http://pro.gigaom.com/2009/08/is-speech-recognition-technology-finally-ready-for-prime-time/">Is Speech-Recognition Technology Finally Ready for Prime Time?</a></p>

<p>IN 2006 AnandTech had similar headlines – <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/multimedia/showdoc.aspx?i=2744&amp;p=1">Speech Recognition – Ready for Prime-Time?</a></p>

<p>CNN called it in 2001 – <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/06/06/auto.speech.idg/">Speech Recognition Technology will hear you now</a> – “After years of hype and false starts, automated speech recognition (ASR) technology is ready for prime time”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/Editorial/Feature/CALL-CENTERS-%3CBR%3E-The-Business-Case-for-Speech-in-the-Call-Center-29594.aspx">SpeechTechMag made the claim in 1999</a> – Speech recognition technology is “ready for prime time”</p>

<p>Apparently Comdex buzz in 1998 was that <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/0,1000000091,2069961,00.htm">1999 would be the year of speech recognition</a>. Again.</p>

<p>At one point in the mid/late 90’s, the Microsoft Speech Recognition team worked for me thanks to a reorg. All great people, very enthusiastic speech supporters, and convinced that widespread speech recognition was right around the corner. I loved the team but it seemed apparent that the hardware and software were both generations away from achieving useful speech recognition and so ultimately I worked to get the team moved to Microsoft Research.</p>

<p>So call me a skeptic. Over the past 15 years, you would have done well to always bet on “No” as the answer to “Is this the year of speech recognition?” I don’t see a lot of reason to change the bet. Speech is tough, we are demanding, we expect a system to respond to conversational input – rapid, lots of colloquialisms, speaker-independent, etc. Yes there are systems that can respond reasonably well to very limited inputs but as a general use technology, I’m not yet optimistic.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">02 August 2009</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>This post is going to save someone’s as$. The information is invaluable.</p>

<p>We have a SeaRay 280 Bowrider, 1996, but I am sure the info applies to newer models. Someone (not me, I know better!) unwisely left the batteries on when they left the boat. Which of course is always a mistake on a boat. Batteries are dead.</p>

<p>And what compounds the problem is that the batteries are underneath the hydraulically lifted engine cover. Which needs battery power to open. And which weighs a ton and is linked to hydraulic lifters which effectively prevent you from just lifting it by hand. Oh crap. (This is a strange boat – large for a bowrider, small for inboard/outboard engines, any bigger and it would have a shore power connection which would solve my problem, but this boat does not).</p>

<p>The SeaRay owner’s manuals are useless (though you can download them all <a href="http://www.searay.com/Page.aspx/pageId/10552/Manuals.aspx">here</a> to your heart’s content). Clearly they don’t expect boat owners to actually ever look at the engine. So I called <a href="http://www.lakeunionsearay.com/">Lake Union Searay</a> Redmond branch – nice people, very helpful. Apparently there is some way to reach through the oil check hatch and remove pins from the hydraulic lifts to allow you to muscle the hatch cover up – but it would require an intimate knowledge of the engine compartment since you are basically reaching around blind, the hatch is just large enough for your arm and no more.</p>

<p>Here is the key trick though. If you cobble together a 12V source (battery, charger, whatever) with a cigarette lighter adapter, and plug it into the cigarette lighter 12v port at the helm (which is normally used to provide power to 12v devices), the electricity will flow back into the boat and allow you to use boat electrics – hatch cover, etc. Completely undocumented and SeaRay won’t give you the parts to do it, but the service guys admit it will work.</p>

<p>So I got a $21 small riding mower battery. Went to Fry’s and got lighter adapter hardware. Wired them together, plugged it into the cigarette lighter, and pop the breaker went in the boat. Disconnected, switched polarity, reset the breaker, and tried again. Voila!!!! Hatch cover openers worked, I can now get at the batteries and either recharge or replace as needed.</p>

<p>Additional warnings and tips:</p>

<p>* the cigarette lighter adapter from Fry’s had 16-20 gauge wire, not sure what. Whatever it was, it is not enough for longterm use – the wire got hot to the touch. So get the job done and get it out of there. * Before I went to Fry’s, I tried used an old cell phone car adapter I had lying around. I cut the phone connector off, stripped the wires. This was clearly never going to work for two reasons. One, the wires were incredibly small, I am guessing 26 gauge. They would never have been able to carry the power. Two, the lighter head of the adapter is full of rectifying/transforming electronics, stepping down the car 12v voltage/high amperage to something the phone can use. Clearly I would not be able to stuff 12V/moderate amp signals back through this.</p>

<p>Good luck, hope this helps someone.</p>
