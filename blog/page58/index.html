    <p>Another great Halloween. Hundreds and hundreds of visitors. Awesome weather.</p>

<p>A few notes for myself:</p>

<p>* Pneumatics failed. Compressed died. Why? I don’t think it was just an untimely compressor failure. I think there was some overload condition created by my load. * I placed one skeleton over a blue yard uplight just randomly. It looked awesome! I should uplight all skeletons in blue next year. * More i-zombie lightning controllers! Lightning is always popular * More fcgs! I have a couple windows that would be great. Also Kurt recommended illuminating with a moving blacklight on a panning fan base.</p>

    <p>From last week.

Warms the heart.</p>

<p>And at <a href="http://www.buckeyecommentary.com/files/a-lot-on-the-line.html#unique-entry-id-840">Buckeye Commentary</a>, an analysis I hadn’t seen of OSU’s historical failures against SEC teams. The record is not good. A hypothesis is that OSU has generally been playing against higher rated opponents in bowls as OSU fans travel well. Some reasonable data. Doesn’t explain the debacle in the desert last year tho.</p>

I turn the sound activation off, then fiddle with the controls until I get a fixed- or pulsating-diameter oval. I mount the projector about five feet above the ground and aim it down our long driveway. With even a moderate bit of fog I get a great looking oval tunnel that’s at least 50 feet long – as victims approach via the driveway, their heads are right in the middle of the tunnel for quite a distance. (Getting the beam in someone’s eyes is not really a concern since it’s moving so rapidly.) The effect of the fog being “cross-sectioned” by the beam is quite something.”</em></p>

The computer polls are a little squirrelly – I’ll accept LSU ahead of OSU in computer polls, they have played some quality teams.</p>

<p>And maybe I can take BC, though this is debatable. Nonconf foes were Army, Mass, BGSU, and ND? Inconference was Wake, NC State, GT, VT. Is this really materially better than OSU’s record?</p>

<p>But Kansas? Who played Central Michigan, SE Louisiana, Toledo, Florida Intl nonconference? and K State, Baylor, Colorado and Texas A&amp;M in conference, with narrow wins over most of those? Does Sagarin factor in the coach’s weight?</p>
