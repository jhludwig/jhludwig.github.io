  <h1><a href="/2004/05/18/search-slamming.html">Search slamming</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Spent two hours yesterday trying to get one of our machines to correctly point to Google for searches from the IE address bar. Thru a combo of spyware, browser helper objects, toolbars, the IE search function had been slammed over to a variety of different search providers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newdotnet.com/" title="NewDotNet">NewDotNet</a> was the evilest. It kept re-slamming settings no matter how often we changed them in the browser. And no matter how many times we removed it as a startup item, it would reinsert itself – spyware/virus-like behaviour. This ought to be criminal. <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/">Spybot S&amp;D</a> didn’t seem to pick this one up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.liutilities.com/products/wintaskspro/processlibrary/sahagent/">SAHAgent</a> was on the machine too – installs as a Winsock Service Provider! How do these people sleep at night? Spybot seemed to get it.</p>

<p><a href="http://sarc.com/avcenter/venc/data/adware.clearsearch.html">Clearsearch</a> was on the machine too, Spybot got it.</p>

<p>After multiple runnings of Spybot, MSConfig, Sysedit, and Regedit, we are now down to one remaining slammer. Lycos is grabbing all our autosearch traffic, tho there does not seem to be an associated browser helper object or an process running, and i’ve tried to reset a dozen times thru the IE search UI and the Google toolbar UI. Nothing detected by Spybot. But clearly something still going on.</p>

<p>It is amazing how hard these have been to get rid of. What does a regular user do – just reformat their hard disk? This spyware stuff is a plague. Pisses me off more than viruses.</p>

Actually tho it was a lot better than expected, a very clear articulation of why globalization will happen and discussions of implications and how we should react. Too long of course like every non-fiction book.</p>

<p>And then just for waiting room reading I worked thru Ben Bova’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312872186/qid=1084736208/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-6145252-2100164?v=glance&amp;s=books">Saturn</a>.

  <h1><a href="/blog/2004/05/15/mt-licensing-uproar.html">MT licensing uproar</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Our house was flu-ridden this week and I am just catching up on all the discussion about MT 3.0 licensing – good stuff by <a href="http://www.timaoutloud.org/archives/000351.html">Tim</a>, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/05/movable_type_30.shtml">Mena and the changes</a>, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">Mark Pilgrim</a>, <a href="http://www.webmink.net/2004/05/trackbacks-as-zeitgeist.htm">Simon Phipps</a>, <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_blogs/001529.html">Rich</a>. </p>

<p>Personally I have no problem paying for software that I use frequently and will happily pay something for my blog management tool.  The newly modified license looks reasonable.  I’ll look around at other solutions as <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_blogs/001536.html">Rich</a> is doing though I will be cautious in jumping – MT 2.661 is not busted for me, I am not driven to move right away, I’ll let others experiment and I will learn from that.  I have to admire SixApart for modifying their proposal quickly in the face of overwhelming criticism.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/05/15/fun-with-rdesktop.html">Fun with Rdesktop</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve been playing around with the remote desktop feature in XP.  I have to say, within the house, between XP machines, it works pretty well.  Good perf, very little latency, pretty good rendering.</p>

<p>I also tried using the Rdesktop tool in Knoppix against my XP machine.  It did work with a little more trouble (you can’t just enter a “netbios” name, you have to address the remote machine using it’s IP address).  It has some rendering problems – odd color matching, fonts don’t look as nice, etc.  But it works. </p>

<p>For extra credit I fired up my vpn client and connected to work, and then opened up an XP-to-XP remote desktop session.  Then from another machine running Knoppix in the house, I rdesktop’d to the XP machine in the house.  And yes you can daisychain these sessions.  Rendering became really funky at this point however. </p>

<p>I’ve read several places online that people recommend <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">VNC</a> in place of rdesktop.  If I get in the practice of doing remote control frequently from a linux box i will have to try this out.</p>

    <p>Kevin posts that <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/acc/archives/001028.php">Facilities are the new ACC battleground</a>.  Facilities, along with staff, are the great unregulated expense items left to college football programs.  You can’t stock up on players due to scholarship limits, you can’t pay players.  But you can spend boatloads of money on first class facilities which are a significant recruiting draw.  And you can spend boatloads on staff which can provide a significantly better level of service for potential recruits and current players. </p>

<p>The leadership programs in the ACC, SEC, and Big10 are all spending significantly in these areas.  I don’t know much about the Big-12 but I’d guess they are there to.  Now go back to my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001341.html">earlier post about Pac-10 budgets</a> – the Pac-10 seems to have a real budget shortfall, the schools are going to have to take large steps to remain competitive.</p>

    <p>Various posts that I found compelling:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.evhead.com/archives/2004_05_01_archive.asp#108361672529033654">Evan WIlliams</a> found this anecdote: “A 14-year-old from California, Justin Fong, asked what advice Buffett and Munger would give a young person on how to be successful. ‘It’s better to hang out with people better than you,’ said Buffett. ‘Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you’ll drift in that direction.’ Added Munger drily, ‘If this gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group, the hell with ‘em.’” * Seb has a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2004/05/03.html#a1562">list of visionaries</a> he likes to follow * Tyler Cowen on <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/05/subjective_time.html">subjective time</a> – wow, 70+% of my life is over as subjectively perceived. * Over at <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/05/05/PHPAndMath.html">gadgetopia</a>, a pointer to <a href="www.phpmath.com">PHPMath</a> – a lot of interesting math implemented in PHP. * <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/">Acoustic Cryptanalysis</a></p>

    <p>Here’s the stuff I noted out of the flood of coverage:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000642.php" title="John Battelle's Searchblog: The Incubation Platform">John Battelle’s Searchblog: The Incubation Platform</a> – i think a TON of isvs would love to be able to store user state data in the google store and get the benefits of ubiquitous availability, reliability, etc. * <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/000640.php">Speculation on how google will spend all their capital dollars</a> in ‘04. Not very deep but an interesting question to ask. * <a href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000593.html">Mitch Kapor’s view</a> on the filing. Personally I find the dual-class structure a little worrying, I doubt I will put money in. * <a href="http://www.sjl.us/main/2004/04/google_pagerank.html">Surprising fact</a> about Google’s license to the pagerank algorithm. * a list of <a href="http://www.investors.com/breakingnews.asp?journalid=20976716&amp;brk=1">google-watching blogs</a>.</p>

    <p>Lots of stuff to read here…just some for the things I noticed:</p>

More details on the <a href="http://www.longhornblogs.com/ndunlap/archive/2004/05/07/3413.aspx">UI bits here</a>. * <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1588026,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">Server futures</a> – the VM stuff is interesting * Lots of <a href="http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/index.php?p=1854">media center push</a> – “…the PC is running out of time.” – not sure I buy that. * <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-5207576.html?tag=nefd.top">Tiers of UI experience</a> – shades of Win286, Win386, etc. Interesting that the tiering is being driven by the graphics processors and not the CPUs.

    <p>Tong just gave me a copy of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/virtualpc/">MSFT’s Virtual PC</a> – $10 at the company store, what the heck. But kind of hilarious, the box and website are in denial about Linux – there is no mention of Linux as a guest OS – even tho they proudly mention their support for MSDOS and OS/2 Warp.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vmware.com/request_processor?nextPage=/vmwarestore/newstore/category.jsp&amp;action=CATALOG.GETGROUPS&amp;application=store&amp;ProductGroupCodes=WKST4-WIN,WKST4-LX" title="VMware Store">VMware</a> meanwhile is $189 (that price needs to come down!) and has clear support for linux as host or guest.</p>
