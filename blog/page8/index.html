				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">11 January 2021</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I aspire to be a lifelong learner. I do read a lot – books and online – and I find increasingly that if I don’t take a few moments to write down and reflect on what I learned, then I don’t really learn it. So am starting a new attempt to document interesting things I learned each week. Inspired in part by <a href="https://medium.com/fluxx-studio-notes/52-things-i-learned-in-2020-6a380692dbb8">Tom Whitwell</a>, referred to by <a href="http://www.markfrauenfelder.com">Mark Frauenfelder</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/clams-measure-water-quality-poland-fat-kathy/">Warsaw uses clams to monitor its water supply</a>. We would need a vast array of sensors and AI machinery to do the same with computers, and we probably don’t know what all things to sense or what models to build. Instead, we just rely on some clams to be clams. Fascinating collaboration with nature and thought-provoking, can we collaborate similarly in other areas?</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.a-ibs.com/en/blog/article/green-apples-blue-apples-color-perception-in-japanese.html">There are cultures that do not discriminate between the colors blue and green</a>, including Japan historically. I’ve read other pieces on the history of color perception, very interesting that this is somewhat variable across human cultures, it seems so foundational. What else is not as foundational as we think?</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_101">There is a large tuned mass damper inside the Taipei 101 building</a> and other large skyscrapers. Which makes sense and at some level I probably knew this, but interesting to see in action.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin">Sea urchins have 5-fold symmetry</a>. I am still trying to parse the explanation for why this evolved, it doesn’t seem obvious.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemipenis">Lizards have 2 penises</a>. I guess this is no more unnatural than having two arms, legs, eyes, ears, kidneys, etc. Bilateral symmetry is easier to understand in animals than 5-fold symmetry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, and how fragile our democracy is, and how inspiring it is to see a large cross section of our society rise and start to defend it.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">01 January 2021</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>This year I read or attempted to read 75 books.  There were some dogs but also some great ones.  I tried to come up with the “best book of the year” but that is pointless, they are all so different.  So I will highlight a number of different books that excelled in different ways. </p>

<p><strong>Best Mystery</strong>:  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/523795.The_Last_Good_Kiss">The Last Good Kiss</a> by James Crumley.  A solid hard-bitten detective tale, everything you want in a private eye.  </p>

<p><strong>Best Adventure</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora">The Lies of Locke Lamora</a> by Scott Lynch.  If you like more fantastical adventures, this is a great tale and really ought to be a movie or TV series.</p>

<p><strong>Best Historical Novel</strong>:  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38140077-washington-black">Washington Black</a> by Esi Edugyan.  If you like your adventures a little more grounded in historical reality, this is for you.  Would also be fantastic on screen.</p>

<p><strong>Best History</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50159458-kent-state">Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio</a> by Derf Backderf.  If you like actual history, this is a great telling of the events at Kent State, and exposes the dangers of involving armed military in civil protests.  Almost chose this for best graphic novel, but for…</p>

<p><strong>Best Graphic Novel</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51323365-solutions-and-other-problems">Solutions and Other Problems</a> by Allie Brosh.  Irreverent, at times hilarious, at times moving.  Well done.  </p>

<p><strong>Best Irreverent</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28881.Lamb">Lamb, The Gospel According to Biff, Christ’s Childhood Pal</a> by Christoper Moore. Irreverent, some may even view as offensive, but I found it respectful and uplifting in a humanist way.</p>

<p><strong>Best Current Events</strong>:  Getting back to our current situation and lives, there are 3 books that I enjoyed and gave me some insight on myself or the world.  </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50165554-one-billion-americans">One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger</a> by Matthew Yglesias.  You might object to his solution but this book clearly focuses on a challenge we face, and it is hard to imagine solutions that don’t involve growth.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth">The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics</a> by Eric Beinhocker.  A worthy effort to reexamine economics from first principles.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152447-caste">Caste: The Origins of our Discontents</a> by Isabel Wilkerson.  There are many books you can read on discrimination and racism in our society, this was the best for me.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best Math/Science</strong>.  Digging a little deeper, these were the math/science books that I enjoyed the most this year.  </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36341728-lost-in-math">Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray</a> by Sabine Hossenfelder.  A criticism of current thinking in physics.  I don’t follow physics closely enough to know if this is all warranted.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting">Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction</a> by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner.  We all forecast in our lives, and we are probably all not that great at it, as this book will make you realize.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27068734-but-what-if-we-re-wrong-thinking-about-the-present-as-if-it-were-the-pa">But What If We’re Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past</a> by Chuck Klosterman.  Challenges your thinking about what you know and believe, which is always good.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Would love to hear your thoughts on books you read this year.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25597172-the-blizzard">The Blizzard</a> by Vladimir Sorokin. A book about a terrible storm written by a Russian author? I expected some serious gloom, but this story was trippy and strange. Memorable but weird.</li>

Calling out the National Guard is almost never a good idea.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6004724-the-snakehead">The Snakehead</a> by Patrick Radden Keefe. Inside the illegal immigration trade for a period of the 90s. A rough trade, amazing what people will go through for a chance to better their lives and their family’s lives.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31253737-an-american-sickness">An American Sickness</a> by Elisabeth Rosenthal. An anecdote-driven walk through the dysfunctional health care industry. Some enraging anecdotes, and some useful how-to’s at the end. Would have liked even more data but overall a very useful read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36602943-the-origin-of-wealth">The Origin of Wealth</a> by Eric D. Beinhocker. An excellent book, re-establishing the basis of economics and wealth from first principles, overturning a lot of the traditional economics I learned once upon a time. Very satisfying to see economics built up as emergent behaviors from the actions of individuals, and to see the incorporation of uncertainty, imperfect information, and iteration. Not a complete story but excellent.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune">Dune</a> by Frank Herbert. Read ~45 years ago (BTW: I am old), upcoming movie motivated me to reread (Chalamet was born for this role). The book is still good but not perfect. Herbert’s imagined world is fascinating. He rushes thru the story – in today’s world, “Dune” alone would expand into 7 books à la Game of Thrones. Some very topical themes. The last scene is just goofy and off, let’s hope that gets a better treatment in the movie. But overall still a very interesting book.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42275312-the-escape-room">The Escape Room</a> by Megan Goldin. Eh. Too much deus ex machina.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20980667-the-mechanical">The Mechanical</a> by Ian Tregillis. Fun tale of alternate history with clockwork robots. Very different set of guiding principles than Asimov’s.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.hbo.com/euphoria">Euphoria</a> is an explosive series. High school like I never experienced, kids struggling with big issues, and I was rooting for them all and blown away by them all. I never expected to like a high school drama, but this is an intense and deep show.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy">Ted Lasso</a> is funny and touching. Jason Sudeikis plays a lovable, optimistic, vulnerable role that is very endearing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://taylor.lnk.to/folkloredlxWE">Folklore</a> by Taylor Swift. I am not generally a huge Taylor fan but this has been the soundtrack of our summer. I love the stripped down presentation.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43256597-night-boat-to-tangier">Night Boat to Tangier</a> by Kevin Barry. Another great novel by Barry, two men’s lives explored over the course of an evening, great characters and dialog.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48654.Story">Story</a> by Robert McKee. I have no intention of ever writing a screenplay, but this book is highly useful for anyone who needs to communicate ideas – really forces you to think about your story and how to structure it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38322550-the-last-emperox">The Last Emperox</a> by John Scalzi. The first book in this series was interesting, and this closing was satisfying but not particularly memorable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9178059-shakedown">Shakedown</a> by Steven Malanga. There may be some good points in here, but the author doesn’t really help himself get his point out. One, he doesn’t really articulate what his goals are besides railing at unions and the new left. I know he hates union influence in education but I don’t really know what he wants to do about education. Two, he brings out a lot of data in anecdotal form, but never gives the overall context. I don’t know how upset to be about a certain number unless I understand overall spending, what a successful budget looks like, some success examples, etc. Three, he loves to use pejorative words like like “corpulent” and “porcine” and “lavish” and “stratospheric” in place of data, and that is just off-putting – as if he knows he can’t make his case rationally, so he is trying to inflame instead. And anyone who uses these words to describe teacher compensation seems a little disconnected from reality – I don’t know a lot of teachers celebrating their outrageous economic good fortune.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14662.The_Red_and_the_Black">The Red and the Black</a> by Stendhal. Time travel! Reading a book written in 1830 gives you a little view back into that world. Some archaic wording but human nature hasn’t changed, and the book structure seems almost modern.</li>
