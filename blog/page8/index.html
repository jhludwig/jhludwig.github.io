  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Tobias-Hill-ebook/dp/B002QHATL0">The Hidden</a> by Tobias Hill. An amazon review <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/200px-Thirteenthtale.jpg"><img src="images/200px-Thirteenthtale.jpg" alt="200px-Thirteenthtale" /></a>mentions “style without substance” and that seems dead on. A moody setting and some interesting construction, but a really boring book.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heavens-Shadow-David-S-Goyer/dp/1937007642">Heaven’s Shadow</a> by David Goyer and Michael Cassutt. Probably should just re-read Rendezvous with Rama.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thirteenth-Tale-Novel-Diane-Setterfield/dp/0743298039">The Thirteenth Tale</a> by Diane Setterfield. A biographer uncovers an unexpected tale, and resolves issues in her own life. A good tale, possibly the ugliest cover art ever tho.</li>
  <li>The Hare With The Amber Eyes by Edmund de Waal. A family history as told thru their ownership of Japanese netsuke. Strangely compelling. The author’s rationalization of his family’s ownership of these netsuke in contrast to his justified outrage about the appropriate of his family’s property during WWII is a little hard to accept.</li>

  <h1><a href="/2015/09/09/yay-college-football-is-your-program-heading-in-the-right-direction.html">Yay College Football! Is your program heading in the right direction?</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Thank goodness the season has started, and in robust fashion for Ohio State! The program is in great hands and great things are expected. How about your program? This time of year everyone is always filled with great hope for their team, but dreams will soon be dashed (in WSU’s case, horribly so). Unfortunately, some programs are destined for disappointment because they are fundamentally on the wrong strategy, mostly because demographics have passed them by.</p>

<p>I’ve been trading some notes with my other college football buddies, and we’ve articulated the 5 ways that a program can succeed in the modern era:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Be in a region with a large natural talent base</strong>. Southern regions are best for this — Florida, Texas, Southern California – and US demographics continue to flow this way. Neighboring schools in Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Arizona can get in on this too. There are a few northern regions that also qualify — Ohio &amp; environs, Northern California (not well exploited), Chicago, Boston-Washington corridor (not well exploited). This strategy works because most players like to stay somewhat close to home – because they are young, because they want family to see them. The best schools following this strategy also generate enough of a profile to allow them to recruit nationally for top talent. <strong>Schools in any other region cannot follow this strategy</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>the sugar daddy approach</strong>. This is the Oregon strategy — make an insane investment in the program so that you can draw kids from anywhere who are wowed by your staff and facilities. Oklahoma State is trying this with T Boone. Maryland may try this with UnderArmour. Any school can try this if they have a sugar daddy. (I am sure Nebraska has tried this, but they should be groveling at Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger’s feet).</li>
  <li><strong>the system approach</strong>. Focus on a particular type of 3 star talent that is available near you and nationally, and build a system to optimize that talent. This is the Tom Osborne era Nebraska strategy, the RichRod/WVU strategy, the Chris Peterson/Boise strategy. This can be very successful but requires a strong individual and strong culture. It is fragile and tends not to survive coaching changes. Any school can try it.</li>
  <li><strong>the academic excellence approach</strong>. Be a top 5-10 institution but leave an admissions door open for athletics. This is the Stanford, Northwestern approach. <strong>Your typical school cannot follow this approach</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>The Notre Dame strategy</strong>. To a lesser extent the BYU strategy. Be the favorite choice for a particular demographic segment. <strong>Not generally available to other schools</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are the options. Nothing else seems terribly viable. Now it is interesting to look at various schools that I follow and see how they line up against that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>USC, Ohio State are on strategy 1 and generally executing well. USC was better in the last decade at it, OSU may be better this decade.</li>
  <li>Michigan. A confused program. They are trying strategy 1 but the demographics have run away from them. Is Harbaugh the guy to build a system approach? He doesn’t think that way and he is a demonstrated mercenary. Hmm.</li>
  <li>Washington. Perhaps also confused. While the Northwest has had great population growth, I don’t think it has translated into great high school football growth. Yet Washington is trying strategy 1, tho they hired a strategy 3 coach. An interesting experiment.</li>
  <li>Nebraska. Years of coaching changes have left them adrift, the Osborne era system has been torn down. They need to figure out how to recommit to that strategy.</li>
  <li>It is interesting that Cal has never been able to capitalize on the bay area talent base.</li>
  <li>It is interesting that no one has capitalized on the Northeast talent base. It will be very interesting to follow Maryland with their Underarmour ties, a potential double whammy strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enough meandering, Go Bucks!

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misterioso-Crime-Novel-Vintage-Lizard/dp/0307388034">Misterioso</a> by Arne Dahl. I’m not sure what the state of the art in book translation is these days, but I am sure it is heavily automated. This story is ok, but feels like a rush translation job – some strange and stale structuring, some pronoun confusion at times. I suspect the original is better than this.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orenda-Joseph-Boyden/dp/034580645X">The Orenda</a> by Joseph Boyden. Life during the 1600s in the Americas from the viewpoint of a Huron tribe. Fascinating milieu and great characters. Not for the squeamish, life was brutal.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gates-Samuel-Johnson-Tale-ebook/dp/B002QJZ9Y0">The Gates</a> by John Connolly. Suburban idlers accidentally open the gates to Hell, and it is up to young Samuel Johnson to save the day. Kind of funny but forgettable.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rolling-Deep-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B00VR2L60S">Rolling in the Deep</a> by Mira Grant. Light Horror, don’t screw around with mermaids, they are not what they seem. Fun, but I mostly read because Grant has done such other good work.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Finders-Keepers-Novel-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B00P42WROG">Finders Keepers</a> by Stephen King. A fine detective novel, but makes me miss the glory days of the author.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Girl-All-Gifts-M-Carey-ebook/dp/B00CO7FLFG">The Girl With All The Gifts</a> by M. R. Carey. Not all zombies are bad. Not all people are good. Maybe we should just let the zombies win.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Pass-Resurrection-Man-Novel-ebook/dp/B00TONI5LU">Snake Pass</a> by Colin Campbell. An attempt to start a Jack Reacher-like franchise, and not a bad attempt. I will read the next.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Novel-Book-1-ebook/dp/B0052RDJAO">Legend</a> by Marie Lu. Yet another post-apocalyptic dystopia. Probably better than most, but I don’t know that I need another series in this genre.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Character-David-Brooks/dp/081299325X">The Road to Character</a> by David Brooks. The opening essay (largely reprinted in the NY Times a while back) was terrific, but the character studies themselves were only OK. I would have preferred to see some more contemporary stories. Tho the message got through – building great character doesn’t come easily to anyone, it is a lifelong daily struggle, confronting and overcoming the weaker parts of your nature.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matchbox-Theatre-Thirty-Short-Entertainments/dp/194114750X">Matchbox Theatre</a> by Michael Frayn. A quick read, some gems, but grew a little old.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mists-Avalon-Marion-Zimmer-Bradley/dp/0345350499">The Mists of Avalon</a> by Marion Zimmer Bradley. Been on the shelf forever. Good read from a very different viewpoint, I’m not sure I could have waded thru yet another typical retelling of the story.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Divers-Adventure-Americans-Everything/dp/0375760989">Shadow Divers</a> by Robert Kurson. Great true story about deep sea divers after a mysterious U-boat. Great characters, life and death drama, an excellent window into a world I knew little about.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pirate-Hunters-Treasure-Obsession-Legendary/dp/1400063361">Pirate Hunters</a> by Robert Kurson. An attempt to capture the magic again of Shadow Divers. A fine story but pales next to Shadow Divers.</li>

  <h1><a href="/2015/05/30/canary-seems-like-a-better-dropcam-modulo-some-quality-issues.html">Canary seems like a better Dropcam, modulo some quality issues</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I installed the <a href="http://canary.is/">Canary</a> home monitoring cam this am.</p>

<p>It is positioned as “Smart Home Security for Everyone”. It is about an 8” tall sleek cylinder with a usb power connection. Key product details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HD camera with wide-angle lens + mic. Purportedly also has night vision support.</li>
  <li>wifi or ethernet backhaul. If you choose wifi, rather than doing the private wifi network dance that many of these devices do, you use a provided audio mic cable and the smartphone app. the smartphone app sends setup info over the audio cable using modem protocols. it seems simpler than the wifi dance.</li>
  <li>smartphone app</li>
  <li>temperature, humidity, airquality monitor. also accelerometer, i guess you can monitor whether it is moved?</li>
  <li>90 db alarm. this only activates if you ask it to from the smartphone app.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have several <a href="http://canary.is/plans/">plan options</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free: last 12 hours recorded, 5 clips in the cloud permanently. so this seems better than dropcam free tier.</li>
  <li>$10/month: last 7 days always available, 50 clips stored permanently. dropcam-ish – i.e. egregiously expensive app-specific storage</li>
  <li>$20/month: last 30 days available, 100 video clips stored permanently. In case you wanted even more egregiously expensive storage</li>
  <li>$40/month: last 90 days available, 250 clips stored permanently. And even more.</li>
  <li>for an additional $10/month they will hook you up to call center monitoring. i imagine that video is not sent to call center, just events (i.e. akin to existing home security systems). This seems like competitive pricing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initial Reactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>install was painless. i like the audio cable approach. tho if the device has a camera, why do you need an audio cable at all — why can’t you just display a sequence of QR-codes (or equivalent) on the smart phone app.</li>
  <li>it really struggles to deliver HD video over wifi. lots of frame drops. the video is close to unusable as a result. There must be a compression choice that could address this.</li>
  <li>it uses your smartphone location to auto switch from home to away mode. i.e. when i am in the house, it notes events, but doesn’t send me alerts. when i leave house, it will start sending me alerts. this is nice.</li>
  <li>it has a “privacy” mode where camera and mic are disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a much more focused and complete security solution than drop cam — alarm, remote monitoring service, etc. Setup was simple. I could see replacing my dropcam with this.</p>

<p>It is still tho terribly expensive. The frame dropping issue is a problem. There might be some robustness issues, I’ve had some problems reliably connecting to my streams. If the quality improves tho this might be a good step up.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2015/05/21/i-am-dubious-about-the-tesla-powerwall.html">I am dubious about the Tesla Powerwall</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/buderus.jpg"><img src="images/buderus.jpg" alt="buderus" /></a>I spent the morning decoding error messages and tracing water lines for my radiant heat boiler. Initially the codes told me that I had insufficient water pressure on the feed line, and when I fixed that, then the boiler said that the output temperature was not responding as expected – likely because I left the resupply line open, and was trying to heat up a very large body of cold water. Or maybe not, because there is supposed to be a backflow valve preventing that. Whatever, I am operational again after downloading two very large manuals and learning more about burner error codes and operations than I ever wanted to.</p>

<p>This was on top of a separate plumbing issue we’ve been wrestling with for a month.</p>

<p>I don’t think most people want to spend time on the electricity, water, hot water, sewer, or other utilities. They just want it all to work when they hit the button. And are willing to spend a little bit of money to make that happen. Most people just want centrally supplied and centrally managed utilities. To switch to local supply/generation/storage, the savings have to be incredibly dramatic, or you have to value your time at a very low rate, or there must be no central alternative (ie off-grid locations). I am dubious that this will ever be the case in urban/suburban US or other major economies.</p>

<p>I also don’t want a 200 pound lump of lithium in my garage.</p>

Supposed to be a fun exploration of math in our lives, but I don’t think anyone is going to really like this book. For people that hate math, there is too much math and too little backstory.

The story of Teddy Roosevelt’s Amazon expedition after his last failed presidential run. I never realized what an epic disaster this trip was, the team was in no way ready for the rigors of the Amazon.

    <p>This latest Amazon Echo feature is awesome and horrible. Amazon is making it so easy to buy things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>========================================== AMAZON ECHO ==========================================</p>

  <p>Re-ordering your favorite Prime products is now even easier with Echo – just use your voice. If you’re low on kitchen supplies, want to restock on snacks, or need more rolls of duct tape for the garage, simply ask Echo to place an order for you.</p>

  <p>Just say “Alexa, re-order laundry detergent” – Echo will search your order history and can order the item for you using your default payment and shipping settings. If Echo can’t find the requested item in your order history, it may suggest an item for your approval using Amazon’s Choice, which picks highly-rated, well-priced, Prime products. You can manage your shopping preferences and set an optional confirmation code in your Amazon Echo App.</p>

  <p>Some customers, like @chmarch, will be happy to know that baby lotion works particularly well (Congrats!). https://twitter.com/chmarch/status/591686021235875840</p>

  <p>As always, the Amazon Echo team looks forward to your feedback via the Amazon Echo App and on social media (#AmazonEcho).</p>

<p>All pricy. I like the 360fly and bounce the best, they have focused scenarios they are going after. Two of the others seem to be staking claim to the “world’s first” positioning, but not sure that is actually compelling.</p>

<p>I wish I could just yoke together cheap RPI cameras, or all the cameras I already have on devices I already own.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Oh and don’t forget the <a href="http://gopro.com/spherical">goPro spherical solution</a>, this is going to be spendy.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/seattle-startup-snupi-cuts-staff-shelves-wally-home-sensor-device/">SNUPI/Wallyhome cuts staff</a> – sad to see a Seattle startup struggle, and these guys have some really interesting technology that has come out of Patel’s work.</p>

<p>But I’ve always thought that remote sensing without video (and to a lesser degree audio) is uninteresting. The first thing you want to do when a remote event is triggered is see exactly what is going on. Without that, remote sensing is just kind of frustrating. I’ve tried Wally and Smartthings and every other kind of remote sensor, the only thing that has stuck is Dropcam because it lets me see what is going on.</p>

<p>It is why cameras and video is at the heart of what we are doing at <a href="http://www.surround.io">Surround.io</a> – vision is fundamental, and solving the hard scale issues of video processing, storage and transmission puts you in a great position to deal with other types of sensor data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perkins says <strong>he’s “all in” on Apple products</strong> from the iPhone to Apple TV. And, in his line of work, he has to <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lemming.jpg"><img src="images/lemming-300x225.jpg" alt="lemming" /></a>stay abreast of important tech trends.</p>

  <p>But the main reason he’s an early adopter of the Apple Watch? “It’s the perfect sports watch,” said Perkins who plans to wear it while jogging. He’ll also wear it the office for the notifications that remind him to get to meetings on time and as a conversation piece.</p>

  <p><strong>“I will have that showpiece that everyone wants to see,” Perkins said. “I’ll be that guy for a couple of weeks.”</strong></p>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Noir-Novel-Robert-Coover/dp/1590202945">Noir</a> by Robert Coover. Noir mystery meets mushrooms. Very strange story. Engaged me but I’m not sure I’d want a steady diet of this.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lastman.jpg"><img src="images/lastman-195x300.jpg" alt="lastman" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Pradeep-Mathew-Novel/dp/1555976115">The Legend of Pradeep Mathew</a> by Shehan Karunatilaka. Very nicely written, but ultimately defeated me. My lack of any cricket knowledge and lack of any Sri Lanka knowledge put me in too deep a hole.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Speech-Child-44-Trilogy/dp/0446402419">The Secret Speech</a> by Tom Rob Smith. Excellent pageturner, not surprising, Smith writes engaging tales.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trinity-Six-Charles-Cumming/dp/B009LRMHZE">The Trinity Six</a> by Charles Cumming. Also a great pageturner, for some reason the hunt for moles inside the British intelligence community never gets old.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-Edgar-Sawtelle-Novel-P-S/dp/0061374237">The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</a> by David Wroblewski. I enjoyed, kind of an extended Greek tragedy set in rural Wisconsin. With dogs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Man-Vol-Unmanned-ebook/dp/B0064W66EC">Y: The Last Man</a> by Brian K Vaughan, Pia Guerra, Jose Marzan Jr. I don’t read many graphic novels but this got such great reviews, and it is a great tale. Every male human and male animal dies off suddenly, except for one, and the race is on to save and recreate the world. This would be a fantastic TV show, tho I’d tame down some of the comic parts a little.</li>

    <p>I see I can pre-order a <a href="https://tessel.io/">Tessel 2</a> now. Interesting part, it is nice that wifi is built in, and they have the same entry price as the pi, and they seem to be more focused on embedded solutions, with a lot of messaging around pricing and use for embedded. But no GPU on this chip which seems unfortunate, unless I am missing something. And no camera port, usb only. This might or might not be ok, tho part of the RPI’s appeal is the camera port dumping right to GPU ram with no use of the limited usb/io bus.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.spark.io/">Spark Electron</a> is another interesting device, built in low cost cellular plan, which is very nice. I am compelled to trial one just for that. Now this is a much more compute limited device than the others, but a great idea.</p>

Not a terrible addition to the Beatles literature, but not great either. The discussion of the lyrics is not very deep, which might be ok, but the discussion of what was going on with the writers at the time is also thin. Just OK.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/stonesfall.jpg"><img src="images/stonesfall-200x300.jpg" alt="stonesfall" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sisters-Brothers-Patrick-DeWitt-ebook/dp/B004CFA91Y">The Sisters Brothers</a> by Patrick deWitt. Fantastic Old West characters, I loved the two brothers. The tale started out strong and kind of petered out, but memorable characters.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wool-Trilogy-Hugh-Howey-ebook/dp/B0071XO8RA">Wool Omnibus Edition</a> by Hugh Howey. OK we don’t really need any more near future post apocalyptic dystopia novels, but this was fun.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stones-Fall-Iain-Pears-ebook/dp/B001NLL0JA">Stone’s Fall</a> by Iain Pears. Well this was twisty and fun. Deception and intrigue across several generations in the 1900s.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zoo-City-Lauren-Beukes-ebook/dp/B003ZSIT0M">Zoo City</a> by Lauren Beukes. Near future science fiction set in South Africa, not the usual setting for most books available here in US.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tanglewreck-Jeanette-Winterson-ebook/dp/B0055S2GT0">Tanglewreck</a> by Jeanette Winterson. Someone recommended this as a great YA title, but I thought it was a bit of a mess.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unseen-Will-Trent-Atlanta-Book-ebook/dp/B00AXIZ3HE">Unseen</a> by Karin Slaughter. How does this thing get good reviews on Amazon, it is a poorly written mess. Gave up on quickly.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Terror-Living-Urban-Waite-ebook/dp/B00495ZE3A">The Terror of Living</a> by Urban Waite. Smuggling on the Canadian border goes very very wrong.</li>
