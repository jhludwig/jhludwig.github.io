  <h1><a href="/2002/12/05/corporate-holiday-cards.html">Corporate Holiday Cards</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Corporate Holiday Cards.</strong> I am starting to receive holiday greeting cards from companies and business associates, as I do every year. I am sure my own firm will send some out. Call me cold and unfeeling, but I won’t be sending any out to business partners and associates.</p>

<p>I don?t personally feel a warm connection with a firm when I receive these ? I know that someone somewhere just had their admin machinery crank them out. The sincerity is not there. And it costs time and money that we could all put to better use. Occasionally I do get a very personal greeting that someone sends out, those are different and I respect those.</p>

<p>But if you are a business partner of mine, take this as your greeting, and know that instead of spending time and money sending out cards, I’ll be spending a little more time on business issues that matter, a little more time with loved ones, spending a little less money on expenses, and spending a little more helping out those who really need help this holiday season. Happy Holidays!</p>

The history of industry consortiums that have come together with the sole purpose of countering some Microsoft initiative is not good. I remember viewing these consortiums with amusement because the members were never truly aligned on goals, they just all wanted to join in a Microsoft hate-fest, and that never leads to a viable software product. And it just wastes the time and energy of these companies.</p>

    <p><strong>Karen Holbrook Letter.</strong> Received this week from Karen Holbrook, President of The Ohio State University:</p>

<p>_To our alumni and friends:</p>

<p>As a university community, we all congratulate our football team and coaches for their extraordinary season and Saturday’s tremendous victory. It is a remarkable accomplishment and they have made us very proud. We all left Ohio Stadium knowing that our Buckeyes had given their all to bring us to the verge of a national championship.</p>

<p>Sadly for all of us, the line between celebration and rampage was crossed Saturday night. I am certain that by now you have all seen the news accounts of the illegal and destructive behavior exhibited in the university area by a number of our students and fans. While some may say it was in response to our great victory, there is no way to draw any connection between the remarkable grace and poise of our team and the appalling actions that took place. To even try and make that connection is a gross insult to our coaches and our players.</p>

<p>Throughout Sunday, I met with members of the senior university administration and with Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman and members of his staff. Following our discussions, we invited members of the news media to meet with us and I released the statement below. The mayor shares my dismay and disappointment with what took place, and together we have agreed that we will vigorously pursue all legal sanctions – both criminally and through the university’s judicial process where students are identified. For the university, I have authorized Vice President for Student Affairs Bill Hall to use all means necessary to deal with this unacceptable behavior by members of our student body.</p>

<p>The majority of our students celebrated appropriately and in moderation. Many students took leadership roles in an attempt to ensure a safe celebration. Unfortunately, a minority chose to ruin for the rest of us what had been a joyful occasion. Rather than reveling in our opportunity to become national football champions, we are obligated to respond to the damage to our community, our reputation and our university.</p>

<p>This is a community problem, and its solution will require collective ideas, support and cooperation. In the days ahead, we must all give thought to how we address this situation, both immediately and for the long term.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Karen A. Holbrook President The Ohio State University</p>

<p>STATEMENT FROM OSU PRESIDENT KAREN A. HOLBROOK IN RESPONSE TO OFF-CAMPUS RIOTS, NOVEMBER 24, 2002</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, we witnessed all that’s great about intercollegiate athletics – a spirited, competitive football game that went right down to the last second. Last night, we witnessed the very worst in reaction to what had been a joyful occasion. The behavior was criminal and unacceptable. And unfortunately, many of those responsible appear to be our students.</p>

<p>First, allow me to apologize on behalf of The Ohio State University community for last night’s actions. I express apologies to our city, to those who suffered property damage, and to those fans and supporters who did celebrate in an appropriate manner.</p>

<p>Mayor Coleman and I have been speaking throughout the morning. In addition to expressing apologies, I commended the actions of our city police and firefighters, along with our university police and security personnel, for their effective and professional approach to dealing with these appalling circumstances. I also informed the mayor that the university will cooperate in every way possible with the police as they investigate this event. As in the past, those who were arrested will be immediately suspended from the university. Those who engaged in criminal activity will face expulsion. Earlier today, I authorized Ohio State’s vice president for student affairs, Bill Hall, to use all means necessary to identify and address those responsible.</p>

<p>To this end, we will review the television tape and other photographic evidence of last night’s events and identify as many of those as possible who were involved. We also ask that anyone, students or otherwise, who can help identify the participants in criminal and destructive behavior to come forward and do so by contacting Bill Hall, vice president for student affairs.</p>

<p>We have 49,000 students at our Columbus campus. The vast majority celebrated responsibly and in moderation. Some even took leadership roles in an attempt to ensure a safe celebration. It is embarrassing that the actions of others, exhibiting the worst behaviors, have blighted what was otherwise an exceptional day.</p>

<p>Finally, it is sad to note that last night’s behavior is not unique to Ohio State. There were similar events at other campuses in the hours following major games yesterday afternoon and evening. And indeed, this is a national and ongoing problem and regrettably has become an all too common characteristic of our society. What the ultimate answer might be, I am not certain. But, it is my view, that such behaviors must be addressed on many fronts by university presidents, parents, and by the students themselves._</p>

    <p><strong>Hunger at Thanksgiving</strong>. I heard from friends back in <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion,_Ohio">Marion</a> that 1000 free meals were served yesterday from just one church for the holiday. Multiply this by the number of active churches, organizations, shelters, etc, and that is a pretty phenomenal number of meals for a town with a population of 35,000, in a county with a population of 66,000.</p>

<p>It is saddening that so many people need help – but I am glad there are so many people back in Marion who are helping out.</p>

<p>When I stopped at <a href="http://www.qfconline.com/">QFC</a> this am, i bought one of their pre-packaged bags of groceries for the food bank. Something I intend to do every trip to the market from now on.</p>

    <p><strong>Tong is interested in Ensim Webppliance.</strong> Hey Rich I am willing to consider running <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/weblog/2002_11_01_archive.asp#85239717">Webppliance</a> but does that mean you intend to move some domains back to my server? And what are the key features you want? I guess you are not having fun supporting Michelle, Zagula, etc, and want to automate the pain away? (Also PS your link to ensim is busted in this post)</p>
