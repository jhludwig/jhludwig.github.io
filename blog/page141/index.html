				<p><p>Nice commentary on <a href="http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2005/Columnists/Fiu/COW/Cavalcade_of_Whimsy.htm">collegefootballnews.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Coaches can go from one team to another without having to sit out a year. Students can transfer from one college to another without any sort of a penalty. It’s time the repressive NCAA realizes how unfair it is to its employees, er, student-athletes and allow them to transfer as well if they choose to. If a player doesn’t like the school he’s at, he should be able to leave at any time without penalty. Go ahead, raid away. If a coach doesn’t like this idea, then he should make sure his school and program are good enough to keep the players. As far as the coaches of the “Katrina schools”, if you really care about your players, you’ll let them do what’s in their best interest, not yours. And to the NCAA, it is possible to make exceptions to the rules and use some actual judgment when it’s time to do the decent thing</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hypocrisy of the adults involved with college sports sickens me. Love the games, love the kids, but some of the adults, well…</p>

				<p><p>Dipped into the nonfiction pool recently:</p>

<p>* “Confessions of an Economic Hit Man”:amazon. OK I don’t doubt parts of the premise here – the developed nations of the western world use economics to influence and control happenings in the less developed countries. And when economics fail, they sometimes use other means. Duh. This is the way the world has worked approximately forever. I am not sure what he is blowing the whistle on. But Perkins is a blowhard. Puts himself in the middle of all the major happenings of the 20th century. Uses the word “I” all the time. Not much acknowledgement to any teams. It seems almost pathological, and the author drops hints about problems in his personal life, you get the sense he has a real pathology here. And he did this job he hates – extending the western world’s economic dominance over the rest of the world – for years and let himself be bought at every turn. Even when he showed signs of a conscience, he jumped back into the job with both arms, at one point claiming “if I didn’t do it, someone else would.” Wow now that is a standup guy. You get the sense he wrote this book now for fame or money or both, not out of some real sense of altruism.</p>

<p>* “The New Normal”:amazon. Here I thought this was a business book, given the author. But really it is a self help book (I haven’t dipped into this genre since <a href="http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=36&amp;ti=26,36&amp;Search_Arg=dyer%2C+wayne&amp;Search_Code=NAME_&amp;PID=7605&amp;CNT=25&amp;HC=39&amp;SEQ=20050919161222&amp;SID=2">Wayne Dyer burst on the market in the 70s</a>). A lot of economic observations but really this is all about taking control of your life. Roger articulates pretty well how technology is giving us even more control, and how your government/employer safety nets are decaying even more (largely out of their control). And how you can and should take the opportunity to grab control of your own life. Great stuff, young people should read this book or something like it. Hat tip to <a href="http://www.ackerley.com/about.htm">chris</a> for the book.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">16 September 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK this is the most boring weekend of big 10 football in recent history. The <a href="http://bigten.collegesports.com/sports/m-footbl/big10-m-footbl-body.html">Big 10 itself says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>With eight unbeaten teams and a non-conference record of 18-3, the Big Ten is off to its best start in the last decade.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But boy I beg to differ. With the Iowa, Michigan, and OSU losses last week, the blush is off this rose. And look at some of these stunning matchups this weekend:</p>

<p>* Eastern Michigan at Michigan * Northern Iowa at Iowa * San Diego State at Ohio State * Central Michigan at Penn State * Florida Atlantic at Minnesota</p>

<p>And then there is the that classic: Kentucky at Indiana. Do these states even know what a football looks like? and just no buzz at all around Illinois at Cal and Wisconsin at North Carolina.</p>

<p>The only stories at all this weekend are:</p>

<p>* Purdue’s first real game with a visit to Arizona. A terrible letdown for Purdue if they can’t win this. * Michigan State at ND. Can ND continue to show up strong?</p>

<p>Pretty thin gruel.</p>
</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/why-osu-lost">Why OSU lost</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">12 September 2005</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK, why did OSU lose to Texas, and why did Texas win?</p>

<p>At a first glance, <a href="http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2005/Columnists/MZ/Week2/IA_Texas_OhioState.htm">Vince Young was the man</a>. He came through early, and he came through late. Along the way he took a beating and still hung in there.</p>

<p>But OSU had many many chances to put this game away – 5 good field goals, 6 attempts. The offense wasn’t a disaster, but it was ultimately not productive enough. The defense and special teams gave the offense the ball in great position all night long, but the offense couldn’t get it in the endzone.</p>

<p>Why? <a href="http://www.bucyrustelegraphforum.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050912/SPORTS/509120313/1006">You can point to Hamby’s bobble of a TD pass in the endzone, you can point to the field goal missed by feet.</a> But these were single plays over the course of a whole game.</p>

<p>The consistent theme was lack of ball movement by the offense. The QBs weren’t bad, although <a href="http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/football/cs-0509120231sep12,1,170147.story?coll=cs-college-print">some feel that settling on one would make a difference</a>. The running game was adequate.</p>

<p>The real problem was failure to make use of the speed of Ted Ginn Jr. and Santonio Holmes. These guys showed on return plays that, when they have a few steps of open field, they can kill a team. But the offense rarely got them the ball with any kind of open field. Invariably they were catching the ball as they were going out of bounds or with a defender’s arms around them. As the <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/football/football.php?story=dispatch/2005/09/12/20050912-D4-01.html">Dispatch says</a>(subscription):</p>

<p>bq. <em>“Rather than worry about how to tackle the elusive Ginn once he had the ball, the Texas defense assigned one or two players to cover him on every down, denying him easy catches and <strong>making him run routes, which he doesn’t do that well.</strong>“</em></p>

<p>To be a great team, OSU needs to figure out how to use the speed of these players. Perhaps the staff needs better plays, perhaps a single QB needs time to settle into the game, but the speed receivers need to get themselves into positions to make big plays.</p>
