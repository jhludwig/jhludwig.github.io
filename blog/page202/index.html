				<p><p>I need a cheap longdistance solution for calls within the US. The calling location is deep inside a building at <a href="http://www.pomona.edu">Pomona College</a> and cell coverage sucks.</p>

<p>Option A is prepaid cards. Genuine ATT cards are availabe on <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?query=at%26t+phone+cards&amp;ht=1&amp;sosortproperty=1&amp;from=R10&amp;BasicSearch=">ebay</a> for about 3.4 cents per minute. Or you can go even cheaper if you go to a site like <a href="http://www.callingcardplus.com">CallingCardPlus</a> -- rates down to .5 cents per minute. I am sure quality on some of these cheap plans is iffy.</p>

<p>The location does have 10mbit ethernet and so VOIP is an option – I wonder what will happen when every student starts using VOIP, I bet the campus net is not engineered for that case. <a href="http://www.pulver.com/fwd/" title="Free World Dialup - by pulver.com">Free World Dialup - by pulver.com</a> is a way to start, seems pretty geeky tho, you have to be a NAT expert – OK for me but not sure this will work for the caller. I wonder if <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> is any easier to use. I definitely want an option that uses a SIP phone or a regular phone, I don’t want to use a PC mic and headphones.</p>

Poor sportsmanship – a lot of unnecessary personal fouls, Tressel should have sat Will Smith the rest of the game for some of the fouls he committed. The line was pushed around aby SDSU. SDSU had a good game plan with delays and traps and draws, OSU looked confused and outhit. Krenzel was incredibly ineffective. Way off on passes, especially anything longer than 10 yards. The running game was weak.</p>

<p>The defense finally stood up and saved the day, forcing turnovers and bottling up SDSU. The offense never did show up – no one on offense should earn a leaf for their helments this week.</p>

<p>Were the buckeyes looked ahead to NC State? Not as much as NC State was looking ahead to the Buckeyes, as NC State dropped their game to Wake Forest.</p>

<p>Let’s hope Tressel and the team use this to motivate themselves for next week.</p>

I knew little about the service academies before reading this book, it is a fascinating read. At times I was impressed with West Point; the values that they try to embed in their students are very admirable. At other moments I worried about the end product, as the students seem to be dehumanized and in some ways lose respect for the rest of citizens of their nation. But a great read, very enjoyable, very engaging as it follows the careers and choices of a set of students.</p>
