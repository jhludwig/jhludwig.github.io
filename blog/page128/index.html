				<p><p>I’ve been on a modern mystery/suspense jag:</p>

<p>* “Ten Second Staircase”:amazon by Christopher Fowler. Very inventive and engaging mystery. 3rd in a series featuring a pair of superannuated london detctives working on bizarre crimes. A lot of fun, I’d pick up more in the series. Though good luck finding anything by Fowler in any of the big chains, they just don’t carry much by him. Pity. * “13 Steps Down”:amazon by Ruth Rendell. Twisted little tale of obsession and murder. Nicely crafted tho hard to really connect with the book as the main characters are not very sympathetic. Still, much better fare than most mysteries. * “The Hard Way”:amazon by Lee Child. Another great romp featuring jack reacher. These books feel like graphic novels written as prose – reacher is a classic modern day anti-hero – emotionally scarred, seemingly indestructible. A lot of fun. * “The Janissary Tree”:amazon by Jason Goodwin. My favorite of the bunch. I’ve never had a hankering to visit Istanbul, but after reading this period mystery I am ready to go, and I am ready to read goodwin’s historical work on the ottoman empire. A great setting, great main character, good supporting cast. Definitely recommended.</p>

				<p><p>OK our first 360 bit the dust. locks up 1 minute after booting. 7 months into owning it – just out of the warranty phase. so $129 to get it fixed – this must be the microsoft strategy for making money, $129 every six months…</p>

<p>I considered buying a new one at the msft company store but they don’t seem to have them, and i am not sure the discount would be anything special.</p>

<p>the real pain is the amount of time to get it fixed. they are shipping us a mailing box, it will take 3-5 business days to arrive. then another 3-5 to return to them. then 3-5 to fix and 3-5 to get back. so a month gone. during summer vacation high season. not good.</p>

				<p><p>So much to read on virtualization these days – here’s a nice blog – <a href="http://www.virtualization.info/" title="virtualization.info">virtualization.info</a>.</p>

<p>Put me to wondering – what if it were free to bring up VMs on your machine? Where “free” means very inexpensive in performance terms.</p>

<p>I wonder if we wouldn’t architect our OSes very differently. Why jam all the advanced support for graphics hardware, and the attendant instability, into mainstream Windows? My web browser and mail client just don’t benefit from it. Wouldn’t I rather just bring up a separate VM that has all my xbox-like features and nothing else?</p>

<p>I really wonder if in the face of cheap virtualization, you wouldn’t design OSes very differently. Rather than having a general purpose OS with all the features needed for every class of app, perhaps you would instead design for very special purpose VMs with a smaller set of OS features – this VM profile for games, that one for productivity apps, another for running all your firewalling and security goo, etc etc.</p>

				<p><p>Looking at some cars to add to the household – the sweet spot is the $32K sedan.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.volvocars.us/models/s60/" title="Volvo S60">Volvo S60</a>, <a href="http://www.subaru.com/shop/model_consideration.jsp?model=LEGACY">Subaru Legacy</a>, and <a href="http://www.vw.com/passat/index.html">vw passat</a> all seem like great choices. Good interior styling, good safety, good handling and performance. And all seem like good values, you get a lot for your dollar.</p>

<p>We wanted to like the <a href="http://www.toyota.com/avalon/index.html">Toyota Avalon</a> but the handling just wasn’t there – this thing wallows thru the turns. Styling and features are decent but not handling. We wanted to like the <a href="http://www.chrysler.com/300/">Chrysler 300</a> also and it handles nicely, has a great powertrain, and looks good on the outside, but the interior styling and fit-and-finish are 10 years behind.</p>

<p>And the <a href="http://www.cadillac.com/cadillacjsp/model/gallery.jsp?model=cts">Cadillac CTS</a> – what an embarrassment. A salesperson who hasn’t heard yet that Cadillac no longer is the pacesetter; overpriced, and underfeatured. I would feel stupid buying this car.</p>
