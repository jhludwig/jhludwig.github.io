<blockquote>
  <p><em>The novel that means most to men is about indifference, alienation and lack of emotional responses. That which means most to women is about deeply held feelings, a struggle to overcome circumstances and passion, research by the University of London has found.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Men’s reading choices tend to identify themselves with novels that include intellectual struggle. Personal vulnerability is represented as a more or less angst-ridden struggle against convention, a sense of isolation from social normality.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Part of the reason for this, we decided, was that, to a far larger degree than women, men’s formative reading was done between the ages of 12 and 20 - indeed, specifically around the ages of 15 and 16. For men, fiction was a rite of passage into manhood during painful adolescence.</em></p>

Personally I sailed through the first 6 weeks and easily made it into the tiebreaker round. But today’s tiebreaker puzzle crushed me. I knew there was a nonstandard trick involved, but I didn’t figure it out in any kind of reasonable time. Hat tip to the mystery winner who may have just made a lucky guess at the right answer – if I had smartly applied game theory to today’s tiebreaker, I would have called in with an educated guess as well. I know that I am nowhere near the crossword solver that some of the participants are, my only chance to win would have been to make an educated guess. Someone did that and won, smart thinking.</p>

  <li>“Mr Midshipman Hornblower”:amazon by C. S. Forester. What a great yarn. And the first of a series of ten or so books. If you’ve exhausted all the current popular serial fantasy (Potter, Tolkein, Narnia, etc) and you need to branch out, this would be a fine series to read. Great for young male readers. Not so good maybe for young women – as a product of its times and its genre, there are few female characters of note.</li>
  <li>“I, Claudius”:amazon by Robert Graves. History comes alive! Impressive work of story telling and of scholarship. Makes roman history fascinating.</li>
  <li>“Holmes on the Range”:amazon by Steve Hockensmith. The “deducifyin’” of Holmes, as practiced by a cowhand in the historical american west. The author creates a very interesting set of brothers and does a nice job keeping in voice throughout the story.</li>
