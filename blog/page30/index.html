  <h1><a href="/2009/11/09/matlab-lessons.html">MATLAB lessons</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Doing a ton of MATLAB coding these days. What an amazing tool. For a numbers geek, this is so much better than Excel. The macro language in excel/spreadsheets has always been wacky, and the basic tool in later versions is even worse.</p>

<p>MATLAB is awesome but of course some key lessons that I am relearning, as well as some new ones.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Off-by-one errors are killers. Especially when dealing with huge complex matrices. Document and layout your variables carefully.</li>
  <li>The lack of any variable typing system is a little scary, as well as the lack of required variable declarations. You can get in a lot of trouble easily by declaring variables willy-nilly and doing whatever you want with them. Powerful but a little dangerous.</li>
  <li>OK, the ability to create variables with the same name as built-in values/functions, and/or the ability to assign values to built-ins without regard to their intended value – well this is just nutso.  And the “lint” tool that is part of the development environment doesn’t make a peep about it. For instance, I used “i” as the index value for a loop. Unfortunately “i” means of course the square root of -1, and when you arbitrarily set this to say 5, bad $h!t happens. Who ever thought it was a good idea to let users do this? Lesson learned.</li>
  <li>MATLAB is very PL/1 like. OK this doesn’t mean much to most people, but there is a function or library for everything in MATLAB. If it is something you want to do, there is probably already a function or option to do it, you just have to sift thru the function reference to find it.</li>
  <li>BTW, make sure you change the help search options to span just the libs you have access to. Otherwise everytime you search help, you will get 95% useless information.</li>
  <li>The lack of even the most primitive source control package in the development environment is ridiculous. It is easy to point the tool at other working directories tho. Short of installing a source control system , clone your working directory often. Really there ought to be some simple versioning in the tool and the ability to rollback.</li>
</ul>

    <p>I could take the high road here and talk about the great character of the Ohio State team or the great athleticism they displayed…</p>

<p>…but it is way more fun to enjoy the misery of the PSU crowd –</p>

<ul>
  <li>teeth gnashing over at <a href="http://www.blackshoediaries.com/2009/11/8/1121355/and-here-come-the-pretzels">Black Shoe Diaries</a> – “Sifting through the rubble this morning, and nothing has changed. Yesterday’s game was an absolute owning of the home team – coaches, players, fans, offense, defense, special teams – from beginning to end.”</li>
  <li>declaring the season a total loss over at <a href="http://www.centredaily.com/sports/colleges/penn_state/football/story/1614802.html">CentreDaily</a> – “It probably took Ohio State’s Cameron Heyward, who had both Buckeye sacks, an extra 15 minutes in the showers to wash off the chunks of Clark left on his body from Saturday’s game.”</li>
</ul>

<p>This victory and our enjoyment of it will sow years of hatred for OSU in the PSU fanbase, which is of course one of the great things about college football.</p>

    <p>Been a slow slow blogging fall. Killing myself on two courses at UW, and a bunch of other stuff. But have been on airplanes enough to work my way through some modest tomes:</p>

<p>* “Await Your Reply”:amazon by Dan Choan. Strange tale of a serial ID thief trying to find a life for himself. Along the way he spawns more and more ID thieves, all of whom experience the freedom of creating themselves out of whole cloth. An interesting tale couched as a mystery but really a more thoughtful inspection of identity. Amazon says 4 stars, I would agree, this book has stuck with me a little. * “Fidelity”:amazon by Thomas Perry. Quality thriller. A PI is murdered, and his wife and colleagues dig into his life and his lies to understand the cause. Amazon says 3 stars. I guess that is about right, I honestly can’t remember much of the tale now. It was fine and won’t hurt your brain but accept it for what it is, an airplane read. * “In Pale Battalions”:amazon by Robert Goddard. A woman gradually discovers the truths about her family and background – the cruelty and crimes during WWI which defined her life. Unexpected and good. 4.5 stars on Amazon, this is a very engaging tale of family secrets.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/10/21/matlab-on-osx-pay-attention-to-file-names.html">Matlab on OSX -- pay attention to file names</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>BTW, this is a powerful but incredibly finicky piece of software. It is an X11 app, and I wonder how much that is affecting it.</p>

<p>One thing to watch for is the path length limitation on the names of m files. it is 63 characters total for the full path – that is right, the FULL path. the full path by default is some long path pointing into a MATLAB directory in your documents folder, in my case, 52 characters were already used up. So when i put a nice long name on an M file, I exceeded the 63 limit and got some completely nonsense error message about the file not being on my path. Well ok the error message was true, the truncated filename file wasn’t on any path anywhere, but stupid.</p>

<p>The other thing I’ve noticed is that Matlab really doesn’t like m files whose names begin with a number – ie it just will not run something called “55.m”. you need to start with alpha.</p>

<p>Silly. It’s 2009 guys. These feel like MSDOS restrictions circa 1990.</p>

    <p>Some silence in last month. Spent a lot of time enjoying family and central <a href="http://theludwigs.com/tag/ohio/">Ohio</a>, fall is the time to be in the state with football, color changes, often good weather, etc.</p>

<p>And when not in Ohio, I was in Helsinki (recommended: <a href="http://www.palacekamp.fi/in_english/hotels/hotel_glo/">Hotel Glo</a>, <a href="http://www.fazergroup.com/templates/Fazer_DivisionStartPage.aspx?id=32829&amp;epslanguage=FI">Fazer Cafe</a>), Stockholm (<a href="http://www.lydmar.com/">Lydmar Hotel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_Museum">Vasa Museum</a>, Sture shopping area, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skogskyrkog%C3%A5rden">Skogskyrkogården</a>, Sodermalm, <a href="http://www.fasching.se/">Fasching Jazz Club</a>, Opera Bar, oh and much more), and Brussels (<a href="http://www.hotelamigo.com/">Hotel Amigo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Michael_and_St._Gudula_Cathedral">St Michael/St Gudula Cathedral</a>, Roue d’Or, <a href="http://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/Portail/Site/Typo3.asp?lang=FR&amp;id=languagedetect">Musee Magritte</a>, Comic Museum, Sablon, <a href="http://www.wittamer.com/fr/index.php">Wittamer chocolates</a>, and much more).</p>

<p>Mentally I’ve been thinking about <a href="http://www.fatspaniel.com/fat-spaniel-blog/us-department-of-energy%E2%80%99s-solar-decathlon-2009/">Fat Spaniel</a>, a couple new things, and my half time load at UW this term as I continue my education. Lots of differential equations theory and numerical analysis, stuff I touched on 25 years ago, but good to get the base refreshed. Amazing how the tools have changed – MatLab and Mathematica are just incredible pieces of software.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/09/26/books-the-unforgiving-minute-a-big-little-life.html">Books -- The Unforgiving Minute, A Big Little Life</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “The Unforgiving Minute”:amazon by Craig M. Mullaney. Subtitled “A Soldier’s Education”, the story of the author’s travels through West Point, Oxford, Ranger and Infantry training, Afghanistan, and post-Afghanistan. No amount of physical training, education, reflection, or preparation prepares you for the reality of combat and it’s lingering effects. A little overwritten at times but interesting nonetheless. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I’d say 4. * “A Big Little Life”:amazon by Dean Koontz. Sweet book about his dog and the deep impact she had on his life, an unexpected piece of work from Koontz. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I ‘m not sure any book in this genre can really be 4.5 stars, but this is heartwarming and won’t hurt you.</p>

<p>Might be last book postings for a while. Fall course load will displace pleasure reading.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/09/23/books-julian-comstock-the-manual-of-detection-fear-the-worst.html">Books -- Julian Comstock, The Manual of Detection, Fear The Worst</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “Julian Comstock: A Story of 22nd-Century America” by Robert Charles Wilson. Excellent tale of post-apocolyptic America. Classic tragedy themes – the rise of an idealist to power, and his fall driven by his excessive actions in service of his ideals. All narrated by a friend in a folksy Twainish style. Very engaging. Amazon says 3.5 stars, I might nudge a little higher. * “The Manual of Detection”:amazon by Jedediah Barry. A clerk in a detective agency gets pulled into a conspiracy of murder and power. Oh and the boundary between dreams and reality is completely porous so this is a pretty odd read. The ending is all too neat for a premise this strange. Amazon says 4 stars, I don’t know. Some people will love this book, some will hate it. * “Fear The Worst”:amazon by Linwood Barclay. A straight-ahead mystery adventure, which was nice after the book above. A man’s daughter disappears and he gets caught up in murders and conspiracies and lies. A little too parsimonious with characters as the author makes nearly every acquaintance of the protagonist a member of the conspiracy. 4 stars on Amazon, yeah sure, tho this is brain candy and won’t stick with you. * “The Snakehead”:amazon by Patrick Radden Keefe. Nonfiction, the story of the human smuggling trade from China to the US in the 80s/90s/early 2000s. A little dated but a great story, man the money involved was phenomenal. 4 stars on amazon, I’d agree.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/09/22/more-great-things-about-central-ohio-part-4.html">More Great Things about Central Ohio -- Part 4</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “Pink Moon Cupcake Bakery”:http://www.pinkmooncupcakes.com/. My sister turned me on to this one, I never would have found the place otherwise. Awesome cupcakes in a quaint old town. * Lawns. My gosh do people love their lawns here. Even modest houses have gigantic expanses of grass, all lovingly tended. People spend half their weekend mowing. And the mowers! These things are nearly RV-sized. In Seattle, lawns are often an afterthought, and sometimes nonexistent – grass just doesn’t do as well in the climate. * The Ohio State University Hospital. We had an appointment there this week, the staff were unfailingly polite, honestly a better experience than that at the many other facilities we have visited.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2009/09/21/i-dont-get-the-usc-community-analysis-of-the-uw-loss.html">I don&#039;t get the USC community analysis of the UW loss</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Here’s a typical blog posting from the “USC community”:http://www.conquestchronicles.com/2009/9/20/1045207/play-calling-is-overrated. Whacking on Corp for Saturday’s loss. All the blogs repeat this theme as do the press like the OC Register. And I saw quotes from Pete basically throwing Corp under the bus.</p>

<p>Seems to me tho that “Corp was no better or worse than Barkley before him”:http://www.conquestchronicles.com/2009/9/20/1045089/comparisons-between-barkley-and. When you change QBs and results are the same, perhaps it is the other variables – receivers or coaching. And as I watched the game, the poor ball handling by Havili and McKnight, who both gave up unforced fumbles to kill scoring drives, seemed like the greater issue.</p>

<p>Of course as a Buckeye fan, this all just reaggravates the wound.</p>
