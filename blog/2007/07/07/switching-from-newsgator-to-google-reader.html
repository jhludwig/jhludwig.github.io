<p>I’m switching from <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/subscriber/reader/index.aspx">newsgator</a> to <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/" title="Google Reader (4)">Google Reader (4)</a> for rss reading. I’ve been a longtime user of newsgator and loved it, especially the outlook integration. But I find myself spending less and less time in Outlook and more and more using the web version, and the newsgator web version is just too slow, and tends to block in firefox frequently. The google reader isn’t perfect but is a lot zippier.</p>
