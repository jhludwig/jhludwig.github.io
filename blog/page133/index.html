				<p><p>OK now that I am off the high of the Michigan game, what’s next? Let’s assume enough of the BCS top 6 win out, ie there is no way for The OSU to jump to the #2 position. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/stewart_mandel/11/21/bowl.projections/index.html">Si.COM says OSU will get left out of the BCS mix, pushed out by Oregon and ND</a> – the claim being that the Fiesta Bowl holds all the cards and that they may be tired of The OSU.</p>

<p>After a <a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org/index2.cfm?page=eligibility">careful reading of the BCS selection rules</a>, I don’t get it. The Fiesta loses Texas to the Rose and so they get first pick to replace. They can pick any BCS eligible team. I think the game is all about avoiding WVU as they are the worst TV draw. So the Fiesta can pick Penn State as their first team. Then they have to list 3 choices for their second team, and WVU as a conf champ has to be at least their #2 pick. And the Orange wins tiebreakers, so assuming both the Orange and the Fiesta choose ND as their first choice, the Fiesta gets WVU (or even worse, USF!!).</p>

<p>Alternatively, the Fiesta could pick ND as their first team, and then they have to list Penn State and WVU as their top two choices in their list of three. Again they lose the tiebreaker to the Orange and end up with WVU.</p>

<p>Either way it seems like the Sugar ends up with the last choice and (assuming The OSU falls this far) will get to pick between The OSU or Oregon. And it has been a while since The OSU has been to the Sugar.</p>

I have 60gig of music, and a lot from compilation discs, so I end up with a kabillion artist folders in my music folder. And foldershare barfs on it. It does work fine for my photos folder. But the limit is arbitrary and makes the software useless for me. I am also wondering about the lag in syncing – it looks like it is going to take 24+ hours to sync my 3000 photos across 2 machines, I wonder why so slow.

  <li><em>The one that trips people out is the year Ohio State won the National Championship you can see their crowd in Tempe and read lips as they pan the crowd following the game people are yelling “Fuck Michigan!” Like we have any relevance at that point, that’s how much they care about us.</em> You have to understand, “F M” is a good sentiment for any occasion.</li>

				<p><p>OK you don’t need another sweatshirt or t-shirt. You have 7 varieties of caps. You have the windbreaker. The flag. The posters, the books. The marching band records. The foam finger. A Brutus costume. The “Muck Fichigan” pin. So what do you need? Some fine ideas from the alumni mag:</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://www.fossil.com/buckeyes">Fossil watch</a>. Ok not that exotic. * The <a href="http://www.buckeyeblazer.com">scarlet or gray blazer</a>. Always in fashion. * The <a href="http://www.thepopcornfactory.com/Ohio05">popcorn tin</a>. (Hey Marion, how did you let this business slip to some company in Virginia? Marion is the popcorn capital of the world!) * The <a href="http://www.littlebandman.com">marching band miniatures</a>. * Not one, but two varieties of Buckeye Coffee – <a href="http://www.varsityblends.com/ohiostate">Ohio State Varsity Blends</a> or <a href="http://www.drinkstorm.com">Drinkstorm</a>. Particularly apropo for Seattle area residents like me. * Coffee cups and other pottery at <a href="http://www.hartstonepottery.com">Hartstone Pottery</a> * A <a href="http://www.tru-fan.com">buckeye carpet</a>. This would look great in the living room. * A <a href="http://www.sportswoodfurniture.com">buckeye park bench</a>. And here is your living room furniture. * And <a href="http://www.gamedaymurals.com">a mural for the wall</a> – won’t they wonder about our civilization 1000 years from now when they dig this up. * <a href="http://www.buckeyecrunch.com">Buckeye Crunch cereal</a> – the breakfast of true champions. * Or a trip to an exotic part of the world with a group of alums – <a href="http://www.ohiostatealumni.org/tours">Alumni Tours</a>. Nothing says buckeye pride like a trip down the Nile.</p>

<p>Enjoy! And I will accept any and all of these for the holidays.</p>

				<p><p>Not much reading in the last month due to Halloween. But I got a couple in:</p>

<p>* “Olympus by Dan Simmons”:amazon. Probably more enjoyable if you know greek myth and shakespeare inside and out. An ok tale. Still wishing that Dan would produce something like “Hyperion”:amazon again – the Shrike is one of the greatest beings in science fiction. * “Hot Property by Pat Choate”:amazon. Good retrospective of IP systems. I was uninformed about the large differences in patent systems across different countries, and how the patent systems in other lands are not designed to protect inventors as much as they are designed to further industrial policy. Made me a stronger supporter of ip protection. Not sure how I really feel about the nationalistic tone in the book, I’d like to see a more global view of IP policy.</p>
