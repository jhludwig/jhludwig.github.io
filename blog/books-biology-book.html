	<title>Recent Books -- Biology Book, Fluent Forever, The Passage, Pathogenesis, Think Again – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="
  The Biology Book by Michael C. Gerald and Gloria E. Gerald.  A very approachable walk thru the 250 biggest milestones in biology.
  Fluent Forever by Gabriel Wyner.  This is a great plainly written guide on learning languages, but has been a little overtaken by the explosion of learning tools and apps.
  The Passage by Justin Cronin.  A post-apocalyptic vampire-zombie story.  Quite long but I was driven to read it through.  I’d like to read the rest but gosh they are long books.
  Pathogenesis by Jonathan Kennedy.  How history has been affected by pathogens – I knew some of this story, and books like Guns, Germs, and Steel have covered some of this territory, but there were some new things for me in here – I didn’t understand how malaria and yellow fever resistence helped drive the slave trade.
  Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know by Adam Grant.  I want to like this book.  There is a powerful message in here.  But the author’s continued use of misdirection and reveals is just kind of annoying, almost feels disrespectful to the reader.  I don’t think he had ill intent but it was offputting for me.
