	<title>Recent Books -- Parasite, Ice Harvest, Crace, Fowler, Mr Peanut, Byatt, Auchincloss – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="
  Parasite by Mira Grant. The start of a new series by the author of the Feed series, which I found to be among the best of the zombie novels I read. This is also a lot of fun, a twist on zombies, in some way much creepier. Looking forward to rest of series.
  The Ice Harvest by Scott Phillips. A Fargo-esque spiral of crime and misdeeds. Fun.
  Harvest by Jim Crace. Crace does not write happy tales. This story details the collapse of an insular farming village in the face of political and economic change, and how one man in the village experiences the changes. Kind of grabbed me tho it is a mostly depressing little tale.
  We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves by Karen Joy Fowler. Gripping. A woman tells the story of the unusual family tragedy that occurred at age 5, and how that has rippled through her life and her family’s life. Very hard to put down, and the messages will sit with me a long time.
  Mr. Peanut by Adam Ross. Three intertwined marriages beset by problems and power struggles, with some Hitchcockian murder built in, or maybe not, and with a mix of fiction and maybe truth. A lot going on here. And a lot of pain. Not sure how I feel about.
  Possession by A.S. Byatt. Snore. I need to remember that Man-Booker Prize != interesting.
  The Rector of Justin by Louis Auchincloss. A charismatic school founder and his impact on all the lives of the people around him, both good and bad. The power and charisma of a founder/leader can lift some people up and drown others. Really excellent tale and relevant in many walks of life.
