				<p><p>* “What’s My Name, Fool?”:amazon is a great collection of writings on sports by Dave Zirin. Zirin writes about the dirty underside of sports – the exploitation of poor uneducated young athletes; racism, sexism, and homophobia; the exploitation of sports by media and by politicians; the grotesque amounts of public monies spent on professional sports. Great great stuff. The histories of Ali, Jackie Robinson, Curt Flood, and others who fought for reform and for justice are illuminating. A very worthy read. * “Cheaper by the Dozen”:amazon – What a wonderful book. The father is an amazing character, the stories are fabulous. A very bittersweet ending, but that serves to make the story more human and authentic. Don’t know how I missed this growing up. * “The Ginger Man”:amazon by J P Donleavy – Horrid. Couldn’t finish. Brutish character, I learned nothing from him. The “Nicholas Baker”:amazon of 40 years ago – horrid little story that doesn’t need to be told. * “Gravity’s Rainbow”:amazon – A lot of interesting references and construction. But ultimately I didn’t care about anything happening in the book and put it down after 100 pages. If you want a farcical wartime book, read Catch-22. * “Keeping Watch”:amazon and “Folly”:amazon by Laurie R King. Wow, great pageturners. Great mysteries, great twists (especially keeping watch), really great characters who you care about. I like these much better than her period mysteries.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">14 August 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Just back from Lopez, great time. Some tips on hiking up there:</p>

<p>Stop by the chamber of commerce office in the village. Get their list of hikes and current directions – it is quite accurate. Many hikes on the island are on DNR land, accessible only by easement over private property – it can be a little tricky. The Chamber of Commerce directions are great.</p>

<p>The best hikes in my view:</p>

<p>* Shark reef. Short. But nice coastline and sealions. Very busy. * Otis Perkins Park. Go at low tide. A long expanse of beach. Probably safe to ignore private property signs. * Chadwick hill. Definitely need those instructions, accessing the trail head is tricky. No one goes here – Trail is rough, rough. But more vertical than most the trails on the island * Iceberg point. Again you need those instructions, tricky to find the trail. Not strenuous but a gorgeous piece of property, sealions, great views, some vertical gain. Lots of sun. This is the best on the island.</p>

				<p><p>* “Crossworld”:amazon by marc romano is a dive into the world of crosswords – the people in the “industry”, their motivations, marc’s own motivations. I am a compulsive crossworder and I got something out of this book – a little bit of background on leading characters. But marc spends too much time discussing and rationalizing his own interest in crosswords, and not enough diving into the stories, behaviours, and anecdotes of others in the industry. It reads as if he did a modest amount of research, had enough material for a long essay, and then bloated it up with a lot of navel gazing. So some value in the book but not a homerun. * “One shot”:amazon by Lee Child is a classic airport book rack thriller. A lone wolf ex-military investigator uncovers and breaks up a massive criminal conspiracy thanks to his unbelievable physical skills and powers of detection. He is three steps ahead of everyone else in the story and just seems to be toying with them. This is not a unique plot, half the thrillers on the airport book stands could be summed up the same way. This story has very nice pacing, an interesting situation, and is better than most. It’d make a great movie script. * “California girl”:amazon by T. Jefferson Parker is a great mystery. Deep characters with deeply intertwined lives. A stark contrast with the prior book – California Girl is a memorable story with memorable characters that altogether makes a great book, but way too complex to ever be a movie. One Shot is an adequately entertaining book but would be a killer summer movie.</p>

				<!-- <p><p>* Installed <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=61">Newsgator Outlook edition 2.5</a>. Seems faster and less resource consumptive. * As <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg3/TheDailyGrind669.html">Mike</a> says, <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/autoruns.html">Autoruns</a> is a great tool, essential for monitoring what’s on your system, amazing it is free. Mike also points to <a href="http://www.warecase.com/">XTM</a>, a replacement for windows task manager, might be useful. * <a href="http://getoutfoxed.com/">Getoutfoxed</a> – one feature of this I love is the ability to enumerate and rate your running processes, and share this info with the community. A great way to do grass roots virus/spyware identification, not unlike the ideas behind <a href="http://www.cloudmark.com">Cloudmark</a> * <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/07/15.html">Fog Creek Copilot</a>. Seems like a good feature to have as part of a future version of <a href="http://www.networkmagic.com/">NetworkMagic</a> * Rick Eames gave me this great tip <a href="http://www.bombich.com/mactips/automount.html">on how to automount network drives on my mac</a> – amazingly arcane. * <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/firefox/">Google toolbar for Firefox</a>, finally. * <a href="http://www.tipmonkies.com/">Tipmonkies</a>, lots of good software tidbits. Subscribed. * <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToRunADiskScanchkdskfsckAndTroubleshootYourIPod.aspx">How to chkdsk your ipod</a> – great tip * MSH (nee Monad) continues to intrique me – <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/06/monad_and_rss_p_1.html">Monad and RSS</a>, <a href="http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/MSHAndYubNubACommunityCommandline.aspx">Monad and Yubnub</a>. Ihaven’t had time to really play around with this as much as I should * Oh and speaking of yubnub, <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/07/yubnub-goes-mobile.html">Phil adds yubnub support to berry411</a>. Brilliant. * Looking forward to <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Blog_Software_Fights_Comment_Spam/1121456004">MT 3.2</a>. Also might try some tagging plugins when I upgrade – <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4148">MT tags plugin</a>, <a href="http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/001154technorati_tags_and_movable_type.php">MT and technorati</a></p>
