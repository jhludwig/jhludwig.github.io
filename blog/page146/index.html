				<p><p>* “Crossworld”:amazon by marc romano is a dive into the world of crosswords – the people in the “industry”, their motivations, marc’s own motivations. I am a compulsive crossworder and I got something out of this book – a little bit of background on leading characters. But marc spends too much time discussing and rationalizing his own interest in crosswords, and not enough diving into the stories, behaviours, and anecdotes of others in the industry. It reads as if he did a modest amount of research, had enough material for a long essay, and then bloated it up with a lot of navel gazing. So some value in the book but not a homerun. * “One shot”:amazon by Lee Child is a classic airport book rack thriller. A lone wolf ex-military investigator uncovers and breaks up a massive criminal conspiracy thanks to his unbelievable physical skills and powers of detection. He is three steps ahead of everyone else in the story and just seems to be toying with them. This is not a unique plot, half the thrillers on the airport book stands could be summed up the same way. This story has very nice pacing, an interesting situation, and is better than most. It’d make a great movie script. * “California girl”:amazon by T. Jefferson Parker is a great mystery. Deep characters with deeply intertwined lives. A stark contrast with the prior book – California Girl is a memorable story with memorable characters that altogether makes a great book, but way too complex to ever be a movie. One Shot is an adequately entertaining book but would be a killer summer movie.</p>

				<p><p>Per the pros, <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005313.php">the Buckeyes have 7-1 odds of being the national champs</a>, behind only USC.</p>

<p>OK I love the Buckeyes, but their line play was not all that strong last season, <a href="http://www.collegefootballnews.com/Big_Ten/2005_Previews/2005_BigTen_Unitrankings.htm">and per at least one ranking</a>, they are not as strong as several of the other contenders in the Big10 this year. On either side of the line.</p>

<p>I have a hard time believing that the relative lack of line strength will result in the top finish in the Big 10, let alone the BCS.</p>

				<p><p>* “Once An Eagle by Anton Myrer”:amazon. Had this on the shelf since reading <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000994.html">Absolutely American</a>. Purportedly one of the most popular novels at west point. A rousing tale following an infantryman from WW1 thru vietnam. Tends to glamorize military life and demonize all other careers, also denigrates spouses who don’t support the life fully. How do I feel about our armed forces after reading? A lot about honor in here but too much demonization of all other roles in society, and a little too much glorification of the warrior. * “Natural History by Justina Robson”:amazon. The old “encounter with alien artifact/culture which exposes the true nature of the universe” tale, but future potential variations of the human form and their attendant character implications are explored nicely. * “The Mill on the Floss”:amazon by Eliot. What great, fallible, deeply human characters. No supermen here, just people bumbling through life.</p>

				<p><p>So had to relearn a bunch of cabin life skills from my youth over the last two weeks:</p>

<p>* Power and heat. where is the propane turn on for the cabin? for the stove? for the grill? How do I check propane supply? Who do we get propane from? * What is that munching sound in the wall? What do we do about it? * Securing a boat. Installing an engine lock, storing the gas can and gas line separately during our absence, hiding the kill switch. Not a deterrent to a determined thief but the casual thief will be frustrated. * Saltwater, 4-cycle engine maintenance. New to me, I grew up with 2-cycle Evinrudes. Flushing with fresh water, checking oil, spraying the engine to keep salt from getting a foothold. * Garbage disposal. The joys of hauling your own trash to the dump. As someone on the island said, the dump is the great equalizer, sooner or later everyone has to go there.</p>

Minor IT disasters on return – 3 power strips blown at home (can’t be a coincidence), one machine that forgot its hard disk config and was trying to boot off its 7200rpm data drive instead of the 10krpm raid0 array of system drives, and of course my web server had gone toes up for some reason (nothing in the logs??). All is well again.</p>
