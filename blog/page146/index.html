				<p><p>I’ve been pretty skeptical of tagging. There is a lot of evidence that most people don’t bother to associate keywords with content, no matter how easy the software makes it. And tags drift over time, and people disagree on the meanings of individual tags. And search engines make it easy to search the raw text of sites, so why bother with adding keywords? If I want to annotate a site with keywords, well I can just create a blog entry that uses those keywords, and I will be able to find it later on my own blog, or on Google.</p>

<p>But I am intrigued by <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/06/tagcloud-beta-create-keyword-clouds.html">Tagcloud, thanks Phil</a>. And by the <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/06/09/MovableTypeTaggingPlugin.html">Tags Power Tool</a> for movable type. These both make it way easier to automatically create a category hierarchy for my own site. I try to use categories today but they have all the problems of tags; these tools would perhaps help me to automatically create tags and categories.</p>

<p>I guess I am still skeptical about tagging schemes that require people to explicitly tag content, but tools which smartly autogenerate tags seem interesting and possibly useful.</p>

				<p><p>I’ve done a good job since rededicating myself to exercise – getting out on the trails 2 or 3 times a week. And I am still having fun.</p>

<p>On the downside, I fell and broke a rib Sunday. Ouch. Doesn’t prevent me from hiking but quite painful. Basically a rookie mistake – climbed onto a moss-covered fallen log and my feet flew out from under me. I have crappy instincts yet when it comes to the woodlands. As a kid I spent all my summers on the <a href="http://www.pointeaubarilchamber.com/">rocky shores of georgian bay</a>, and to this day I am pretty good at scrambling along rocky, slippery shorelines – I have great instincts when it comes to mossy, slippery, unstable rocks. I have none of those instincts for woodlands terrain.</p>

<p>I haven’t done a podcast yet, and well, it just needs to get way easier and simpler than this if I am ever going to. I can’t see podcast creation ever becoming mainstream, certainly not at this level of complexity. Maybe if I could just talk to my cell to record a high quality podcast, i’d do it.</p>

Instead I got back out to <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/gis/vmc/Recreation.htm#CM">Cougar Mountain</a> for the second time this week. Starting from the RedTown trailhead, i went out on the Wildside trail and then did a counterclockwise loop on the Marshall’s Hill/De Leo Wall circuit. A nice circuit, I strongly recommend the counterclockwise direction, or you face a killer trail up the De Leo Wall.</p>

				<p><p>* Geez I am now like two generations behind on cooling technology – <a href="http://www.nanocoolers.com/products_cooling.php">liquid metal coolers for pcs</a>, <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/22/194250&amp;from=rss">liquid metal cooling for video cards</a>. My cooling problem though is a little different – with 6 computers in 2 small rooms, plus printers, monitors, scanners, speakers, etc etc etc – my problem is room temperature, not pc temperature. No amount of liquid metal cooling is going to make my room cooler. I have installed a small Carrier single-room air conditioner to deal with the issue – so I guess that puts me at the bleeding edge of homes, not many have dedicated AC for computer rooms. So I salvage a little geek pride. * I’d love to explore <a href="http://www.cubix.com/ls/LSD_Links.html">using these bifurcated computers</a> as a heat solution. Put all the electronics in one room, and just run fiber to the I/O devices in another room. * An interesting <a href="http://weblog.garyturner.net/archives/001740.html">observation on home storage</a> – gary asserts that home storage needs are surpassing busines storage needs. I guess this is not surprising, the video subsystem in PC is driven by consumer apps, not business apps, so why not storage? But gosh we need a consumer-friendly reliability and backup solution – RAID and tapes aren’t it. * <a href="http://wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,66498,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2">Gigapixel cameras</a> are coming. OK it sounds like you need a small team of scientists, a truckload of equipment, and some incredibly expensive optics, so I guess we won’t see a Nikon Coolpix version soon. But hey that sounds like what it took initially to make a mainframe computer run and look where we are. Actually I don’t care that much about gigapixel cameras – but boy would I give an arm and a leg for gigapixel eyeglasses – realtime zooming in on images miles away would be handy. * Have to get a <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/News/Story/0,1585,a4-c407-n350,00.html">Babble</a> when they are available – <em>“In essence, Babble turns you into a small crowd–and changes how other people hear your voice,” he added. “The result is that those outside your workspace cannot understand your actual spoken words.”</em> . I can’t claim to need one but how cool. * And this has nothing to do with PCs – but I need this <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000735.php">weedburner</a>. Why trim weeds when a flaming torch will do just as well? Actually this seems like a disaster in the making.</p>

				<p><p>We hadn’t been to <a href="http://www.bisonmain.com/">Bis on Main</a> in years, I am not sure why. We had an outstanding dinner there last night – the best salmon we’ve had in a restaurant in a while. The place was packed as well, clearly the busiest place in Bellevue. I’m not sure how this place fell of our list, but it is back on. (<a href="http://members.judysbook.com/posts/content/review.aspx?ci=3954">Crossposted to Judy’s Book</a>)</p>

				<p><p>Lots of posts recently as people realize that we aren’t going to see cable/satellite HD feeds into MCE machines for a long time – <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000620044935/">No CableCARD for Windows Media Center until Longhorn (probably)</a>, Say It Ain’t So Joe… <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=1531">Why HDTV Support in MCE Won’t Change Until Longhorn Arrives</a>. Not at all shocking, the PC is DRM swiss cheese. Certainly suggests that the closed boxes – TIVO, captive settop boxes – have a long life yet in the home. I bet that you don’t see HDTV support on the PC until you can run a separate OS in a separate VM with hardware-enforced DRM – ie, until you can run a closed hardware/software box inside a PC.</p>

<p>Meanwhile tho, the MCE developer economy continues to grow – <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=320">here’s a list of plugins you can install</a>. Regardless of HD capability, these boxes make way cool DVD players. As does the <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2005_05_15_archive.htm#111625442821583132">XBOX 360</a>. Sure seems to me that the DVD player market will break into two – cheap low-end fixed function players, and then at the high end, people will put in an XBOX, Mac Mini, MCE, or PS3 box.</p>

<p>Another interesting idea is the <a href="http://www.tvharmony.com/blog/archives/2005/05/echostar_to_rol.html">PocketDish</a>. This seems compelling to me, if I could take all my Tivo or Dish content on the road, without futzing around with a full laptop pc, I’d be interested.</p>

<p>Some interesting <a href="http://www.mindjack.com/feature/piracy051305.html">thoughts by Mark Pesce</a> on the future of TV – <em>“The idea of an advertising payload attached unobtrusively to the television program has a certain appeal; it can be ignored, but it’s always present. The audience can’t edit it out of the program without destroying the content of the program. Audiences will learn accept them — so long as the advertisements aren’t too busy, distracting, or otherwise obnoxious.”</em> We’ve watched this whole season of Alias via torrent downloads and I would have been happy to get an HD download direct from ABC or my affiliate which had modest advertising content in it.</p>
