    <p><strong>What makes a great school website?</strong> You can look at a lot of the award winners and I think you can start to draw some conclusions. #1 is student involvement. Students have the energy, the breadths of interests, the technical savvy to really contribute. #2 is currency. The great websites have all kinds of current articles and are updated frequently.</p>

<p>Most of these websites are public schools and are oriented towards current students. I think for a private school we need to serve better the prospective student base, the parent base, and the donor base. As many college sites do.</p>

<p>There are probably some good task-based metrics we could come up with. For each user segment, how easy is it for them to get to the 5 most important items/perform the 5 most important tasks.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/11/06/school-web-site-principles.html">School Web Site Principles</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>School Web Site Principles</strong>. I’ve thought about a little more and am starting to develop some requirements and design principles wrt school websites.</p>

<p>My current take on principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Student involvement. Students should do the bulk of the work for developing and maintaining the site. They have the energy. They have the knowhow. It is a great learning experience. It doesn’t require a huge budget.</li>
  <li>Content management. At the base of the school website should be a great content management system. We want every member of the school community to be able to easily post content in the most natural way for them. Standard documents, email – they should all be able to be easily posted to the system, without having to edit the website to take the content in. (A multiuser blog architecture would work nicely).</li>
  <li>Every publication created at the school should be created with the web as the primary publication target. Syllabi, meeting agendas, newsletters – let’s get it all on the web. We want the website to be lively and constantly updated, let’s get everything up there.</li>
  <li>Let’s leverage the effort of others and use standard software packages to build the website. No one should be building new website scripts and content management systems – let’s leverage what exists and what is economically viable – blog technology again is a good start as it is very economical.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with other schools. Every school needs the same technology for their website. It is not a source of competitive advantage. Let’s collaborate with other area schools or schools nationwide on the technology and ideas.</li>
  <li>Clean separation of content, layout, and code. As articulated above we need to cleanly separate out content – we want every member of the school community regardless of their technology orientation to be able to get their content posted on the web. We don’t need to turn everyone into webmasters or PHP coders. We also want to separate out cleanly layout from code. So that the members of the school community who care about design and have design skills can work on site design, while the members who care about coding and architecture can work on coding and architecture. Pretty obvious web design principles but not something that most schools practice as far as I can see.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>VC firms vow that they will take countermeasures against public pension funds that disclose sensitive information about private equity performance – such as excluding them from upcoming funds. Notes one VC: ‘It’s unbelievable how stupid they are-they’re winning the battle but losing the war. If I had to choose between two investors [one of which required greater disclosure than the other], I would go with the people that don’t have disclosure requirements.’ Thus far, UTIMCO and CalPERS are the two largest institutional investors that have pledged greater transparency on private equity performance. VC industry insiders now worry that other institutional investors may follow their example.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Shadows</strong>. Also from <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com">Lockergnome</a>:</p>

<p><em>The human eye can see three-dimensional objects because of how light bounces off of the objects and into our eyes. Well, you could apply the same principle to your Windows environment by adding shadows to your open windows, because then your mind would perceive light and the open windows would stand out as if they were three-dimensional. <a href="http://www.h5.dion.ne.jp/~yzathome/software/yzshadow/index_en.html">Y’z Shadow for Windows XP</a> does just that, and takes your Windows experience to the third dimension. The application simply adds a slight shadow to every open window and the taskbar. You can change the depth and color of the shadow, which can give your Desktop environment a whole new feel. I decided to give all of my open windows a little neon glow and I must say I think the effect is here to stay.</em></p>

<p>Update: this looks really cool but man does it slow down window painting. I wonder if it is implemented efficiently using the latest directx/videocard facilities. I wonder if it will be faster on my Radeon 9700 machine at home.</p>

    <p><strong>FLAC v1.0.4</strong>. From <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com">Lockergnome</a>:</p>

<p><em>I don’t claim to be an audiophile, but I still love good music. I’m content with the quality and sound of an MP3 file, but I do have some friends who don’t like MP3s because of the loss of audio quality in the compressed format. That’s great, but who wants a bunch of huge WAV audio files taking up all your hard drive space? <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</a> stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, and basically that means that you can use FLAC to compress your WAV files without losing audio quality in the compression process. FLAC won’t let you make a file nearly as small as an MP3, but it was able to turn one of my 42MB WAV files into a much smaller 30MB FLAC file. That may not seem like a lot, but imagine doing that to an entire music directory! FLAC also comes with a plug-in that allows you to listen to FLAC files in Winamp. FLAC does run from a command prompt, but on the same Web site you can download a Windows GUI front end that makes the whole conversion process much easier. For you programmers out there, FLAC is open source, so that means that you have access to all the source code and can incorporate this codec into your own applications. I guess my best friend may not have to buy a second hard drive now!</em></p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/11/03/how-many-megapixels.html">How Many Megapixels</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>How Many Megapixels</strong>. So I saw yesterday that kodak is introducing a <a href="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/products/cameras/dcsPro14n/dcsPro14nIndex.jhtml?id=0.2.6.30.5.8.3&amp;lc=en">14 Megapixel camera</a> for prosumers. Wow. I remember when a guy in a camera store told me “you’ll never need more than 3 megapixels”. Yeah, just like I will never need more than 16K of RAM…</p>

<p>I started to wonder about the logical limit to megapixel growth in cameras. Will we want 100 megapixel cameras? Gigapixel cameras? Terapixel cameras?</p>

<p>Well some quick internet searching tells me that the demand for cameras in the gigapixel range will happen in our lifetime. It is pretty easy to find discussions today on the net of people needing cameras approaching 100 megapixels. For great resolution prints at 11x14, you can chew up pixels fast. I think average people will do this.</p>

<p>And bleeding edge people are talking about gigapixel cameras – for instance <a href="http://snap.lbl.gov/pubdocs/SNAP_Introduction.ppt">NASA mission planning</a> and people researching <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0208/0208013.pdf">petabyte database scaling</a> (again astronomy images).</p>

<p>Will average joes like me want to have a gigapixel camera? My guess is yes or something close to it. I am betting we will all want to eventually have digital photos with at least the resolution of today’s film. And per some discussions on various photo sites, that means we will want <a href="http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0011Yu">400Megapixel+</a> cameras for images with the resolution (pixel, color, and intensity) of film.</p>

<p>My gut says we won’t stop there but that will be a topic for a later post…</p>

    <p><strong>College Football</strong>. Wow what a great day for the Buckeyes. A super win over Minnesota, and losses by so many other contenders. I just did a quick pro forma recalc of the BCS polls and, if OSU/Miami/Oklahoma all move up as expected in the computer polls, and if WSU moves up as expected, it is going to be just about a dead heat between OSU and Miami for the 3rd spot. If the effect of WSU winning is greater than linear (ie it opens up the strength of schedule lead OSU has over Miami even more, or WSU moves up higher than 5 in the BCS), OSU could take the number 2 spot! On pins and needles…</p>

My “Ben” rat crate fizzled totally – soundtrack died, door rattling motor died. My DMX remote failed so I couldn’t manually turn on the doghouse fogger, tho the automated system did just fine. I know I should relax but I am already starting to think about next year – replacement of all x10 with DMX, a better remote control option (maybe using a pda and 802.11), some pneumatic effects.</p>
