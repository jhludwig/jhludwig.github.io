The first day of contact is Sunday, Aug. 10. On Monday, Aug. 11, the team will begin a 2-1, 2-1, 2-1 regimen, meaning two practices on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and single sessions on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The same schedule will be in effect the week of Aug. 18. The second practice on Monday, Wednesday and Friday will be open to the media and to the public.</em></p>
