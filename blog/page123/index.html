An interesting read but the terminology was way beyond my high school biology. Basically tho bioinformatics seems to be an amalgam of db programming, string processing, and some probability/statistics. I certainly understand better now why people would want to create a <a href="http://www.bioperl.org">Bioperl</a> project.</p>

The BROADBAND Phone Company…</a>. People seem very enthusiastic about. I personally don’t quite get it – within our extended family, everyone has a cell phone with a huge bucket of minutes, they’ve moved their long distance usage to the cell phone, and so their local phone bill has dropped to the basic $20-30/month level. Thus Vonage has little draw for them. Maybe the excited users are people with a lot of overseas calling?</p>

    <p>B@$tards at AOL spammed my desktop with all kinds of ad links for AOL Broadband, during a minor version upgrade of AOL Instant Messenger.

    <p>Most books I read I donate to the library or goodwill, as I think I’ll never look at them again. Some books I keep at home on the bookshelf because I think I may want to look at again, or I may want to refer someone else to. A very few each year I put on the bookshelf in a special place where I will remember its location immediately. And then just once every couple of years have I been motivated to immediately go order some extra copies of a book and send immediately to people.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465030327/qid=1059407232/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-0045850-2531834?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: Letters to a Young Contrarian">Letters to a Young Contrarian</a> by Christoper Hitchens is in the last category. A great book. I immediately ordered copies and sent to my young relatives. Great, wise counsel on how to live a principled, thoughtful life and not just get drawn into the crowd. And the style chosen makes the material very accessible, despite the many references to sometimes unfamiliar material. Every young ambitious person out to make their mark on the world should read this book.</p>
