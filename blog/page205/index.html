				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">29 August 2003</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Letter from <a href="http://ohiostatebuckeyes.ocsn.com/" title="OhioStateBuckeyes.com : The Official Web Site of Ohio State Athletics">OhioState AD Andy Geiger</a> received today, probably sent to the entire alumni association:</p>

<p>Dear Ohio State Football Fan,</p>

<p>Will any of us ever forget the thrills of the 2002 Football Season and the Buckeyes’ triumphant journey to the Fiesta Bowl and the National Championship? An unprecedented fourteen victories. Thrillingly close games. Individual and collective heroics that carried Ohio State to the very top of college football. Most of all, I treasure the sportsmanship, teamwork, and integrity our team demonstrated along the path to success.</p>

<p>Regrettably, other aspects of last season won’t soon be forgotten either. All season, we witnessed and received letters, email, and phone calls telling us of the vulgarity, rudeness, poor sportsmanship – even vandalism – exhibited by some Ohio State “fans.” These people chose a most unfortunate way of “supporting” our team – with a lack of respect for our opponents, for fellow Buckeye fans, and for themselves. They spoiled the day for many.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we live in a time when the put-down, trash-talking and humiliation have become part of the entertainment and sports culture. This is not the Ohio State way. Not now, not in the past, and certainly not in the future.</p>

<p>Our student-athletes are expected to be role models as representatives of The Ohio State University and I support this notion. However, I believe <em>everyone</em> associated with the University has the same responsibility to make a positive presentation to this community, and to our visitors, any time we host an event.</p>

<p>This season, I am asking for your help. Please let us know of any incidents you witness – or any indignities you suffer personally – either at Ohio Stadium or at an away game. Help us identify those who inflect their poor behaviour on others. Our Department of Athletics has adopted six fundamental values that our coaches, student-athletes, and support staff strive to live by. They are: Education, Integrity, Excellence, Innovation, Respect for the Individual, Leadership.</p>

<p>I urge you, as a member of the Ohio State community, to embrace these core values. You will contribute to making The Ohio State University the very best in everything we do. And, you will help us make our events friendly, wholesome and welcoming for our opponents, their fans, and of course our own Buckeye family.</p>

<p>Cheer heartily for our Buckeyes. Rejoice in the essence of intercollegiate athletics, which allows us to send our sons and daughters into competition with their sons and daughters. But, remember that the great rivalries we enjoy in the Big Ten are built upon a tradition of trust and cooperation. This, tos is worthy of celebration!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Andy Geiger<br />
Director of Athletics</p>

<p><strong>My take:</strong> It is great that the University sent this out. It is a fine first step, and the fact that it did not come bundled with an appeal for money gives it more weight. I hope the University sends this message out 4-5 more times during the season, repetition will help.</p>

Colour me dubious. I had a p2t phone for years and after a burst of initial activity i quit using it, it just wasn’t that much more convenient than a regular phone call. And I’m on my third camera phone and i hardly ever use the camera. The pictures suck and it is too hard to do anything useful with them. Sure, the pictures will get better, but so will those of my regular digital camera, there will still be a gap. and it will get easier to send and blog the pictures. but geez, i just wish the phone was better at being a phone. better at syncing my address book with my desktop. not dropping so many damn calls. better coverage. easier call history use. all these other non-phone features are just clutter.</p>

				<p><p>We were at <a href="http://www.pomona.edu" title="Pomona College">Pomona College</a> last week and I have to say, the staff was great, everyone was super helpful. And the fact that the student body is the <a href="http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/rankings.asp?listing=1022748&amp;LTID=1">2nd happiest</a> student body in the country makes us feel good. Good luck L.</p>

<p>Update: some quick feedback on the Pomona IT and telecom resources. Not much WIFI on campus – a few access points but it is not pervasive in the dorms, that’s too bad. Of course they do have 10Mbit links to all the dorm rooms – I wonder when they will switch to 100mbit? On the telecom side, the school recommends T-Mobile but I am underwhelmed with the coverage. Word on the street is that Verizon may be the way to go.</p>
