I think they were super thoughtful about the whole process, and I’m excited to see the product, I am of course a backer.</p>

<p>And it has become clear to me what Kickstarter is really for. It is not about raising money. These guys raised a modest amount, they could have funded this easily themselves or from friends. But they have built a great community of early adopters and backers, who feel like part of the team, who are going to help evangelize the product, who are influentials. And that is what Kickstarter really seems to be about (for tech products, I am clueless about movies or other domains) – it is in some sense a marketing expense, it is the way you reach out to the influentials and early adopters and get them on board and pulling for you, which is a HUGELY valuable asset for a young company. It is certainly not about the cash – the $147K these guys raised, less the Kickstarter and AMZN fees, is nothing compared to the funding needs of the business.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Stories-American-Literature-Series/dp/1564786021/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371093344&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=joseph+mcelroy">Night Soul and Other Stories</a> by Joseph McElroy. I just don’t enjoy short stories. These seem well-written and intriguing, but the lack of plot and character development due to the strictures of the form just doesn’t work for me. Giving up.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Portobello-A-Novel-Ruth-Rendell/dp/B0076TP3C8/ref=sr_1_27?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371913745&amp;sr=8-27&amp;keywords=ruth+rendell">Portobello</a> by Ruth Rendell. Given the author I expected a straight up mystery but this is an odd little tale of characters along Portobello Road and their obsessions and delusions and misbehaviors. Enjoyable but not hard-hitting.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Dervish-House-Ian-McDonald/dp/1616145455/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373382811&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+dervish+house">The Dervish House</a> by Ian McDonald. Somehow in my trip through the science fiction canon I have missed McDonald, and that has been a mistake. A good tale of a near future Istanbul awash in nano tech. The characters and ideas were much better than the plot, the story got a little too Dan Brown-ish in parts for me, and overall there were too many moving parts. A better book is in here, focused on just 1-2 of the characters and their stories. But still, a good read.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Firmin-Sam-Savage/dp/0385342659/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374076534&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=firmin">Firmin</a> by Sam Savage. I had no memory of why I bought this book, but what a quirky little tale. A hyper intelligent rat aspires to rise above his essential rat nature, with inevitable triumphs and crashing failures. Not unlike our own lives. Enjoyable.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last book reminds me of how valuable it is to search out small publishers and see what they are emitting. <a href="http://coffeehousepress.org">Coffee House</a>, <a href="https://www.graywolfpress.org">Graywolf</a>, etc. With the consolidation among the major publishers and the collapse of retail book selling, you can’t rely on the mainstream to bring interesting writing to you.</p>

How awesome, even if it is not really meant in tribute.</p>

<p>This was the first shipping product I worked on at Microsoft. A great great team of people. I remember how surprised we all were on the product team when the product was marketed at launch as a “Notes Killer”. We were just trying to make networking work within Windows, because up to that point, networking install for Windows was a ball buster.</p>

<p>I still have a WFW screwdriver.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">09 July 2013</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>So we haven’t received mail for about a week and I stopped at the post office, a 1 month temporary vacation hold was placed on our mail. The hold was placed at the USPS website, anyone can do this, there is no security. They had my name and address correct tho they supplied a NYC cell phone number as a contact number. Or maybe it was just a random number.</p>

<p>So I am trying to figure out if this is some sort of scam, was someone intending to pick up my mail (because no valid ID was demanded to pick it up), or were they planning on having it redelivered somewhere (tho the hold order had it being delivered at the end of the month to my address)?</p>

<p>Or was this just a db error at the post office?</p>

<p>I don’t seem to find anything on the internet about vacation mail hold scams but very curious.</p>

<p>We had a very nice visit at <a href="http://www.firwoodfarmalpacas.com/">Firwood Farms</a> today, this place is an unassuming little gem. Way off the beaten path, and not very commercial, but a hugely nice and good couple who own the place and make a home for rescue alpacas (as well as some of their own). And the alpacas are so engaging, very interested in meeting us (we did have food in our hands), and not shy a bit, tho a little cautious. Their eyes are stunning. This place is about 1000x more meaningful and touching than any zoo. Worth a side trip.</p>

				<p><p>However you feel about Snowden’s actions, whether he is a patriot or traitor, brilliant or naive, you have to give him credit for having the balls to take a stand. <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bunnyhat.jpg"><img src="images/bunnyhat.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/insouciance/" /></a>He has put his life and liberty at risk for something he believes in. He has thrown away his career, his relationships, his home, everything. I’m not completely sure how I feel about all his actions, though I have a strong bias towards more openness and more government accountability and more transparent oversight. But I certainly admire his courage.</p>

<p>Contrast with <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/06/intelligence-committee-wyden-snowden-came.php">members of Congress who apparently were afraid to break a subcommittee rule.</a> Gosh, what happens if you break a subcommittee rule, do you have to sit at the wrong table at lunch, or do you lose your parking pass, or do you have to wear a funny hat on Thursdays? It must be horrific.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>To address my ADSL woes, I am considering getting Dish Satellite Internet Access. I’m already a Dish TV customer so this seemed like it would be the easiest path.</p>

<p>My physical dish location is 40 feet from my house though, and I need to make sure I have the right cable in the ground before the Dish installer shows up.</p>

<p>After 4 phone calls with Dish, I finally found someone that purportedly knew the cable requirements. They told me that I would keep my existing dish with its RG6 coax cable for tv, and that I would have a 2nd dish with cat5 cable for the Internet. The 2nd dish part sounds fine, but cat5? I would have expected to run another rg6 cable to a modem in the house.</p>

<p>Anyone a dish Internet user?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Finally found a knowledgeable dish technician, solid copper RG6 is the correct requirement. this is what hughes requires as well, so it makes sense to me. I just couldn’t believe that dish would run cat5 (not even cat6) outdoors, and put the modem outdoors at the dish.</p>

				<p><p>ios7 first impressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the mail app i think i will like, seems a little easier to dispose of messages, and viewing messages is a lot cleaner</li>
  <li>i never used game center, mostly because i don’t care about the feature, but a little bit because it was so horribly ugly. nice to see that fixed</li>
  <li>sometimes you can be too subdued and too flat. the weather app doesn’t work for me, the difference between a sunny and rainy forecast is now so muted.</li>
  <li>all the new swipe from the bottom, side, etc behavior will take a while to get used to. tho quick access to airplane mode is nice.</li>
  <li>i’m interested in the new photo library features and sharing, tho at first glance, the whole collection thing doesn’t really work for me. collections are too small or too big.</li>
  <li>i hope i can airdrop easily between my mac and my phone. haven’t tried that yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>osx first impressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>laggy. wish i hadn’t installed. i am sure it will get better.</li>
  <li>maps app is cool i guess tho i will have to see how much i use it versus the browser alternatives. the “send to iOS” feature will be great, obviously not a new idea, but still i will be happy with.</li>
  <li>i suspect i will like finder tabs a lot. tags? i just don’t know. evidence from other domains suggests i won’t use them.</li>
  <li>books, keychain – yawn. hard to get excited about when there are great 3rd party solutions that work everywhere.</li>
</ul>

				<p><p>What’s disgusting you? Personally, I’m not upset with</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tech companies who may have delivered data to the government. When someone from the government shows up with a warrant, regardless of your feelings about the nature of the warrant, you pretty much have to comply. You assume the legal process is working correctly, and you comply. And if you see any reasonable flow of warrants, you do engineering work to make sure you can comply with warrants in the future, without compromising all your other users.</li>
  <li>The NSA and other entities who went thru whatever legal processes exist to get various court orders. They are doing their job. And as one observer notes:</li>
</ul>

I’m furious the gov’t is collecting my personal data! That stuff is only for Facebook! And Google! And any marketer willing to pay for it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I am pretty happy with</p>

<ul>
  <li>Snowden. Shining a light on these activities is good. A brave (and perhaps naive, but still brave) man. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/edward-snowden-in-hong-kong/276692/">James Fallows</a>’ article seems sensible.</li>
  <li>The press. Ditto. I am very glad we have a free press that digs and digs and digs.</li>
  <li>The members of the <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021149079_nsadelegationxml.html">Washington congressional delegation</a> who have voted against FISA.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not so happy with the bulk of our elected representatives who have hollowed out the 4th amendment, who think that secret briefings of Congress is sufficient oversight, who think that the 3 branches of government can balance each other without transparency or any citizen oversight, and who now call the actions of Snowden “reprehensible”. The President right on through most of Congress are out of step with me and many Americans.</p>

  <li>I think I will end up loving <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>. I shift my work across a lot of machines and being able to bring my entire dev environment with me seems like a great thing. Really this is the way I’d like all my apps to work. In case you are not clear why Vagrant is good, here is a snippet from their site:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re a developer, Vagrant will isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable, consistent environment, without sacrificing any of the tools you’re used to working with (editors, browsers, debuggers, etc.). Once you or someone else creates a single Vagrantfile, you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work. Other members of your team create their development environments from the same configuration, so whether you’re working on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows, all your team members are running code in the same environment, against the same dependencies, all configured the same way. Say goodbye to “works on my machine” bugs.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">Rich</a> turned me onto all the lens tests at <a href="http://www.photozone.de/all-tests">Photozone</a>. Awesome resource for lens data.</li>
  <li>More info on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brendangregg/linux-performance-analysis-and-tools">linux perf tools</a> than i know what to do with.</li>
  <li>A bunch of <a href="http://nvlabs.github.io/moderngpu/">nvidia gpu programming resources</a>. How do I do the same things on Haswell? OpenCL? Some cuda-to-intel tool? llvm? I’m probably seriously confused.</li>
