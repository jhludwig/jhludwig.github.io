				<p><p>ios7 first impressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the mail app i think i will like, seems a little easier to dispose of messages, and viewing messages is a lot cleaner</li>
  <li>i never used game center, mostly because i don’t care about the feature, but a little bit because it was so horribly ugly. nice to see that fixed</li>
  <li>sometimes you can be too subdued and too flat. the weather app doesn’t work for me, the difference between a sunny and rainy forecast is now so muted.</li>
  <li>all the new swipe from the bottom, side, etc behavior will take a while to get used to. tho quick access to airplane mode is nice.</li>
  <li>i’m interested in the new photo library features and sharing, tho at first glance, the whole collection thing doesn’t really work for me. collections are too small or too big.</li>
  <li>i hope i can airdrop easily between my mac and my phone. haven’t tried that yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>osx first impressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>laggy. wish i hadn’t installed. i am sure it will get better.</li>
  <li>maps app is cool i guess tho i will have to see how much i use it versus the browser alternatives. the “send to iOS” feature will be great, obviously not a new idea, but still i will be happy with.</li>
  <li>i suspect i will like finder tabs a lot. tags? i just don’t know. evidence from other domains suggests i won’t use them.</li>
  <li>books, keychain – yawn. hard to get excited about when there are great 3rd party solutions that work everywhere.</li>
</ul>

				<p><p>What’s disgusting you? Personally, I’m not upset with</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tech companies who may have delivered data to the government. When someone from the government shows up with a warrant, regardless of your feelings about the nature of the warrant, you pretty much have to comply. You assume the legal process is working correctly, and you comply. And if you see any reasonable flow of warrants, you do engineering work to make sure you can comply with warrants in the future, without compromising all your other users.</li>
  <li>The NSA and other entities who went thru whatever legal processes exist to get various court orders. They are doing their job. And as one observer notes:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Christian Finnegan <a href="https://twitter.com/christfinnegan">‏@ChristFinnegan</a><br />
I’m furious the gov’t is collecting my personal data! That stuff is only for Facebook! And Google! And any marketer willing to pay for it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I am pretty happy with</p>

<ul>
  <li>Snowden. Shining a light on these activities is good. A brave (and perhaps naive, but still brave) man. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/edward-snowden-in-hong-kong/276692/">James Fallows</a>’ article seems sensible.</li>
  <li>The press. Ditto. I am very glad we have a free press that digs and digs and digs.</li>
  <li>The members of the <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021149079_nsadelegationxml.html">Washington congressional delegation</a> who have voted against FISA.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not so happy with the bulk of our elected representatives who have hollowed out the 4th amendment, who think that secret briefings of Congress is sufficient oversight, who think that the 3 branches of government can balance each other without transparency or any citizen oversight, and who now call the actions of Snowden “reprehensible”. The President right on through most of Congress are out of step with me and many Americans.</p>

  <li>I think I will end up loving <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>. I shift my work across a lot of machines and being able to bring my entire dev environment with me seems like a great thing. Really this is the way I’d like all my apps to work. In case you are not clear why Vagrant is good, here is a snippet from their site:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re a developer, Vagrant will isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable, consistent environment, without sacrificing any of the tools you’re used to working with (editors, browsers, debuggers, etc.). Once you or someone else creates a single Vagrantfile, you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work. Other members of your team create their development environments from the same configuration, so whether you’re working on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows, all your team members are running code in the same environment, against the same dependencies, all configured the same way. Say goodbye to “works on my machine” bugs.</p>

  <li>More info on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brendangregg/linux-performance-analysis-and-tools">linux perf tools</a> than i know what to do with.</li>
  <li>A bunch of <a href="http://nvlabs.github.io/moderngpu/">nvidia gpu programming resources</a>. How do I do the same things on Haswell? OpenCL? Some cuda-to-intel tool? llvm? I’m probably seriously confused.</li>

				<p><p>Trying to get smarter about image processing and computer vision – kind of a random walk of books:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Image-Processing-Algorithmic-Introduction/dp/1846283795/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370612396&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Digital+Image+Processing%3A+An+Algorithmic+Approach+Using+Java">Digital Image Processing: An Algorithmic Approach Using Java</a> by Burger and Burge. Mix of theory and implementation on the most basic of image processing techniques. A nice starting point.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-OpenCV-Practical-Computer-Projects/dp/1849517827/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370612195&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mastering+opencv">Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects</a> by Baggio etc. Heavy on samples, light on theory, but still useful.</li>

<p>Also for break from tech:</p>

Liked Cloud Atlas (the book, never saw the movie), and so far really liking this. Great characters and does an excellent job of placing me into Japan in the year ~1700.</li>

W. Brands. A fine biography of FDR. The title led me to believe that it would be a little more focused on the conflict between his policies and the monied elite, but it was really a general biography of the most influential president of the last century.</li>

Snooty acclaim but I am giving up. The “oh my gosh they were secretly gay” idea just doesn’t do it for me anymore, you can’t carry a story on this point, it’s like trying to revolve a story around “he was secretly left-handed!”. Maybe 30 years ago this would have been interesting. Not now.</li>

Classic 70’s science fiction, some sort of Vance appreciation society is pulling these out of the back catalog and getting them out in e-book form. His characters seem stilted and awkward, age hasn’t treated them well, and yet a compelling tale.</li>

				<p><p>I recently left my Kindle on a plane, and now I have to get a new one (or migrate to ipad or whatever, the device used is not the point).</p>

<p>I’ve purchased 515 books over the years and read many of them. It is a disaster getting just my unread or currently-reading books over to a new device. The “Manage your Kindle” web page has no indication of read status, I have to go through each title and figure out what to do with it. And I can’t group or organize on the webpage at all. A really terrible experience. And hasn’t improved in years. Amazon has done nothing for the core Kindle market, people that actually read a lot of books.</p>

<p>Annoyed. Wasting my time, Amazon.</p>

				<p><p>So I’ve been acquiring and playing with 50-100 year old electrical lab instruments.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/freqmeter.jpg"><img src="images/freqmeter-300x225.jpg" alt="freqmeter" /></a>My latest is a <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_2/chpt_12/2.html">reed-type frequency meter</a>, I didn’t even know these things existed. Great admiration for the people who originally designed these things, a very clever little design. We tried a brief experiment to get it running today, but no response. We may not have been applying enough voltage, the wires in these things could probably handle 50+ amps.</p>

<p>I’ve also got this potentiometer<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/potentiometer.jpg"><img src="images/potentiometer-300x215.jpg" alt="potentiometer" /></a>, utterly crazy looking, and with controls and labels that are a mystery to me – terminals labeled E+ and E-, H and H1, L and L1, BA+, R, and a couple others. A big wonking selector switch that looks like it could transmit 50 amps, and a fine tuning gauge. I’ll be putting an ohmmeter on this thing to see what the hell is going on.</p>

<p>I’ve also got some more awesome potentiometers and voltmeters. As well as a variable capacitor. These things were built for the ages – massive wires, plenty of ventilation, solid wood and metal and bakelite construction. They are all amazingly beautiful.</p>

<p>I’m working to bond an arduino to some of these so I can use them for more mundane modern purposes. But they look great just sitting on the shelf.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Afterwards-A-Novel-Rosamund-Lupton/dp/0307716554/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366824603&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=afterwards">Afterwards</a> by Rosamund Lupton. A family is shattered by a school fire, and the critically injured mother battles to protect her kids and uncover the truth around the events. Great story about the relationship between a woman and her family, tested by extreme events. The voice used in the story is a little confusing at times – I read the Kindle version, I wonder if the printed version used typography to better set apart the actions and thoughts of various characters.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Standing-Another-Grave-Detective-Inspector/dp/0316224588/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366824842&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=standing+in+another+man%27s+grave">Standing in Another Man’s Grave</a> by Ian Rankin. Great detective tale featuring an abrasive self-destructive sleuth. I should read more in the series.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Thessaly-Deadly-Mystery-Mysteries/dp/0316217875/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366824968&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+doctor+of+thessaly">The Doctor of Thessaly</a> by Anne Zouroudi. Another great detective character and story. In both this tale and the Rankin, the leads care about justice and to hell with the rules. But they go about it totally different ways. The Rankin character is a blunt rusty knife, the Zouroudi character is a judo master. Fun stuff.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Beautiful-Forevers-Mumbai-Undercity/dp/1400067553/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367178907&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=behind+the+beautiful+forevers">Behind the Beautiful Forevers</a> by Katherine Boo. Fascinating but challenging read about life in the Mumbai slums. Challenging because the lives depicted are so brutal, the culture so corrupt. I’m left wrung out, and having no idea how to do anything about.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Rule-Law-Tom-Bingham/dp/014103453X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367643203&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rule+of+law">The Rule of Law</a> by Tom Bingham. Well written and pretty crisp, a nice coverage of what the phrase “the rule of law” means, its history, and implications for today. Worthwhile.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Skippy-Dies-Novel-Paul-Murray/dp/0865478619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367643315&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=skippy+dies">Skippy Dies</a> by Paul Murray. Eh. Teenage boys can be creeps, I don’t need a whole novel pointing this out over and over and over again.</li>

A rocking show – just his current small backing band of 3 women on drums, bass, and guitar. Opened with a few classics, including a nice variant on “I Could Never Take The Place of Your Man”. A lot of his new material. A nice cover of the Cars’ “Let’s Go” with a shout out to Boston. A really nice cover of “Crimson and Clover”. Along the way Prince was in great lead guitar form, and also picked up the bass at one point for a great solo.</p>

<p>He is a captivating performer. I’ve seen Jack White in a small venue and Buddy Guy, they both pour a lot of emotion into their guitar work, Prince is up there as well.</p>
