    <p>From <a href="http://www.the-ozone.net/football/2006/minnesota/michiganmonday.htm">Michigan Monday</a></p>

<p><em>It also means that we are now in that portion of the season where Michigan and Ohio State are showing each other purposeful looks. Michigan went with five wides and five and six-man fronts. The Buckeyes, meanwhile, are throwing passes with Ted Ginn. Even though the games may not be that interesting leading up to November 18, the gamesmanship sure will be.</em></p>

<p>This is exactly right. The next three games are all about showing the opponent just what you want them to see. I bet that some parts of the OSU offensive seem strangely ineffective for the next 3 games.</p>

    <p>going back to college in your 40s is interesting. On the plus side, I am way more equipped to deal with ambiguity, and I generally don’t stress about the course.</p>

<p>On the minus side, my analytical skills have atrophied away thanks to 20 years of using the autosum button in excel and its ilk. So dealing with a message like the following is pretty daunting – I have to recover college calculus and physics in days.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2006/10/22/halloween-2006-status-pneumatics.html">Halloween 2006 Status -- Pneumatics</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’m feeling pretty good about pneumatics for this halloween.</p>

<p>My primary use is for a <a href="http://www.frightprops.com/frightprops/props/Product.asp?ID=0686">creature crate</a>. This is working really well, money well spent as I don’t think I could have created anything as durable as this. I’ve “retired” my opening/closing coffin from last year as this crate is jus so much more effective.</p>

<p>A secondary use is for a popping ghost. I’m using an <a href="http://www.efx-tek.com/">efx-tek</a> prop controller with some 24vdc <a href="http://www.smcusa.com/">smc</a> solenoids (off ebay) to shoot a blast of 120psi air at irregular intervals. The air is directed upwards along a line from the ground up to a tree limb, and a lightweight ghost (gauzy fabric around a clear plastic cup which catches the air blast) flies up the string 10 feet and then settles down. I’ll position it all behind a tombstone and light the ghost path. The pneuma and mechanics are rock solid, I’m happy with them. The ghost is fine, at night in sudden bursts no one will see how crappy it really looks. I’d love to have the skill/ideas to create a better lightweight ghost – it has to catch the air blast in a stiff inner cup structure, needs a lot of gauzy outstructure to float around, and needs to weigh very little – I am probably at 4 oz now and wouldn’t want it heavier. Oh and be weather resistant as this is for outdoor use.</p>

<p>Notes for 2007: better looking ghost. And build 3 of these for different spots in the yard.</p>

<p>it would be interesting to write up and discuss people’s best practices for identity protection. the other thing i am glad i do is to maintain basically two complete bank accounts. one is the “public” account, from which i write all checks, do automatic bill payment, etc. the other is a private account that is where my financial assets are really kept. they are at different institutions. i routinely move money over to the “public” account to pay bills. with this setup, if someone learns how to forge checks or compromises my atm card or something else, they have access to only a teeny tiny part of my assets and i can shut down that public account if i need to.</p>

A little mysterious how to get surround working, not as nice a config utility as the turtle beach card. And then the receiver was just plain mysterious. I had to do a “reset” to finally get it to emit 5.1 sounds – hold down the tone button, the power button for 3 seconds, then enter and then setup. i can imagine why this unit got returned to best buy, it tries to be so smart about deciding what source and output mode to use, but i think it gets wedged into misconfigs. Reset is your friend.</p>

I finally got a personal contact from alienware today:</p>

<p>_Dear Mr. Ludwig,</p>

<p>I tried to call you earlier today and left you a voicemail on the following regard. As I stated in the message, your system is ready to be shipped out, however earlier today Alienware received a chargeback dispute from your credit card company in the amount of $XXXX.XX. Unfortunately, we cannot ship the system out until this dispute is lifted. If you can please contact your credit card company and lift this dispute, it will be most helpful in expediting your order. Please feel free to contact me at anytime should you have any questions regarding this matter.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>XXXXXXXXXX XXXXX Critical Issues Agent Alienware Corporation</p>

<p>Phone: 305.XXX.XXXX Fax: 786.XXX.XXXX www.alienware.com_</p>

<p>Needless to say I will not be lifting the dispute. It is apparently the only lever I have – the system is just coincidentally ready to ship out the moment they receive the dispute notice. They can ship me the system and if it is perfect I will pay. I’d rather the money back.</p>
