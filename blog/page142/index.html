				<p><p>I’m doing some research on automotive engineering education for high school and undergrad students. Wonder if anyone has any tips. The things I’ve found so far:</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://students.sae.org/">SAE student site</a> is a fine place to look for information. Competitions, awards, internships – more college student focused. This <a href="http://www.sae.org/news/releases/05smfinal.htm">supermileage contes</a>t looks fun. I wonder if there is an opportunity to create some biodiesel version of this project. * The <a href="http://students.sae.org/chapters/choosecollege.htm">SAE website for college selection</a> has some good tips about programs. * <a href="http://www.kettering.edu/">Kettering University</a> -- formerly GMI – a highly regarded school, but Flint is tough duty. OK I haven’t been to Flint in 17 years, maybe it has improved. * Of course <a href="http://www.umich.edu">UM</a> has all kinds of programs – <a href="http://www.umtri.umich.edu/">Transportation Research</a>, <a href="http://arc.engin.umich.edu/">ARC</a> – but you have to cheer for the Wolverines and there are some lines I just can’t cross. OK full disclosure – I spent my freshman year in college at UM, I was a traitor to the state of Ohio, but I finally saw the light. * Down in NASCAR country, <a href="http://www.ces.clemson.edu/me/research/index.htm">Clemson</a> has a program. There must be other NASCAR state schools that have programs? * <a href="http://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/">Colorado State</a> from the SAE site is supposed to have a program of some sort. * The <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu/">art center college of design</a> in Pasadena has a program, more focused on aesthetics.</p>

				<p><p>As usual <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">Rich</a> has been a posting machine during the last month. Some of the highlights I’ve noted:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/11/iceland.html">Iceland travel</a>. I hear they have some fantastic river rafting there. I’m ready to go. Just added to my <a href="http://www.43places.com">43places</a> goals. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/14/perfect_ribs_and_grilled_chicken.html">Grilling resource</a> – I can always use grilling tips. * Rich’s <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/14/casio_exlim_exz750.html">small camera recos</a>. I’m about due. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/home_theater/2005/08/22/zoomplayer_rules.html">Tips on HT PC setup</a> – sounds like zoomplayer is essential. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/2005/08/26/ntfs_resizing.html">NTFS resizing tips</a>. I am sure I will need these some day. * Rich is playing <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/games/2005/08/31/fear.html">FEAR</a>. I think I need a new PC. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/08/31/gaming_pc.html">Rich on Gaming PCs</a>. Having bought 3 and bult 2 others, I am inclined to buy from Falcon Northwest for my next. Debugging the assembly of a high end machine with 2 SLI cards, 10K sata drives, raid arrays, fast dvd/cd drives – well it is just a lot easier to let the Falcon guys burn their time.</p>

				<p><p>A bit of rain today which made my hike a little damp. My one essential piece of raingear is <a href="http://www.orgear.com/home/category/home/headware/rain_hats">the Seattle Sombrero</a> – I picked up at <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a>. This hat is great for Northwest weather – a wide-enough brim to keep the drizzly rain out here off of almost my entire trunk. Won’t go out without it.</p>

				<p><p>Can’t wait for the season to start.</p>

<p>To put a little damper on my enthusiasm tho – <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005403.php">The buckeyes are already #3</a> – in football revenue. <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_05_01__arch_file.htm#111711545198246615">The Sports Economist points out</a> that expenditures don’t seem to correlate strongly with success though. But they don’t negatively correlate with success either.</p>

<p>Either way, about 85 kids are generating $46M in revenue for the school, which is getting used up to support other sports, build nice facilities, and pay some big salaries to adults. I still have a problem with the morality of this, more of the money should flow to the benefit of the players on the team. Some small suggestions – give the players 8 years of free tuition so that they can realistically get an education and play football. Or underwrite the tuition for the children of former players. Fund a modest disability insurance program for the players.</p>

<p>Anyway, kickoff is 17 days away…</p>

				<p><p>* “What’s My Name, Fool?”:amazon is a great collection of writings on sports by Dave Zirin. Zirin writes about the dirty underside of sports – the exploitation of poor uneducated young athletes; racism, sexism, and homophobia; the exploitation of sports by media and by politicians; the grotesque amounts of public monies spent on professional sports. Great great stuff. The histories of Ali, Jackie Robinson, Curt Flood, and others who fought for reform and for justice are illuminating. A very worthy read. * “Cheaper by the Dozen”:amazon – What a wonderful book. The father is an amazing character, the stories are fabulous. A very bittersweet ending, but that serves to make the story more human and authentic. Don’t know how I missed this growing up. * “The Ginger Man”:amazon by J P Donleavy – Horrid. Couldn’t finish. Brutish character, I learned nothing from him. The “Nicholas Baker”:amazon of 40 years ago – horrid little story that doesn’t need to be told. * “Gravity’s Rainbow”:amazon – A lot of interesting references and construction. But ultimately I didn’t care about anything happening in the book and put it down after 100 pages. If you want a farcical wartime book, read Catch-22. * “Keeping Watch”:amazon and “Folly”:amazon by Laurie R King. Wow, great pageturners. Great mysteries, great twists (especially keeping watch), really great characters who you care about. I like these much better than her period mysteries.</p>
