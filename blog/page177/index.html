				<p><p>For my first Hesse ever, I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312278497/qid=1081897958/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-2952831-9460018?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi)">The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi)</a>. I found it to be a pretty provoking read that seems still quite relevant today – certainly a valuable read for anyone considering a deep investment in higher education. And I found the structure of the book (intro to the game; biography; posthumous writings of Knecht) interesting and a break from the typical structure of most novels.</p>

<p>Clearly the book has some obsessive fans – just search the web for “Magister Ludi”, “Joseph Knecht”, or “Glass Bead Game” (I think these people miss the point of the book).</p>

<p>I had a goal earlier this year to read a new and different magazine each week – this book made me drop that goal. It was a compelling piece of writing, and made me realize that most magazines consist of a bag of ads interspersed with whatever articles were available at deadline. OK that is a little cynical but I still think I’ll use my reading time to read more substantial and provoking works.</p>

<p>hmm, this seems unfortunate. it is not clear to me i want a lot of storage innovation on the client, that just seems to lead to more stateful clients, i’ve been trying to extract locked up state from my clients for years. i want more storage in the cloud, available and usable from any client machine i happen to be at.</p>

I guess it was my riveting testimony that drove the parties to settle. I was subpoena’d by Sun to testify and was asked a bunch of questions about my job back in ‘95 thru ‘97. Mostly questions about java vms, class libs, etc. Who can remember all this crap? By my rough calculation, I spent well under 1% of time at Microsoft worrying about java, and since leaving Microsoft in ‘99 I’ve started a company, invested in close to 30 other companies, seen hundred of business plans, learned a bunch of new technologies, had a very busy personal life, etc. I can’t remember what JNI is let alone why I might have ever cared about it.</p>
