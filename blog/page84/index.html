  <h1><a href="/2005/09/06/osu-34-miami-oh-14.html">OSU 34, Miami (OH) 14</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK so this wasn’t much of an opponent for the Buckeyes. The game had the feel of a scrimmage, OSU seemed to be running at 90% speed.</p>

<p>OSU is going to need 3 or 4 balls in play to get all the talent involved on the offensive. A plethora of skill position players – 2 QBs, Ginn, several emerging tailbacks, a good receiving corps – gosh this team could be the most explosive offensive team in the Tressel era if they can get it all together.</p>

<p>And the first string defense did a nice job shutting down Miami but not sure how much of a test this was. The Miami QB was very rattled early.</p>

<p>Huston did a nice job replacing Nugent. Hit on every opportunity.</p>

<p>I have to rant a little about ABC/ESPN/DirecTV. Halfway thru the 3rd, ABC cuts away to the Oklahoma game. OK I kind of get it, the OSU game was over, and the Oklahoma game was a huge upset. But I am paying DirecTV for the College Gameplan package so I can see every freaking game, and did they unblock the OSU game? No, they did not.</p>

<p>And just to top it off, with 5 minutes to go in the Oklahoma game, the local affiliate switches to the start of the UW/Air Force game! Grrr….</p>

    <p>From the WSJ and other press, discussion of the <a href="http://www.mcall.com/business/local/all-mosaicaug31,0,4278363.story?coll=all-businesslocal-hed">mosaic feature</a> coming to our TV screens – watch 8 football games at once.</p>

<p>I think this is just brilliant. Football fans will pay for this. And further keeps the DSL guys at bay – they can’t even deliver one video stream, let alone 8 simultaneous games.</p>

<p>There is so much discussion about hollywood content, drm, iptv, etc – we seem to forget that live sports may be a much more important driver of video in the home. Certainly in my household our video provider selections are driven by sports programming issues – college game packages, hdtv availability, etc.</p>

Emerging producers may be able to produce basic high volume goods cheaply, but it will take them a while to catch up with highly-engineered green goods and services. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/chemical_proces.html">Martin discovers process modelling software</a> – I have no real use for these tools but they are incredibly fun to play with. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/some_fun_with_o.html">Current supply and demand numbers</a> – fuel prices are only going one way. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/from_bits_to_ba.html">From Bits to Barrels</a> – Martin’s contribution to SNS, journaling his transformation into the John D.

    <p>I’m doing some research on automotive engineering education for high school and undergrad students. Wonder if anyone has any tips. The things I’ve found so far:</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://students.sae.org/">SAE student site</a> is a fine place to look for information. Competitions, awards, internships – more college student focused. This <a href="http://www.sae.org/news/releases/05smfinal.htm">supermileage contes</a>t looks fun. I wonder if there is an opportunity to create some biodiesel version of this project. * The <a href="http://students.sae.org/chapters/choosecollege.htm">SAE website for college selection</a> has some good tips about programs. * <a href="http://www.kettering.edu/">Kettering University</a> -- formerly GMI – a highly regarded school, but Flint is tough duty. OK I haven’t been to Flint in 17 years, maybe it has improved. * Of course <a href="http://www.umich.edu">UM</a> has all kinds of programs – <a href="http://www.umtri.umich.edu/">Transportation Research</a>, <a href="http://arc.engin.umich.edu/">ARC</a> – but you have to cheer for the Wolverines and there are some lines I just can’t cross. OK full disclosure – I spent my freshman year in college at UM, I was a traitor to the state of Ohio, but I finally saw the light. * Down in NASCAR country, <a href="http://www.ces.clemson.edu/me/research/index.htm">Clemson</a> has a program. There must be other NASCAR state schools that have programs? * <a href="http://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/">Colorado State</a> from the SAE site is supposed to have a program of some sort. * The <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu/">art center college of design</a> in Pasadena has a program, more focused on aesthetics.</p>

Debugging the assembly of a high end machine with 2 SLI cards, 10K sata drives, raid arrays, fast dvd/cd drives – well it is just a lot easier to let the Falcon guys burn their time.</p>

    <p>I’ve upgraded to MT3.2 and decided to blow away all my templates in the process. Because they were old and funky and corrupted and it was just easier to start fresh. In fact I completely blew away my old blog, and reimported all my postings into this one. And just republished over the old one. I am sure there are old files left around from the old blog, that is probably good for google indexing and searching purposes.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks I’ll start selectively adding back features to the template like my Judy’s Book posts, Ohio State football status, blogroll, etc.</p>

    <p>* What is up with the speed limits in Oregon? Vast stretches of empty country in the eastern part of the state, and speed limits set at 65. No other state in the west is stuck back at this level. * I didn’t expect the bars in Salt Lake City to be so rockin’ on a Saturday night. They are wilder than Seattle bars. * Littering is illegal, but trucks are allowed to leave huge horking pieces of blown tires all over the highway? * The security at the parking garage at the Bellagio in LV was tighter than the security for driving over Hoover Dam. * Prescott is a very nice town. Has to be my favorite spot in Arizona so far. The granite dells are beautiful. * Phoenix on the other hand – LA, only hotter and without the ocean.</p>

    <p>Can’t wait for the season to start.</p>

<p>To put a little damper on my enthusiasm tho – <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005403.php">The buckeyes are already #3</a> – in football revenue. <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_05_01__arch_file.htm#111711545198246615">The Sports Economist points out</a> that expenditures don’t seem to correlate strongly with success though. But they don’t negatively correlate with success either.</p>

<p>Either way, about 85 kids are generating $46M in revenue for the school, which is getting used up to support other sports, build nice facilities, and pay some big salaries to adults. I still have a problem with the morality of this, more of the money should flow to the benefit of the players on the team. Some small suggestions – give the players 8 years of free tuition so that they can realistically get an education and play football. Or underwrite the tuition for the children of former players. Fund a modest disability insurance program for the players.</p>

<p>Anyway, kickoff is 17 days away…</p>

    <p>* “What’s My Name, Fool?”:amazon is a great collection of writings on sports by Dave Zirin. Zirin writes about the dirty underside of sports – the exploitation of poor uneducated young athletes; racism, sexism, and homophobia; the exploitation of sports by media and by politicians; the grotesque amounts of public monies spent on professional sports. Great great stuff. The histories of Ali, Jackie Robinson, Curt Flood, and others who fought for reform and for justice are illuminating. A very worthy read. * “Cheaper by the Dozen”:amazon – What a wonderful book. The father is an amazing character, the stories are fabulous. A very bittersweet ending, but that serves to make the story more human and authentic. Don’t know how I missed this growing up. * “The Ginger Man”:amazon by J P Donleavy – Horrid. Couldn’t finish. Brutish character, I learned nothing from him. The “Nicholas Baker”:amazon of 40 years ago – horrid little story that doesn’t need to be told. * “Gravity’s Rainbow”:amazon – A lot of interesting references and construction. But ultimately I didn’t care about anything happening in the book and put it down after 100 pages. If you want a farcical wartime book, read Catch-22. * “Keeping Watch”:amazon and “Folly”:amazon by Laurie R King. Wow, great pageturners. Great mysteries, great twists (especially keeping watch), really great characters who you care about. I like these much better than her period mysteries.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/08/14/hiking-on-lopez-island.html">Hiking on Lopez Island</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Just back from Lopez, great time. Some tips on hiking up there:</p>

<p>Stop by the chamber of commerce office in the village. Get their list of hikes and current directions – it is quite accurate. Many hikes on the island are on DNR land, accessible only by easement over private property – it can be a little tricky. The Chamber of Commerce directions are great.</p>

<p>The best hikes in my view:</p>

<p>* Shark reef. Short. But nice coastline and sealions. Very busy. * Otis Perkins Park. Go at low tide. A long expanse of beach. Probably safe to ignore private property signs. * Chadwick hill. Definitely need those instructions, accessing the trail head is tricky. No one goes here – Trail is rough, rough. But more vertical than most the trails on the island * Iceberg point. Again you need those instructions, tricky to find the trail. Not strenuous but a gorgeous piece of property, sealions, great views, some vertical gain. Lots of sun. This is the best on the island.</p>

    <p>Went up <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/images/Hiking/MTSI-072005.JPG">Mt Si</a> this week – first time ever. 4 miles one way, I think about 3200’ vertical gain. Gorgeous day and gorgeous spot. I think I still like Rattlesnake ledge better but this was beautiful.</p>

<p>Along the way, discovered my hiking boots weren’t all they could be. Upgraded to some <a href="http://www.asolo.com/">asolos</a>.</p>
