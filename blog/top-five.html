I have 1200+ books listed on Goodreads and I am sure there are another 500-1000 I’ve read that I have never put on Goodreads (for instance, I read every Allen Drury political drama back in my teens, loved them, but I’ve never bothered to put on Goodreads).

		<p>Bill Gates recently <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Holiday-Books-2022">posted some of his favorite books</a>.  And it has inspired me to think about my all time favorites.  I have 1200+ books listed on Goodreads and I am sure there are another 500-1000 I’ve read that I have never put on Goodreads (for instance, I read every Allen Drury political drama back in my teens, loved them, but I’ve never bothered to put on Goodreads).</p>

<p>I narrowed my list down to 6 with some alternates as well.  (Sorry I couldn’t get to 5, Bill is better at this than I am)</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/378.The_Phantom_Tollbooth">The Phantom Tollbooth</a> by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer.  This book hooked me on reading as a young reader, I loved the story and the wordplay.  It is probably not a great adult book read but I think it is fabulous for young readers.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17157681-the-hobbit-part-one">The Hobbit</a> is of course a great choice as well.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama">Rendezvous with Rama</a> by Arthur C. Clarke.  I read a ton of classic science fiction and I loved much of it.  Rama really had a sense of mystery and wonder that I enjoyed.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234225.Dune">Dune</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion">Hyperion</a> are great books in the genre as well.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423.The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness">The Left Hand of Darkness</a> by Ursula K. Leguin.  I love all of Leguin’s works, this book showed me that speculative fiction could be so much deeper.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334176.The_Sparrow">The Sparrow</a> is an excellent choice too.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1138543.The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England">The Strange Death of Liberal England</a> by George Dangerfield.  One of my favorite history books about a period of great change, just so well written. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1128055.Hitler_s_Thirty_Days_to_Power">Hitler’s Thirty Days to Power</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50159458-kent-state">Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio</a> are excellent choices as well.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262304.The_Wild_Party">The Wild Party</a> by Joseph Moncure March with illustrations by Art Spiegelman.  A quirky little piece of fiction that I find incredibly entertaining.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11149.The_Screwtape_Letters">The Screwtape Letters</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288259-dear-committee-members">Dear Committee Members</a> are fun choices too.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54218.The_Mismeasure_of_Man">The Mismeasure of Man</a> by Stephen Jay Gould.  All of Gould’s work is excellent, this set of analyses is well argued and well written.  Other good non-fiction choices are <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35187180-the-death-and-life-of-the-great-lakes">The Death and Life of the Great Lakes</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy">Good Strategy, Bad Strategy</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan">The Black Swan</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17884043-tune-in">Tune In</a>.</li>
