This is a great book. The story of a life-long relationship between a man suffering from random time travel events and his wife, and the effects that this situation has on their relationship. Just a wonderful story – great characters, a beautiful relationship. While time travel is a part of the story, the book doesn’t go over old time-travel ground but rather focuses on the relationship and how it evolves and develops. A great holiday gift.</p>

    <p>Needed some escapist reading and picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/193240709X/qid=1069866798//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/104-7738134-9854363?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: The Road to Armageddon">The Road to Armageddon</a> by Larry Collins based on a reco I read somewhere. What a piece of junk. Absolutely no style in his writing whatsoever. Nothing evocative at all. Uni-dimensional characters. Incredibly slow start. The pace picks up a little and I managed to get through the book but basically a piece of crap. Oh and a right-wing apologist theme all the way through; I am a little right of center myself but this was transparent and just plain painful to read. Even the binding on this book is crappy, like it came from a vanity press, not a commercial publisher.</p>

Camera phones are selling well because, well, it is hard to buy a phone without a camera now. It is like saying that modems must be really popular because every PC has one. I just don’t see the usage of camera phones growing at the same rate as their ubiquity – i don’t know that many people who have active moblogs, i don’t get that many pictures (well, i don’t get ANY) sent to me. Maybe I am in the wrong demographic. But to claim somehow that cameraphones are a more impactful consumer product than DVD players is just wrong – look at all the dvd sales, dvd rentals, dvd economic activity, and contrast that with the supporting activity around cameraphones. I can buy DVDs at my grocery store checkout now. I can’t do anything with my cameraphone at any retail outlet.</p>

What I need are higher performance disk subsystems – given the cheapness of disks and ram, i am surprised we aren’t seeing disks with even more cache, with smarter caches, and i am surprised we are not seeing consumer storage subsystems with data striped across multiple drives, thus getting multiple read heads working on our behalf. And I need more reliable storage – I want my data auto-replicated across multiple disks so I don’t have to worry about backup anymore. Where are the mass market products that address disk performance and data reliability?</p>

    <p>Here are a bunch of links to get you up to speed on the history of the OSU and Michigan rivalry. The Ann Arbor paper has a nice <a href="http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/football/rivalry.ssf">complete game-by-game countdown</a> tho with a Michigan bent of course. They also have a nice <a href="http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/aanews/football/index.ssf?/base/sports-0/1069260255116980.xml">interview with Bo</a> where he recollects some of the highlights. <a href="http://www.lib.ohio-state.edu/arvweb/OSUvsMichigan/games.htm">The OSU library</a> hosts a nice comparison site with some statistical highlights. And then a couple of lists of the best games ever, per <a href="http://news.ohiostatealumni.org/news/461547.html">OSU Alumni vote</a> and per the <a href="http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/11/22/spt_wwwsptfoot1tosuslist22.html">Cincinnati Enquirer</a>. For my money, the 1973 tie and the ensuing vote to send OSU to the Rose Bowl, surprising most of the state of Michigan, was the most dramatic game and outcome. I remember leaving the Big House totally deflated, thinking that the Buckeyes would be sitting at home. And then on the drive home, as the news came across the radio, our car and all the cars around us exploding with cheers and honks as the decision was announced.</p>
