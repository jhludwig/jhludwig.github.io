  <h1><a href="/2004/03/12/tired-of-fighting-spam-its-time-to-embrace-it.html">Tired of fighting spam -- it&#039;s time to embrace it</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I am tired of fighting spam. I have 4 different spam filters installed on email, they catch 99% of it, but it is still a pain to keep the filters up to date, check for false positives, etc.</p>

<p>So I decided Wednesday to quit fighting. I am just going to totally surrender to spam and take advantage of all these great opportunities in my inbox.</p>

<p>This is going to take some money. So first I took out 2 loans, and consolidated my existing debt to get my payments down. Nice little seed of cash flow. 3 spam down, and I have a nice little nest egg to work with.</p>

<p>But I really need to grow that money. So I took 1/3rd to an offshore casino – 1 cent slots with million dollar jackpots! And I invested 1/3rd in US Government Tax Certificates, whatever they are – 50% returns guaranteed! And then sent the last third to poor Mrs Mariam Abacha in Nigeria. From this last deal alone I’ll make $8M dollars! 6 spam down.</p>

<p>First off, I am going to focus on personal growth. I’m going to pick up that PhD I’ve been wanting – apparently I don’t need to deal with any annoying classes or thesis. I’ve signed up for that Sales training course. I’m going to stop smoking. I’m getting stars named after me and my whole family. And I’m promoting my blog, on two different services. 12 spam down.</p>

<p>After all this self improvement, I deserve a break. I’ve signed up for two vacations – a free weekend at a resort, and a cheap flight to Europe. I’m getting free cable tv installed. I just got a great price on Adobe Photoshop. I’ve signed up for an extended warranty on my car. 17 spam down.</p>

<p>But after all this selfish focus and rampant consumerism, I am filled with self-loathing. I’ve started smoking again, so I am going to pick up cigarettes for cheap by the carton. I buy two banned CDs the government doesn’t want me to see. I visit a great porn site, delivered privately to my home. 21 spam down.</p>

<p>My short dive into the seedier side has cleansed me – I am going to pursue a purer life with renewed enthusiasm. What has really been missing is love. I’ll accept offers for 3 different blind dates that apparently have been set up for me. I am quite optimistic, I order viagra online from 18 different services! And I order one batch of size enhancement pills. 43 spam down.</p>

<p>I’m headed out for a big evening. Quickly now, before I run – scan my PC for bugs and spyware that may have entered my system after opening all this spam. And then open 6 email worms so I can keep the email flow going for all of you.</p>

<p>All 50 spam dealt with. It really wasn’t that bad.</p>

Gosh was this boooooring.</p>

<p>The premise – start with a historical event, follow a set of ?six degrees of separation? links to a modern event, and show the strange connections along the way. I am sure this is a work of some scholarship. To research and find these connections is time consuming.</p>

<p>But so what. There is nothing causal about these chains. I know bill gates, he knows the premier of china, does that mean that I have any influence over the government/culture/society of china? No. Throw in 2 or 3 more degrees of separation and it is just absurd – my grandmother spent a night in the White House during the Harding administration, can we tie Harding to current events in China. And the stories in this book have 10-15 links, if you’ve played the ?six degrees? game at all, you see quickly how trivial it is to link anyone to anyone, there is nothing statistically surprising about these links.</p>

<p>The booh has 25 narratives of this form, I gave up on the 2nd. Worse than reading someone’s blog.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/03/03/economic-basis-of-open-source.html">Economic basis of open source</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Thanks to <a href="http://duhblog.com:8668/duhblog/space/2004-01-08#Readings_on_Open_Source" title="DUH BLOG :: 2004-01-08">DUH BLOG :: 2004-01-08</a>, I’ve been reading a paper by Yochai Benkler on the economic basis of open source development – Coase’s Penguin, or Linux and the Nature of the Firm by Yochai Benkler http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html . Very good stuff – the abstract: <em>For decades our understanding of economic production has been that individuals order their productive activities in one of two ways: either as employees in firms, following the directions of managers, or as individuals in markets, following price signals. This dichotomy was first identified in the early work of Nobel laureate Ronald Coase, and was developed most explicitly in the work of neo-institutional economist Oliver Williamson. In the past three or four years, public attention has focused on a fifteen-year-old social-economic phenomenon in the software development world. This phenomenon, called free software or open source software, involves thousands or even tens of thousands of programmers contributing to large and small scale project, where the central organizing principle is that the software remains free of most constraints on copying and use common to proprietary materials. No one “owns” the software in the traditional sense of being able to command how it is used or developed, or to control its disposition. The result is the emergence of a vibrant, innovative and productive collaboration, whose participants are not organized in firms and do not choose their projects in response to price signals. In this paper I explain that while free software is highly visible, it is in fact only one example of a much broader social-economic phenomenon. I suggest that we are seeing is the broad and deep emergence of a new, third mode of production in the digitally networked environment. I call this mode “commons-based peer-production,” to distinguish it from the property- and contract-based models of firms and markets. Its central characteristic is that groups of individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals, rather than either market prices or managerial commands.</em></p>
