				<p><p>Ok well the day arrived. I can’t quite figure out what the ipad is for. I still need to carry my iPhone for phone calls. I still need to carry my MacBook Pro for real software – Matlab, Mathematica, Aperture, LaTEX-heavy docs. I’ll still carry the Kindle for its awesome battery life. Would I carry the iPad as well??? Or are there occasional trips where I’d carry instead of the MacBook Pro?</p>

<p>Or maybe it is for the couch at home. But usually I again need to run real software. So what is this thing for?</p>

<p>So I only ordered one.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>* “Typhoon”:amazon by Charles Cumming. I really liked this tale, suspense set in China over the last 15 years, with some nicely shaded characters. Amazon says just 3.5 stars, but I’m at least 4 stars, I would pick up another book by the author in a heartbeat. * “Invisible”:amazon by Paul Auster. Quite a twisted little tale of a very evil and manipulative man working his way through a set of lives. And a very nice structure to the tale, raises the book above your typical mystery. I’ve had several Austers on the shelf for a while, very worth the time. Amazon says 4 stars, I’m good with that. * “The Private Patient”:amazon by P.D. James. This one feels to me like it is the dead zone between a good mystery yarn and literature. The author aspires to write a deeper more thoughtful tale but is just boring. Doubt I will finish. Amazon says 4 stars but really not close.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Just back from a stay in West Hollywood. Stayed at “Le Parc Suites”:http://www.leparcsuites.com/. I think this place had its best moments 10 years ago. Not terrible, the service levels were good, the street is nice, but the facility is aging and probably wasn’t great to start with.</p>

<p>From walking around, where we should have stayed (kitchen a requirement): * “Palihouse”:http://www.palihouse.com/suites.asp?st=5. Looks very cool and good kitchens. Not as nice a street location as Le Parc but looks way awesomer. * “Petit Ermitage”:http://www.petitermitage.com/home.php. Also full kitchens.</p>

<p>Close but lacking a real kitchen: * “LeMontrose Suite Hotel”:http://www.lemontrose.com/accommodations/amenities.php. Kitchenette type facilities * “Chamberlain”:http://www.chamberlainwesthollywood.com/accommodations/index.html. Kitchenette as well in some rooms</p>

				<p><p>OK the missteps that Google has made with Buzz this week are well chronicled. They jammed a product out without really thinking it through.</p>

<p>That doesn’t hit me that much as a user. But today using the iphone map app I am getting continuous errors – here is the map of “drugstores near my current location”:http://twitpic.com/13st7z. Not unique to me, I’ve heard of this from many folks today.</p>

<p>And I’m looking at the ESPN boxscore page for “Purdue/OSU right now”:http://espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=300480194 and first the google toolbar tells me it is in Portuguese, and now in Catalan, and asks if I want a translation.</p>

<p>One wonders if Google is spreading itself a little thin.</p>

				<p><p>* “Freedom(TM)”:amazon by Daniel Suarez. Not as mind-wreckingly good as his prior, “Daemon”:amazon but a very nice conclusion to the tale. 3.5 stars, Amazon says 4.5 stars but that I think is carryover from the first book. * “Give Me Liberty”:amazon by Naomi Wolf. Nice nonfiction complement to the above. Does a nice job of illustrating how our rights have been eroded, and admonishing us to do something about. Amazon says 4.5 stars, well, it is a fine book, but I’d stop at 3.5 * “Judas Unchained”:amazon by Peter Hamilton. Vaguely remember the prior book but it has been a while and this book does not stand alone. Amazon says 4 stars, I am hard on books today, I’d say 3 stars * “The Forgotten Man”:amazon by Amity Shlaes. History of the Depression, interesting although some of the details could have been left to an appendix. Roosevelt’s level of power was amazing. The story of the transformation of government into a very active role is told well and is clearly not an unalloyed good. The abject failure of monetary policy is well told and a good lesson for today. And my impression of Hoover from high school history as a total bumbler changed, he was incredibly competent prior to his stint as president. Amazon says 4 stars, I’ll say 3.5, and with tighter editing could have been a 4.</p>

				<p><p>OK so Amazon’s “move against Macmillan”:http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/02/01/all-the-many-ways-amazon-so-very-failed-the-weekend/ was seriously ham-handed and Amazon is “still caught up in their own undershorts”:http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/02/01/seriously-now-theyre-just-being-dicks/. Some Amazonians deserve some serious reprimands, this is just not the way these things are handled. Now Amazon has created even more problems for itself.</p>

<p>That said – we are talking about 4-5 days of inconvenience Amazon has caused readers and authors. Stupid but fixable.</p>

<p>As “Charles points out”:http://www.platformonomics.com/PricelessIndeed.aspx, Macmillan is trying to put the screws to all of us big time and for the long run. They are grabbing for more dollars out of out pockets at a time when book costs are heading down. Now, if Macmillan was passing all this on to authors, I might be OK with it, but I suspect it is being absorbed by a bunch of corporate suits.</p>

<p>Who is our real friend here? Shame on Amazon for being so clumsy, but greater shame on Macmillan.</p>
