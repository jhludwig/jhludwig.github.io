				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/the-bcs-needs-an-agenda">The BCS needs an agenda</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">17 December 2009</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK I don’t love the <a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org">BCS</a> but I am not a college football playoff nut either. College basketball is great in March but the rest of the season has been sapped of its vitality and that would be terrible for football.</p>

<p>The BCS has been made the bad guy in all these and they just sit back and let themselves get hammered, trying only the <a href="http://twitter.com/insidethebcs">most pathetic PR response</a>. Hiring a fancy PR firm, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/305270-bcs-at-it-again-bcs-plants-bombard-espns-playoff-piece">which the BCS has done</a>, isn’t going to help. No amount of spit and polish is going to make a crappy message look better.</p>

<p>The <strong>BCS needs to quit letting others set the agenda and needs to go on the offensive with their own agenda</strong>. Here is one proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the real problem with the matchups created this season in the BCS bowls? No one knows how to evaluate all the unbeatens – is an unbeaten TCU better or worse than Cincy or Texas or Boise or ? And are they really better than any 1-loss teams out there?</li>
  <li>We don’t know how to evaluate these teams because the regular season is a failure – there is little/no meaningful cross-conference play. Imagine if TCU had had to play a couple SEC teams or Cincy a couple Big-12 teams and so on. Meaningful interconference play during the season would help bowl seeding dramatically.</li>
  <li>The NCAA let schools add a 12th game to their seasons a few years back – and rather than adding meaning interconference play, everyone has gone on a cupcake search. These games have added nothing to the quality of the sport. These games could and should be replaced with something more meaningful.</li>
  <li>The idea then: grab the 12th game back. Ask all schools to hold a weekend in mid-October open. At the end of the previous weekend’s play, seed all the FCS teams into meaningful interconference games. And have a grand mid-season interconference weekend full of meaningful games.</li>
  <li>This would bring a level of excitement to the sport in October that would be unprecedented. A weekend of great games. The excitement of seeding announcements the weekend before. It would be an event on the scale of March Madness but unique to football in structure. It would be like a midseason Bowl season.</li>
  <li>We would hold off creating BCS ratings until after this weekend so that the ratings can benefit from the information learned in this weekend.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than sitting back passively and being blamed as the bad guy ruining the sport, the BCS could go on the offensive with a proposal that would materially improve the sport. And it would maintain the character and history of the bowls, while improving the postseason matchups.</p>

<p>There are many ways the mid-season seeding could happen and there is no need to get caught up in our undershorts of any one system. A proposal below but the exact form doesn’t matter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pick a weekend 6 weeks into the season – halfway point. All schools hold the weekend free for a game to be scheduled, and they agree to provide a playing facility every other year. Gate will be evenly split between schools, no one should care where a game is played. There is a debate to be had about games played on campus or at neutral sites, I have no strong position, there are good arguments for either.</li>
  <li>Scheduling is done completely blind of any rankings, human or computer. All that is considered is FBS conference rankings up to that point in the season.</li>
  <li>Conference standings are split in half – upper and lower. If you are in upper half, you will play an FBS team in the upper half of another FBS conference. Lower half, then opponent in lower half of another FBS conference. Seeding happens within these halves then.</li>
  <li>Unaffiliated teams are grouped with existing conferences for this exercise. ND with Big10, Navy and Army with BigEast, etc. A best estimate made of where they would rank in conference standing.</li>
  <li>The out-of-conference lineup rotates each year according to a known schedule.</li>
</ul>

<p>So applied to this year’s Big10 standings (approximate midyear , based on memory):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Iowa Plays a 6 seed from Pac10</li>
  <li>PSU plays a 5 seed from Mountain West</li>
  <li>OSU plays a 4 seed from WAC</li>
  <li>Wisconsin plays a 3 seed from Sun Belt</li>
  <li>MSU plays a 2 seed from Big12</li>
  <li>Notre Dame plays a 1 seed from CUSA</li>
  <li>Northwestern plays a 12 seed from MAC</li>
  <li>Minnesota plays an 11 seed from SEC</li>
  <li>Purdue plays a 10 seed from Big East</li>
  <li>Indiana plays a 9 seed from the ACC</li>
  <li>Illinois plays an 8 seed from the Pac10</li>
  <li>Michigan plays a 7 seed from the Mountain West</li>
</ul>

<p>The conferences were just listed arbitrarily west to east. The next year they would rotate so you get a mix of seeds from conferences every year.</p>

<p>This system doesn’t screw up conference standings, in fact in <strong>reinforces the conference games</strong> as conference standing impacts seeding. It <strong>doesn’t screw up bowl affiliations, bowl economics, bowl season</strong>. It <strong>doesn’t screw up BCS participation</strong> except for at-large teams, and it can only improve the quality of selection. It <strong>creates a huge amount of midyear excitement</strong>, almost a 2nd bowl season. And it is <strong>scalable</strong> -- if only 3 conferences want to participate at first, fine, do it with just 3.</p>

<p>OK so there are a ton of details to work out but the core is this – the <strong>BCS needs to create a positive agenda and get out of their reactive position, and there is plenty of opportunity to improve the regular season</strong>.</p>
</p>

				<p><p>* “Under the Dome”:amazon by Stephen King. An impermeable dome settles over a New England town, and Lord of the Flies/Kristallnacht ensues. No supernatural baddies here, just ill-behaved humans. Ultimately there is a supernatural cause for the dome, but all the real evil in the book is 100% human in origin. Somewhat entertaining but very very long. Amazon says 3.5 stars, a shorter crisper version might have warranted more.</p>

<p>* “Asterios Polyp”:amazon by David Mazzucchelli. A very grown up graphic novel. Asterios lives a self-absorbed life, but late in life starts to reflect on his path and what he really values. A very compelling tale. Super easy to get through but packed with insight. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I’m good with that.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">16 December 2009</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Blogs and tweets galore today about <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=4745381">Big 10 expansion</a> – the discussion all centering on who should be the 12th team, particularly if not ND?</p>

<p>I’m not in love with the idea of expansion, but if it is going to happen…it is all about money. If ND won’t join in, no single other school will make a real contribution to TV viewership. So why stop at 12 teams? Pick up 3 or 5 and really increase TV footprint. Again assuming ND won’t play:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If 3, go after Rutgers, BC, Syracuse. Good schools, pick up major East Coast interest. BC can’t be that committed to the ACC. Syracuse is a great bball program and can be a great football program. Rutgers is the weakest but the potential TV market is huge. And this expansion would be big big news and would drive interest.</li>
  <li>If 5, add in Pitt for sure. Not thrilled about WVU as the last add, no population base for TV or recruiting. What about UConn?</li>
</ul>

<p>These would be dramatic moves but if the Big10 wants to grab the spotlight again, a one team expansion of someone besides ND is just not going to do it. It is a “me too” move and pretty boring.</p>

<p>OK two more crazy ideas, but in the vein of “let’s get the spotlight of football back on the Big 1o”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 2 weekend playoff at end of season. Trim off one game from 12-game schedule, have two play-in games from the top 4 teams. Pair up everyone else in seed order for a final 12th game.</li>
  <li>Heck with eastern expansion, merge with the Pac-10. The Pac-10 tv offering sucks, the BTEN network could pick up all the Pac-10 content and Pac-10 footprint.</li>
</ul>

<p>Point being, if you can’t get ND, don’t screw around with half-measures. Go big or go home.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">16 December 2009</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Tim motivated me to look over all the books I’ve read in the last 6 months. Some great ones and some dreck. The ones I am glad I read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“The Road”:amazon by Cormac McCarthy. Brutal, spartan. Viggo is the right man for the role.</li>
  <li>“The Chatham School Affair”:amazon by Thomas H. Cook. A nice little tale of small town adultery and how it rips apart the lives around it. Edgar Award winner tho certainly not structured like a typical mystery. Hard to find.</li>
  <li>“The Power Of Myth”:amazon by Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyers. Classic book about some of the deep issues of life and humanity.</li>
  <li>“QED”:amazon by Richard P. Feynman. Simple (to the degree that anything quantum can be simple) explanation of the basics of quantum electrodynamics.</li>
  <li>“The Post-American World”:amazon by Fareed Zakaria. A little dated by financial events but still good.</li>
  <li>“Consider Phlebas”:amazon by Iain M. Banks. Seemingly a space opera but actually a thoughtful book about humanity, the futility of war. Must read the epilog.</li>
  <li>“The Tourist”:amazon by Olen Steinhauer. Excellent tale of a CIA agent dealing with betrayal at many levels and his own secrets. Emotionally crushing ending.</li>
  <li>“Await Your Reply”:amazon by Dan Choan. Strange tale of a serial ID thief trying to find a life for himself.</li>
  <li>“In Pale Battalions”:amazon by Robert Goddard. A woman gradually discovers the truths about her family and background – the cruelty and crimes during WWI which defined her life.</li>
  <li>“Julian Comstock: A Story of 22nd-Century America”:amazon by Robert Charles Wilson. Excellent tale of post-apocolyptic America. Classic tragedy themes narrated in a folksy Twainish style.</li>
  <li>“The Only Three Questions That Count”:amazon by Ken Fisher. One successful investor’s view on how to invest. The discussion on national debt levels alone is worth the book.</li>
</ul>

<p>Books I wish I hadn’t bought: Air by Geoff Ryman, The Manual of Detection by Jedediah Barry, Third Degree by Greg Iles, T is for Trespass by Sue Grafton, The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil. All bad in their own way.</p>

				<p><p>Hurray, got the mail from the ticket office today, we’ll be there. Not like it was hard to get them – apparently the alums didn’t snap up all the tix as there will be a <a href="http://blog.dispatch.com/buckeyesblog/2009/12/public_sale_for_rose_bowl_tick.shtml">public sale</a>.</p>

<p>As Rose Bowl prep, some reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.thebuckeyebattlecry.com/?p=3936">nice primer on Rose Bowl and bowl system history</a>. There is no NCAA football championship, the bowls are not about a championship. Important to remember as we get into the silly season now with everyone gnashing and wailing about the BCS.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/64318">Bowl gifts</a>. Pretty standardized across all the games at this point.</li>
  <li>OSU 7-0 all time against Oregon, yay!</li>
  <li>But the <a href="http://blog.blockonation.com/2009/12/2010-rose-bowlohio-state-vs-oregon.html">Oregon trolls are out in force in the comments here</a></li>
  <li>The Rose Bowl is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ducks_bowl_game_history">pretty rarefied air for Oregon</a> – their usual destinations are El Paso, San Diego, Las Vegas, etc.  Welcome to the big time.</li>

				<p><p>OK somehow I have managed to jam a few books into the last month despite all the other things going on.  I will say this, time pressure makes me a little more selective.</p>

<p>* “The Road”:amazon by Cormac McCarthy. Boy I’m late to this one. Brutal, spartan tale. Touching but deeply sad. Going to be the feelgood movie of the holiday season! Viggo is the right guy for this role.</p>

<p>* “The Chatham School Affair”:amazon by Thomas H. Cook. A nice little tale of small town adultery and how it rips apart the lives around it. Depths of darkness here, and some unexpected twists. An Edgar Award winner tho certainly not structured like a typical mystery, probably will appeal to more types of readers. Amazon says 4 stars, I’d say 4.5, this one will stick with me for a while. Surprisingly hard to find – this is why the retail bookstores are in trouble, too much crap on the racks, not enough of this kind of book.</p>

<p>* “Air”:amazon by Geoff Ryman. A small town in Central Asia is brought forcefully into the information age. Highly recommended, award-winning but blah, just doesn’t click for me. Not terrible but just uninteresting. Maybe deeper in the story ramps up but I gave up after 50 pages. Amazon gives 4 stars but I can’t give it more than one.</p>

<p>* “Consider Phlebas”:amazon by Iain M. Banks. His first? Culture novel about a far distant future. Seemingly a space opera but actually a thoughtful book about humanity, the futility of war. Better than I first thought. The epilog to the tale really ties it together. Amazon says 4 stars, this seems right.</p>

				<p><p>While this weekend’s victory over Michigan was not one for the ages, it does cap another great Buckeye season. Undisputed Big10 champs, 5 straight Big10 titles, Rose Bowl trip, 5th straight BCS bowl, 6th straight victory over Michigan, undefeated November including wins over other title contenders. It is a good era to be a Buckeye fan. Tresselball is alive and well despite <a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/blog/dr_saturday/post/Deconstructing-The-grisly-demise-of-Tressel-Ba?urn=ncaaf,189322">opinions to the contrary</a> – I am very happy winning games with a tough defense, special teams play (tho this has not been as strong this year), and mistake-free offense. Some writers want to see a lot of “style” points, but that is not football. If you value style points, go watch ice dancing or diving – fine sports, nothing wrong with them. I don’t watch football for style points.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.thebuckeyebattlecry.com/?p=3399">throwback unis looked good</a> and it is super to commemorate the ‘54 team – congrats Dad.</p>

<p>For Michigan, wow, another terrible season. The fan base is failing as well – the amount of scarlet in the Big House was astounding. <a href="http://www.maizenbrew.com/2009/11/23/1170281/lost">Real Michigan fans are pissed about</a>.  For the sake of the rivalry, I hope that Michigan starts to be relevant and credible again. I admit to having the thought that, if there was any year in which the pain of losing to Michigan would be small, this might have been it, and it would have been good for the rivalry. The wolverines weren’t up to it.</p>

<p>Also watched a lot of PAC 10 action. With USC caught up in its own undershorts, the Pac-10 is a mess. Stanford opted out this weekend. Arizona opted out. Oregon-Oregon State for all the marbles? When has that ever been the case in the past? The collapse of USC is like the death of Tito, with the Pac-10 fracturing like Yugoslavia into a bunch of warring factions, none dominant.</p>
