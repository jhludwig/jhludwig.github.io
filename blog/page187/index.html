			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I’m trying to find a good KVM with Audio for home use. I’ve started with this – <a href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&amp;Section_Id=201729&amp;pcount=&amp;Product_Id=160623" title="Welcome to Belkin - OmniView™ SOHO Series KVM Switch with Audio, USB and VGA">Belkin OmniView SOHO Series KVM Switch with Audio, USB and VGA</a> – and while it works largely as promised, it has some real drawbacks. The video and audio switching are fine. But the keyboard/mouse/usb switching is troubled – the box is basically a USB 1.x hub which is switched back and forth between machines. And this creates some problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is usb 1.x and not usb 2.0 which creates all kinds of annoying error messages because I have downstream usb 2.0 devices.</li>
  <li>the usb hub introduces latency in kb/mouse interactions which is at time noticeable in games.</li>
  <li>the hub just plain drops some kb input – for instance if you hold down the control key for more than 5 seconds, the hub forgets. really bad if you are trying to select a lot of messages in your inbox for instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>So i can’t recommend this box. I may try the PS2 model and see if it improves the latency and keyboard problems – it may since i think the ps2 switching is just an electrical switching and doesn’t try to get fancy with a usb hub. What I’d really like tho is a usb2.0 based kvm with low latency and no keyboard drops. Google points toward some <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=usb+2.0+kvm">usb2.0 kvms</a> but they don’t have audio. Maybe i should just get one of these kvms and have a separate switch for audio?</p>

<p>Training XP to use a SATA drive as a boot drive was a little tricky – involving:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing a SATA PCI card – I had a maxtor (promise-based) card that came free with another hard drive so I used that. Installed fine, tho XP has no drivers for it, but the drivers on the CD were certified</li>
  <li>Connecting up the WD drive. This was confusing. The drive end of the SATA cable was a 15 pin power-carrying connector, and the documentation warned many times about NOT connecting the standard 4-pin drive power connector if you were using a 15-pin connector. However, on the PCI card end, the SATA cable was data-only, and it was clearly not delivering power to the drive. I wasted time here until I finally just connected a spare 4-pin drive power connector and everything worked</li>
  <li>Getting confused by XP, which was looking for some Promise SATA driver, but finally just ignoring this error message after reading some forums which said it was harmless</li>
  <li>Running the included WD utilities to copy all my files from my old IDE boot drive over to the SATA drive, and setting the SATA drive to be a boot drive.</li>
  <li>But of course the utility didn’t really set the SATA drive up to be a boot drive, you have to muck around in the BIOS to do that, enabling SCSI boot as SATA masquerades as SCSI at this level of the system</li>
</ul>

<p>But it all works now and it is great!</p>

Wow it makes a huge difference, I am very happy!</p>

				<p><p>We’ve played a lot of games over the holiday. Our grades:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.callofduty.com/index.asp" title="Activision: Call Of Duty">Call Of Duty</a>: A+. Multiplayer incredibly fun, servers easy to connect to, firewalls not a problem. The only real beef is the stupid bunny-hopping behaviour that some players adopt to avoid incoming fire.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Counterstrike</a>: A-. Great multiplayer gameplay. But aged graphics, ridiculously painful downloading required to get up and going, and confusing game lobby behaviour.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/">Halo for PC</a>. B+. Fun, not a bad way to spend time. But just doesn’t seem to have the same addictiveness of Call of Duty or Counterstrike.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.easportsbig.com/games/ssx3/home.jsp">SSX 3</a>. B+. OK we are suckers for snowboarding games. This is a reasonable next version of the SSX line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.xiii-thegame.com/uk/virtualtour/">XIII</a>. C+. A great idea and a good story line. But incredibly stupid save game behaviour makes the single player missions painful – needless repetition of solved missions is no substitute for real challenge. Oh and the end of level bosses are juvenile, making the game feel like a Mario title.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hidden-and-dangerous.com/hd2/index.aspx?bhcp=1">Hidden and Dangerous 2</a>. C-. A nice looking game, but so realistic that the fun is sapped out of it. Yes I am sure a single shot from that gun would really take me out of commission, but a fun game needs to be a little more forgiving.</p>
