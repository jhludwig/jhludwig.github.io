Obviously homes don’t need enterprise-quality SCM but I think we would all agree – finding and managing vendors and service providers for the home is a PITA. Maybe I am just the worst records manager in the world, but when my garage door opener died recently, it was a major effort to find the piece of paper with the installer’s name from 5 years ago. And when you sell a home, all that info generally is lost.</p>

<p>It would be cool if, at the neighborhood level, we could all easily share referrals on service providers, see comments, etc.</p>

				<p><p>I’ve wanted to try this for a while – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001046.html" title="a little ludwig goes a long way: HP DVD Movie Writer again">a little ludwig goes a long way: HP DVD Movie Writer</a> – and so finally bought one and tried it out.</p>

<p>Net impression – I am a little disappointed. This is basically a usb-attached dvd burner with some bundled software. It has a few features to automate the transfer of a vhs tape to dvd – notably a bundled set of video in ports. But I was under the impression that a PC was hardly needed to transfer VHS tapes to DVD – the <a href="http://h30015.www3.hp.com/hp_dec/products/dvd_movie_writer.asp">hp site</a> says <em>“Transfer your home video to long-lasting DVDs … all without additional hardware or software.”</em> and <em>“Transfer, edit and preserve your home video ? even print DVD case covers ? with one easy-to-use device.”</em> and <em>“automatic, unattended conversion of your home movies”</em>.</p>

<p>Well that is all a little over the top. The device is non-functional without an attached PC driving it. And you have to interact a lot with the “Wizard” to get it to capture your tapes. And I am pretty sure you need at least two other devices – a pc and a printer – to print the dvd case covers. The bundled software is the normal set of bundled shlock you will find with a PC or dvd burner these days. Perhaps slightly more automated but the same basic crud.</p>

<p>Now, it did create playable DVDs which is something, this can be hard to do. I didn’t create a single coaster. So I guess it got some things right. But nowhere near as automated and trouble-free as implied.</p>

It is the most mission-critical piece of technology in our house, if I screw it up, I will catch a raft of shit. I can screw up printers, servers, individual PCs, DVD players, whatever, and generally the crowd will be tolerant. But if I screw up Tivo, I am sleeping on the couch.</td>

				<p><p>I’m curious to know what I can do with my Cisco ATA Voip interface box provided by Vonage. <a href="http://www.djernes.org/~shawn/ata186.htm" title="Asterisk">Shawn Djernes</a> has a little how-to on getting to the web interface, tho I am worried that Vonage has password-protected it. Here’s a <a href="http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/5PP0G0K75U.html">hack from last year</a> that might let me in, I don’t know what firmware I have tho. Anyone have any recos on how to look into the box?</p>

<p>Update: some more good links over on dslreports like <a href="http://www.iconnecthere.com/nonmembers/eng/accessories/accessories_ata.html">this guide to configuring the cisco ata186</a>.</p>

<p>Well dang, none of these work, because they are all specific to version 2.14 or lower of the firmware and i am on version 2.16. Still digging…</p>

<p>Update: the cisco site has some more <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/gatecont/ps514/products_configuration_example09186a00800c3a50.shtml">documentation on</a>…seems like maybe i should try accessing the device thru the IVR and perhaps opening up the device for web config.</p>
