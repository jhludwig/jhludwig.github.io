      <td>PVRblog”) – I just got HD service turned on and man would I love this box. My cable settop box looks exactly like this one but is model number 6200 instead of 6208. It doesn’t seem to have any PVR functions which is a bummer. Do any other Seattle-area Comcast customers seem to have PVR functionality with their box?</td>

Personally I have quit buying laptops because a) their price/performance is dreadful compared to desktops; b) they suck for playing games; c) i don’t really want to haul all my data around all the time, i want it to be ubiquitously available (kevin’s server idea); d) they are fragile as hell and expensive to keep running; e) my blackberry is good enough for computing when i am out and about. I can see buying a super-blackberry that can do more, but I will never go back to a laptop.</p>
