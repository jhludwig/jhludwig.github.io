	<title>Shared Browsing. I have been – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="Shared Browsing. I have been using the Application Sharing feature of MSN Messenger a lot recently. It is a great homework and college app tool, we can sit together and look at online apps, or at various homework searches. But there are some things I hate about it. A, it is such overkill. Tons of code loads and then the entire app window gets scraped, rendered into some protocol, and sent remotely, where a ton of code on the other machine receives and rerenders. B, it is so squirelly. All kinds of paint problems on the receiving end – Windows just doesn’t seem that happy with this crazy idea. C, the interface is absolutely unintelligible. I only understand it because, well, I used to manage the team. My kids think it is the goofiest software. I can’t even imagine explaining it to my dad.

		<p><strong>Shared Browsing</strong>. I have been using the Application Sharing feature of MSN Messenger a lot recently. It is a great homework and college app tool, we can sit together and look at online apps, or at various homework searches. But there are some things I hate about it. A, it is such overkill. Tons of code loads and then the entire app window gets scraped, rendered into some protocol, and sent remotely, where a ton of code on the other machine receives and rerenders. B, it is so squirelly. All kinds of paint problems on the receiving end – Windows just doesn’t seem that happy with this crazy idea. C, the interface is absolutely unintelligible. I only understand it because, well, I used to manage the team. My kids think it is the goofiest software. I can’t even imagine explaining it to my dad.</p>

<p>I’d like a simpler, lighter-weight solution. The data I really need to pass between machines is just the URL, cookie data, and some SSL data i think. Looking for solutions on the web – <a href="http://www.ezwebcar.com/Faq.asp#Co-Browsing">ezWebCar</a> -- hmm doesn’t handle ssl, maybe for good reasons. But makes it useless for college apps. <a href="http://www.talisma.com/products/browsing.asp">Talisma</a> has a product which handles SSL but seems enterprise focused. There are other enterprise focused solutions floating around too like Wicom. Then there are classroom focused solutions like <a href="http://www.webwisdom.com/Products/vclassroom.html">webwisdom</a>. But way heavier than I need.</p>

<p>Maybe I should go lower-tech and just use a combo of <a href="http://www.42u.com/video_splitters.htm">KVM boxes and splitters</a> to share the screen. Probably would be more robust than all the software solutions.</p>
