				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">10 June 2003</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Pings are working again from my blog, I had a rocky week this week. I upgraded to Windows Server 2003 last week – why? Well, it just seemed like a fun thing to do. Plus I know how fast Microsoft dev resources migrate away from old platforms to the new platform, if you want great ongoing help and support you need to bite the bullet and run the latest stuff.</p>

<p>But the upgrade initially hosed me. The IPSEC service failed to load with a really vague error message, and when IPSEC doesn’t load it takes the machine off net. You can turn IPSEC off, but critical services like DNS Client depend on it. For a week I limped along with IPSEC off, and my web server worked, but the machine couldn’t do any client name resolution (among other problems) and so trying to ping DNS names didn’t work.</p>

<p>Thanks to the responsiveness of guys at Microsoft – Dave, Jawad, Stephen, Raymond, David, Osman, and more – we got it figured out. I had installed <a href="http://www.diamondcs.com.au">Port Explorer beta</a> a long time ago and had quit using it. But it installs Winsock providers and these were hanging around on my system – we discovered these by using the sporder.exe tool from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/">windows platform sdk</a>. On an upgrade to WinServer2003, these make IPSEC unhappy, it refuses to load, and things go to sh%t.</p>

<p>Once I uninstalled Port Explorer, things righted themselves.</p>

<p>I tried to use the online Microsoft support options to get this resolved – the KB, the support forums – but there was no info about, and the folks in the support forum just told me to reinstall. Thankfully the dev teams at Microsoft were super responsive. Thanks much guys!</p>

				<p><p>OK after a pretty rocky week things should largely be working again on the site. Notably comments should be working, and my server should be pinging all the appropriate sites again.</p>

<p>Comments weren’t working because I had security cranked up on some directories which made it hard for anonymous users to force archive page regeneration when they posted a comment. I relaxed some settings and this should work now. I am not totally happy with the relaxed settings but decided I needed comments and trackback listings to work right. I may make more modifications here in the future.</p>

<p>We ate at a premier seafood restaurant in Seattle last night and it was hard to get non-farmed salmon. Out of about 9 salmon dishes, only one was line-caught. Sad. And the menu totally obscures this by calling the farm-raised salmon “Pacific Northwest Salmon” on all the dishes – you have to ask a lot of questions to find out that this is == farm raised Atlantic salmon from farms in BC.</p>

<p>One big problem area tho is that I get a really poor experience with Exchange2k Outlook Web Access pages; it could be the server deciding that I am an unsupported client and sending me highly defeatured pages. OWA pages with IE make heavy use of DHTML and so I suspect the exchange server is picky about what clients it supports fully.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>From my Dad – a great one!</p>

<p>In Tennessee, a guy sees a sign in front of a house: “Talking Dog for Sale.”</p>

<p>He rings the bell and the owner tells him the dog is in the backyard. The guy goes into the backyard and sees a black mutt just sitting there. “You talk?” he asks.</p>

<p>“Yep,” the mutt replies.</p>

<p>“So, what’s your story?”</p>

<p>The mutt looks up and says, “Well, I discovered this gift pretty young and I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA about my gift, and in no time they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies eight years running.”</p>

<p>“The jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn’t getting any younger and I wanted to settle down. So I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals. Had a wife, a mess of puppies, and now I’m just retired.”</p>

<p>The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.</p>

<p>The owner says, “Ten dollars.”</p>

<p>The guy says, “This dog is amazing. Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?”</p>

<p>The owner replies, “He’s such a liar. He didn’t do any of that shit.”</p>

				<p><p>Hey <a href="http://blog.neoteny.com/nakajima/archives/005511.html" title="Satoshi's Wireless Weblog: User Interface is an Art: Harmony Remote">Satoshi</a> have you tried the Harmony web interface? It is actually amazingly good, it wasn’t hard to use or understand at all.</p>

<p>Now I agree that we can do so much better…all my devices should broadcast their ids using some RF scheme, so that my remote can learn about them dynamically and reconfigure itself on the fly. But the harmony is pretty good, my family is way happier with it than with any previous universal remote.</p>
