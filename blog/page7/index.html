    <p>In this year’s battle of one-off kitchen tools: The <a href="http://www.slotdog.com/">SlotDog</a> kind of smashes your hotdog, but it does seem to work, the hotdogs are attractive and tasty. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watermelon-Slicer-Corer-Server-STAINLESS/dp/B01AV1WVNG">watermelon slicer</a> is pretty erratic, it mostly just smashes your watermelon and produces a lot of oddly shaped pieces and juice. A sharp knife is a much better tool.</p>

    <p>Nat, sharp as ever. One of the reasons we started Surround.io was to take advantage of the Moore’s Law driven wave of sensing technology. Since sensors are just carved out of silicon now, using the same process technology as digital electronics, sensors (cameras, accelerometers, mics, etc) are increasingly ubiquitous, cheap, and powerful. The challenge is software to process the flood of data.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2016/08/05/hey-john-how-do-you-decide-what-books-to-read.html">"Hey John, how do you decide what books to read?"</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I was asked this recently. I draw from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/section/books?action=click&amp;contentCollection=arts&amp;region=navbar&amp;module=collectionsnav&amp;pagetype=sectionfront&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">NYTimes Sunday Book Reviews</a>. I especially enjoy the “By The Book” column, in which a living author talks about what they have read and are reading. Always some things off the beaten path there.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/reviews/">LA Times</a> book reviews are useful as well.</li>
  <li>Various prize lists – Hugo, Nebula, Man Booker, Pulitzer, Nobel, Edgar. Tho I have found the Nobel prize winners to be rough rough going.</li>
  <li>Goodreads reviews and Amazon reviews. If a book doesn’t get great consensus reviews (or at least a strong positive rating from a subset of readers), I probably won’t read.</li>
  <li>I have a couple coworkers/friends who are big readers and I listen to their recos, and my college roommate is a voracious and critical reader, and I listen to him. And then anything that a family member recommends, I will consider.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will read just about any genre with a couple limitations. I find most popular business books to be horrible – 1 or 2 good ideas that are worthy of an article, but nothing worthy of a book. And I do not enjoy farce in any genre, just not my thing.</p>

Not your regular atlas, each entry is a little historical vignette about the island – shipwrecks, nuclear tests, settlement, abandonment, hope, loss. Tristan da Cunha really grabbed me for some reason.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unruly-Places-Spaces-Inscrutable-Geographies/dp/054410157X">Unruly Places</a> by <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/recent-books-unruly-places-the-rook-dispatches-from-pluto-dog-stars-pamuk-niceville/pluto/"><img src="images/pluto.jpg" alt="pluto" /></a>Alastair Bonnett. The stories behind some of the most unusual and unlikely places on the globe – places belonging to no nation, to many nations, floating, underground, in the sky – and an understanding of the meaning and importance of place.  Enjoyable.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rook-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316098809">The Rook</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stiletto-Novel-Files-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316228044">Stiletto</a> by Daniel O’Malley. Great suspenseful adventure in a world filled with magic –  kind of a grown-up Harry Potter milieu.  The first page grabs you – the protagonist awakens with no memory, in a park surrounded by bodies, and in her pocket is a note that says “Read Me”. Stiletto isn’t quite as strong but still a fund read.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dispatches-Pluto-Found-Mississippi-Delta-ebook/dp/B00UDCNM82">Dispatches From Pluto</a> by Richard Grant. An English adventure writer decides to settle in the Mississippi Delta. Interesting look at the culture and issues of a part of the country that seems almost foreign to me.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Stars-Peter-Heller-ebook/dp/B007GZELF2">The Dog Stars</a> by Peter Heller. A different kind of post-apocalyptic novel, the world has largely been emptied out, a very few people try to find their way and remain human.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangeness-my-Mind-novel-ebook/dp/B00SPVZA4C">A Strangeness In My Mind</a> by Orhan Pamuk. Tried to lift my literary sights, but as always, “Nobel Prize Winning” does not equal “interesting”.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Niceville-Trilogy-Vintage-Crime-Lizard/dp/030774535X">Niceville</a> by Carsten Stroud. Not a nice place. Solid horror/mystery.</li>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Season-Broken-Earth/dp/0316229296">The Fifth Season</a> by N. K. Jemison. A small set of related characters finding their way on a far-future(?) Earth peopled by humans and human derivatives, littered with the artifacts of past civilizations, undergoing yet another seismic/volcanic reshaping. Of course there is some conspiracy at work. Good tale, characters dealing with painful issues.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/06/recent-books-29/connectography/"><img src="images/connectography.jpg" alt="connectography" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Connectography-Mapping-Future-Global-Civilization/dp/0812988558">Connectography</a> by Parag Khanna. How the world is moving beyond nation-states to clusters driven by interconnectivity. Well written and a lot of maps, and I am a sucker for maps.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruins-Gorlan-Rangers-Apprentice-Book/dp/0142406635">The Ruins of Gorlan</a> by John A. Flanagan. Pretty standard YA fantasy, but fun nevertheless. I’d read more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Call-Novel-Yannick-Murphy-ebook/dp/B004MMEIVE">The Call</a> by Yannick Murphy. Eh, what started out as a clever structural gadget became tiring. I am a little curious to know what happens to the family but I gave up.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Novel-Kate-Atkinson-ebook/dp/B008TUQ60G">Life After Life</a> by Kate Atkinson. I like Atkinson, but this book also became tiresome, tho I managed to finish. But I’d recommend a different Atkinson.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farthing-Small-Change-Jo-Walton-ebook/dp/B002LA0ANO">Farthing</a> by Jo Walton. How did I miss this? Conspiracy, murder in the English countryside in an alternative history where Britain made peace with the Nazis. Excellent.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Those-Who-Wish-Me-Dead-ebook/dp/B00FPQA76Q">Those Who Wish Me Dead</a> by Michael Koryta. A boy witnesses a murder, and, well, shit happens. Fun but not memorable.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Uprooted-Naomi-Novik-ebook/dp/B00KUQIU7O">Uprooted</a> by Naomi Novik. A captivating tale of a young witch coming of age and getting drawn into an existential threat for her homeland. Really loved it, deserves the accolades.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Little-Lies-Liane-Moriarty-ebook/dp/B00HDMMISA">Big Little Lies</a> by Liane Moriarty. Completely fun story of conflicts between parents at a preschool, hilarious but serious. Apparently coming to HBO, this will be fun</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Travelers-Novel-Chris-Pavone/dp/0385348487">The Travelers</a> by Chris Pavone. A travel writer is coopted and stumbles into a job as a spy, and slowly learns that nothing is as it seems in his life. Fun.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Song-Machine-Inside-Hit-Factory/dp/0393241920">The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory</a> by John Seabrook. No surprise here, pop music is largely a manufactured product.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whites-Novel-Richard-Price/dp/0312621302">The Whites</a> by Richard Price. Couldn’t finish. Supposedly a gritty police drama but kind of dull.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Electric-Barracuda-Novel-Serge-Storms/dp/0061876917">Electric Barracuda</a> by Tim Dorsey. I generally don’t like farce, but there is something endearing about this character – a wise-cracking serial killer with a heart of gold.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Souls-Nights-Masque-ebook/dp/B005411EL4">The Alchemist of Souls</a> by Anne Lyle.

Entertaining, not sure I am driven to keep up with the series tho.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Birds-Charlie-Jane-Anders-ebook/dp/B00W190RPG">All the Birds in the Sky</a> by Charlie Jane Anders.

Good characters but I felt it kind of dissolved into mystical goo.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chimera-Parasitology-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B00X47ZY9S">Chimera</a> by Mira Grant. The last in a 3 book series about semi-intelligent and autonomous tapeworms invading human beings. OK it was fun at times but probably 1 book too long.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Victoria-Vanishes-Peculiar-Crimes-Mystery-ebook/dp/B0013TPXD6">The Victoria Vanishes</a> by Christopher Fowler. Fun tale of two aging detectives investigating a very very strange set of murders. I’ve read another in series, solid characters.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Games-novel-Roger-Hobbs/dp/0385352646">Vanishing Games</a> by Roger Hobbs. Pirates, Macau, Diamonds, Counterfeiting, high bodycount.

    <p>My last batch of books were very good, and so my bar is raised. I couldn’t get through either of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Witch-Lime-Street-Seduction-Houdini/dp/0307451062">The Witch of Lime Street</a>” by David Jaher. This gets great reviews, but is incredibly choppy, and the characters are unappealing, or to be precise, the author does a poor job of introducing them in appealing fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning-Machine/dp/0465065708">The Master Algorithm</a> by Pedro Domingos. This falls into the classic trap that many books of this type fall into – in its attempt to make a technical topic more interesting to a broader audience, it dumbs down its treatment of the topic, and is simplistic and repetitive. And so pushes away readers who have more background. It is obviously hard to achieve the right balance, I could not stay with this book.</li>

Recommended by almost everyone else in the family, this is a great tale of the UW crew team which went to the Berlin Olympics. Especially interesting probably to Seattle residents, but very well written. I had no idea that crew was such a popular sport at the time.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phishing-Phools-Economics-Manipulation-Deception/dp/0691168318">Phishing for Phools</a> by George Akerlof and Robert Shiller. OK I have great empathy for the material, an expose of how we are manipulated and deceived (and how we buy into this). But the book honestly was a little thin, I would have liked more examples and depth.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slade-House-Novel-David-Mitchell/dp/0812998685">Slade House</a> by David Mitchell. Lord can this man write, I love everything he touches. A great creepy haunted house tale, written in the Mitchell style. Hard to put down.</li>

    <p>Facebook has open sourced <a href="https://github.com/torch/torch7">Torch</a>, Google has open sourced <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow">TensorFlow</a>, and now Microsoft has responded with <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK">CNTK</a> (Catchy name, guys). This is awesoem for startups, three great frameworks on reasonable licensing terms, and I am sure they are going to kill each other in an attempt to “win”, which is going to result in a flow of tools and data available to the world at large, since part of winning is building the biggest community. If you are not one of these companies, and you think you need to build and promulgate your own ML framework, I would think hard about that decision.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0812993543">Between the World and Me</a> by Ta-Nehisi Coates. A challenging but important read. It is difficult to really comprehend the road that less privileged have had to travel, but it is important to try to understand and address.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/01/recent-books-coates-tahir-leckie-antrim/9780316246682_custom-b990a1e1d99f5af6bd343b01493a274a4b8e6a6e-s400-c85/"><img src="images/9780316246682_custom-b990a1e1d99f5af6bd343b01493a274a4b8e6a6e-s400-c85.jpg" alt="9780316246682_custom-b990a1e1d99f5af6bd343b01493a274a4b8e6a6e-s400-c85" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ember-Ashes-Sabaa-Tahir/dp/1595148035">An Ember in the Ashes</a> by Sabaa Tahir. Yet another dystopian YA trilogy, but well written and very enjoyable.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Mercy-Imperial-Radch-Leckie/dp/0316246689">Ancillary Mercy</a> by Ann Leckie. Third in the series and it is still holding up. Fascinating far future tale of empire and intrigue with a very unique set of ideas about identity.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Verificationist-Novel-Donald-Antrim/dp/0312662149">The Verificationist</a> by Donald Antrim. Very well written, the self-absorbed main character is having a breakdown or trip, and you are along for the ride.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moxyland-Lauren-Beukes-ebook/dp/B01922I24M">Moxyland</a> by Lauren Beukes. Eh, near future spread of technology through the less developed world. Some nice ideas but ultimately bored me.</li>

    <p>Truth, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Verificationist-Novel-Donald-Antrim/dp/0312662149">The Verificationist</a>, by Donald Antrim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We eat pancakes to escape loneliness, yet within moments we want nothing more than our freedom from ever having so<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2015/12/we-promise-ourselves-that-we-will-know-better-next-time-than-to-order-pancakes-in-any-size-or-in-any-amount/veri/"><img src="images/veri.jpeg" alt="veri" /></a> much as thought about pancakes. Nothing can prevent us, after eating pancakes, from feeling the most awful regret. After eating pancakes, our great mission in life becomes the repudiation of the pancakes and everything served along with them, the bacon and the syrup and the sausage and coffee and jellies and jams. But these things are beneath mention, compared with the pancakes themselves. It is the pancake—Pancakes! Pancakes!—that we never learn to respect. We promise ourselves that we will know better, next time, than to order pancakes in any size or in any amount. Never again will we be tempted by buckwheat or buttermilk or blueberry flapjacks. However, we fail to learn; and the days go by, two or three weeks pass, then a month, and we forget about pancakes and their dominion over us. Eventually, we need them. We crawl back to pancakes again and again.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zero-World-Jason-M-Hough/dp/0553391267">Zero World</a> by Jason Hough. Started out nice with some speculations about a guilt-free mind-wiped assassin, but turned to crap quickly with a really stupid many worlds interpretation. Don’t bother.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Scorpion-Nancy-Farmer/dp/0689852231">The House of the Scorpion</a> by Nancy Farmer. Yet another YA dystopian novel, tho this at least wasn’t in the games/maze/stupid challenge space. Kind of forgettable tho.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nemesis-Harry-Hole-Novel/dp/0062119699">Nemesis</a> by Jo Nesbo. Solid scandinavian mystery, the main character is an appealing misfit.</li>
