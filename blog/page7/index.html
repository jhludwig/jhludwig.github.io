				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">07 October 2019</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>We get to spend two days with strategy consultants this week. I spent the first four years of my career as a strategy consultant and I have some perspective.</p>

<p>Strategy is not some task you do every once in a while as executives. Strategy formulation, implementation, testing, and revision is a daily, hourly task. The best operators in the company are deeply involved in it. Sales people are pitching your strategy, and getting data back from customers on acceptance, pricing, competitive alternatives, and unmet needs. Product people are implementing, identifying unexpected hurdles, and finding new innovations every day. Everyone is trying out competitive products, seeing competitive moves, every day.</p>

<p>Every day all this info needs to be processed by the org, and the strategy needs to adapt. Strategy formulation and reformulation is thus totally intermingled with operations, and the best orgs are incredibly nimble at incorporating all the daily data and evolving strategy.</p>

<p>Strategies created outside the operating team often fail because they are not realistic – they are not implementable, they don’t account for what is really happening in the technology or with the customers, they are uninformed by the daily competitive pressure the operating team faces. And the operating teams knows all this, and so doesn’t buy into the strategy.</p>

<p>While I was a strategy consultant, I was presenting some brilliantly conceived strategy to one of our senior partners, Tom. Tom had been in the consulting business a long time and had seen a jillion businesses. He listened to my presentation, and then said “this is all nice, but your strategy is what you ship”.</p>

<p>It was an aha moment for me that has stuck with me ever since.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">15 September 2019</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Tesla is just kicking ass in car apps — <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/09/15/tesla-v10-first-look-release-notes-features/">https://electrek.co/2019/09/15/tesla-v10-first-look-release-notes-features/</a>.   They made an investment in a UX and data architecture and it is paying off.  Most carmakers are targeting where Tesla was 18-24 months ago, and by the time their cars ship, they will be even further behind.  </p>

<p>The carmakers have some options, none of which are easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embrace the phone.  Support Android Auto and CarPlay, give up on competing on base car UX and apps, and build auto-specific features and services on top of Android Auto and CarPlay.  This is not a terrible strategy, carmakers can focus their energy on car-specific features.  Xevo works with a number of carmakers on upcoming solutions along these lines, these will be good experiences.</li>
  <li>Try to drag race Tesla.  Some carmakers are trying this, it will be difficult to win this drag race if the carmaker is not tapping into software development talent in one of the software development centers — Bay Area, Seattle, NYC.  Xevo works with a couple of OEMs on this basis, tapping into the great Seattle ecosystem and labor market.  This is a tough strategy though and maybe the highest risk strategy.</li>
  <li>Leapfrog Tesla.  Open up the car UX and car data to a full software ecosystem.  Get 10,000 companies targeting the vehicles.  Carmakers are historically resistant to this, wanting to hold onto all aspects of car UX and car data, but just as the industry transitioned from feature phones to smartphones, the industry will make a transition to a more open car software ecosystem, and benefits will accrue to those who lead the transition.  Xevo also works with OEMs on this basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>These strategies are not mutually exclusive — every carmaker has many nameplates, model years, and regions — they have a lot of at bats, and can try out variants of these strategies, and learn from each trial.  The key thing is to set a reach goal for the software ecosystem in the car, and get moving aggressively on some of these strategies.</p>
</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Golem-Jinni-Novel-P-S/dp/0062110845">The Golem and the Jinni</a> by Helene Wecker. In the late 1800s in NYC, a golem and a jinni struggle to fit into human society and become human themselves. Very entertaining and a nicely introspective about what defines humanity. I’d had this on the Kindle forever, Vlad goaded me into reading.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcadia-Iain-Pears/dp/1101970839">Arcadia</a> by Iain Pears. A fantasy, science fiction, time travel, mystery, adventure, book within a book. A lot going on in here and very engaging.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464345">Homo Deus</a> by Yuval Noah Harari. Some compelling ideas but boy a lot of words. And in the last third of the book he goes off the rails, he has a mechanistic view of science and biology that feels very off. Still a good read but could be better.</li>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">30 July 2019</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Writing software for cars is hard. Processors are generations behind mobile phones. Compute/network platforms are byzantine and fractured within/across OEMs. OS environments/toolchains are clunky/archaic. Internet connectivity is unavailable, intermittent, and costly.</p>

<p>Long OEM production cycles are fundamentally inconsistent with modern agile software cycles. OEMs aren’t excited about having more software. Security requirements are tough, durability/reliability requirements are tougher. There are substantial regulatory issues.</p>

<p>Nothing is easy, every line of code we ship seems to take a herculean effort. So why do we do it? There certainly must be easier hills to climb.</p>

<p>Well, cars are iconic products in our society. We use them every day, we spend an incredible amount of time in them. Our friends and family all use them, and when we do something right in them, everyone we care about will notice.</p>

<p>And there is plenty of room to do better. The user experience for software and services is not good today. With a very few exceptions, people don’t like their in-car experience.</p>

<p>We are in the “feature phone” period of car UX; Xevo and other companies working to open up the car software and data platforms to 1000s of apps, and open up the environment to the kind of continuous iteration that has driven advances in mobile and cloud software.</p>

<p>And the opportunity for innovation and learning is great. We are working on deeply interesting UX problems and distributed processing problems that are unique to the automotive space today, but have very broad applicability.</p>

<p>Figuring out how to do engaging distraction-free apps, how to partition processing across widely-distributed networks of untrusted vehicles, how to monetize data while protecting privacy – these are all interesting and fascinating and are being driven by the automotive environment.</p>

<p>And that is what attracts us – the chance to make big changes in the auto experience, the chance to learn and work on great problems, the chance to work with great like-minded people. If you know of anyone who might be excited about the challenges, please introduce them!</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Plague-David-Walton-ebook/dp/B01MT6ZAS5">The Genius Plague</a> by David Walton. Award Winner, and has some great concepts, but wasn’t an amazing story. Fun but forgettable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empty-Planet-Global-Population-Decline-ebook/dp/B07CWHYVW5">Empty Planet</a> by Darrell Bricker and John Ibbitson.  Very interesting book about declining birth rates and the implications for us.  No real conclusions but thought provoking.  There are some vitriolic reviews on Amazon claiming bias, and as you read the reviews, it is clear the reviewers are heavily biased, which just made me more interested in the book.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magpie-Murders-Novel-Anthony-Horowitz-ebook/dp/B01M1G8JQE">Magpie Murders</a> by Anthony Horowitz.  Good but not great.  I love books that play with structure, but this didn’t really go anywhere with the concept.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Helicopter-Heist-Novel-Based-Events/dp/1590519507">The Helicopter Heist</a> by Jonas Bonnier. Gripping, the last half of the book was a rollercoaster. Looking forward to rumored Netflix treatment.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plotters-Novel-Kim-ebook/dp/B07CWDMQ45">The Plotters</a> by Un-su Kim. Thriller, a little surreal, even a bit of a parable. Interesting tho not something I would want to diet steadily on.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snap-Belinda-Bauer-ebook/dp/B075VDP295">Snap</a> by Belinda Bauer. The cover claims this book is long listed for the Man Booker Prize, and that is normally the kiss of death for me, I find the winners to be unreadable. But this is a great thriller and a lot of fun.</li>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">26 April 2019</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>In a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/amp/2019/04/25/mk-8-vw-golf-software-issues/">recent article about the latest VW Golf,</a> the product manager was quoted “Already now there are ten times more lines of code in the latest Golf than in a smartphone”. This statement is interesting in some many directions.</p>

<p>Software content in a car is growing exponentially as connectivity, autonomy, sensors, new compute platforms, electrification all drive into the car and this VW metric is an interesting indicator.</p>

<p>But is that too much software? It seems like my cellphone is jammed full of software, does my car really need 10X the lines of code?</p>

<p>But then the car has at least two major compute domains (UX and drive control) with many smaller compute loads, and maybe it is reasonable to have a lot more software than a smartphone?</p>

<p>Is KLOCs the right way to measure software? That is an ’80s way of thinking about software content and leads to some very bad behavior. Should anyone be proud of this?</p>

<p>What is the quality level of that software? Modern smartphones and the services that power them have the most highly compensated people in the industry banging away on them. How should we feel about a software system with 10x the number of components but with less highly compensated engineers? What is the total lifetime cost of all that software? What is the security exposure of all the software?</p>

<p>The biggest challenge VW is struggling with is OTA updates per the article. The OTA challenge in a car is broad – firmware, headunits, apps all have their own lifecycles and OTA needs. Is there an understanding that a great architecture for OTA and application isolation in the car are probably the first things that should have been put in place?</p>

<p>How much software should be on your mobile phone and in the cloud to support your driving? More or less than is in the car itself? How does that change when your car is always connected?</p>

<p>It is fascinating time in the auto industry. Software content is growing by leaps and bounds. While the VW number may be too high today, there is going to be a LOT more software content in cars over time.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Towns-000-Mile-Journey-America/dp/1101871849">Our Towns</a> by James and Deborah Fallows. An uplifting walk thru towns and cities across America, each of which is finding its way and wrestling successfully with renewal, growth, education, immigration. There is a lot of great stuff happening everywhere — we shouldn’t let the national miasma blind us. One observation they make — almost every town on an upward track has a micro brewery.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Those-Who-Knew-Idra-Novey/dp/0525560432">Those Who Knew</a> by Idra Novey. Not my usual style but a satisfying tale of a corrupt politician whose life ultimately unravels, and lifting of that weight off the people around him.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Senlin-Ascends-Books-Babel-Book-ebook/dp/B074M62D7Y">Senlin Ascends</a> by Josiah Bancroft. First in a series about a world dominated by a steampunk-ish Tower of Babel. Part allegory, part swashbuckler. A great deal of fun.</li>
