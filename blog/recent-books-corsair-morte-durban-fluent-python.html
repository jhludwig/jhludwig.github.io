<p>Re the last book, I’ve been reflecting on science fiction as a genre. In recent weeks I’ve been feeling bad about the genre as writer after writer dismisses it in the NY Times – <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/books/review/daniel-silva-by-the-book.html">Daniel Silva</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/books/review/terry-mcmillan-by-the-book.html">Terry McMillan</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/books/review/jeffrey-toobin-by-the-book.html">Jeffrey Toobin</a>. One can argue that I shouldn’t care about these opinions, but still. One aspect I think these writers miss is the ability of speculative fiction to explore the societal impacts of technology, as I note in the book above, and I find this to be valuable and interesting.</p>

<p>I was also feeling a little annoyed at these writers for their blanket dismissal of a genre, that didn’t seem very clever to me. I was happy to read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/alan-moore-by-the-book.html">Alan Moore</a> this week, who just nails the key point that genre doesn’t have to be limiting at all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m happiest when I’m outside it altogether, or perhaps more accurately, when I can conjure multiple genres all at once, in accordance with my theory (now available, I believe, as a greeting card and fridge magnet) that human life as we experience it is a simultaneous multiplicity of genres. I put it much more elegantly on the magnet. With that said, of course, there are considerable pleasures to be found in genre, foremost among which is that of either violating or transcending it, assuming there’s a difference, and using it to talk about something else entirely. Some subversions, paradoxically, can even seem to reinvigorate the stale conventions that they’d set out to subvert or satirize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every genre has bad writing, and bad genre writing is bad. I am going to dedicate myself to reading good genre reading, and especially writing that pushes the boundaries of the genre.</p>
