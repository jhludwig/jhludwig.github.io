  If this was the first smartphone I’d ever had, I’d be happy. Good app selection, looks nice, works fine.
  Battery life is a lot better than the iPhone 5 + ios 7. Not sure why but it is better. Life changing better? No, but I don’t have to run from charger to charger anymore. I can get 3/4s of a day of solid use on a charge, and I am always in the car a little bit each day (with car charger), and so I am generally making it a full day. Much happer.
  As many people have pointed out, the touchscreen is just not as good as the iphone. Fewer pixels, worse software, I don’t know, but it is just not as good.
  Fragmentation has real impacts. I’ve tried to change usage tips with other Android users, and simple things are moved around in the UI from OEM to OEM. Or carrier to carrier. Just stupid on everyone’s part.

<p>I’m going to probably root the phone in the next couple weeks and see if I can’t get a clean Android build on and see if that improves the fragmentation point. Good tips up on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2456">xda dev</a></p>
