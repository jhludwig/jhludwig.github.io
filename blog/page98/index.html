    <p>3 machines at work, 7 at home, and I occasionally need a spreadsheet on all of them. Office is too expensive and overkill, OpenOffice is overkill. I need something lightweight. Trying out <a href="http://www.byedesign.freeserve.co.uk/">Spread32</a> at the moment. A couple other choices at <a href="http://www.tinyapps.org/">tinyapps</a> as well including <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/history/vcexecutable.htm">visicalc</a>. Actually I’d love a server-based spreadsheet, a self-hosted open source version of <a href="http://www.securesheet.com/">this</a>, so i wouldn’t have to install anything or worry about moving my spreadsheet files around with me.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/09/05/osu-27-cincinnati-6.html">OSU 27, Cincinnati 6</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Well the Bucks won by an un-Tressel like margin of 21 points. And the offensive numbers in aggregate look good – 462 total yards, 5.1 yards per rush. And some good individual plays by Holmes, Hamby, Childress, Ross and Pittman on offense. But really the offense looked tentative the entire game, and error-prone (4 fumbles, 2 INTs as I recall). Zwick was forcing the ball a lot, Ross with the exception of his one long run didn’t look materially better than last year. The team needs to grow a lot in the next couple weeks or the Big 10 season could be tough.</p>

<p>Defensively the team looked tentative the first quarter, no surprise given the number of players gone from last year. But then the guys put together three strong defensive possesions in a row in the 2nd quarter and seemed to find its legs. And was helped by a truly terrible Cincy punting game – the punter kept hitting line drives that skipped through the end zone, great for distance, but lousy for field position.</p>

<p>The best thing about the game – OSU was clearly in command despite all the tentative play and mistakes. With growth they could be a great team this year.</p>

OK not that original – an ordinary family’s life comes unwound when a secret from the past surfaces; not everyone is who they seem to be; eventually the cops, US Attorney’s office, and organized crime families are all drawn in. But nicely paced and interesting characters. The resolution is a little weak but still a good yarn, I’d pick up more by Coben.</p>

    <p>OK nothing that educational here, just some fun reading.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743437810/qid=1094096485/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/104-9987463-4257565?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Vanished Man</a> by Jeffery Deaver. My first Deaver, I wasn’t that impressed with the main characters in the series, Lincoln Rhyme and buddies. But a well crafted story that kept the action moving along.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765302624/qid=1094096609/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/104-9987463-4257565">Blind Lake</a> by Robert Charles Wilson. Great characters, a good story. The characters had real human depth, they weren’t just set pieces moved around for the purposes of the plot. And the story raised and explored big questions, without feeling the need to provide a metaphysical explanation of the entire universe as is lamely attempted by so many science fiction novels.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/08/24/911-commission-report.html">9/11 Commission Report</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Just finished reading this. Every US citizen should read it – or at least read the recommendation chapters (12 and 13) – available for download at <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm" title="National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States">National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States</a>.</p>

<p>Reading it makes me feel much more activist about the problem. And much more realistic about the time it is going to take to overcome the terrorism problem – the book mentions that we should think in terms of decades.</p>
