				<p><p>An aha moment for me recently. Two unusual books I have read recently have significant online presences. <a href="http://chuckpalahniuk.net/books/rant">Rant</a> has a fairly rich site with a lot of content related to the author and the book. Nothing that really changes the book experience, but some useful supporting materials.</p>

<p>The Raw Shark Texts is a much deeper experience – <a href="http://forums.steven-hall.org/">Steven-Hall.org</a>. I can see now that reading the book has only given me a facet of the story, there is a tremendous amount of additional discussion and material online, some of which may be very material to the story and the experience. The physical book is truly just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>I just happened to stumble on the Raw Shark Texts web info, I was looking for the author’s email to send him a note asking about the quality of the Kindle version.</p>

<p>And now I wonder why the Kindle version can’t be more than just a rerendering of the physical book. Why can’t it be a subscription to the ongoing content stream? I’d pay more.</p>

				<p><p>Had a great father’s day, got some cool photo tools, some books that look great, and a couple of games since I have played Left4Dead and Fallout3 to death. Here’s some stuff I didn’t get and probably for good reason.</p>

<p>Physical Stuff:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://fountaincan.com/index.html">Faux fountains</a> via <a href="http://www.sjl.us/main/2009/06/a-floating-faucet-fountain.html">Scott Loftesness</a>. Cool looking and an inspiration for Halloween. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/06/ip-pbx-for-dummies/">IP PBX tips for home</a>. I was all excited about this several years ago but increasingly not so…having resident phone technology seems so backwards * <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2009/06/new_projects_wa.php">Projects Watches wristwatches</a>. Cool looking but increasingly I have given up on wristwatches. * <a href="http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20090111/the-home-security-television-simulator/">Television emulator.</a> I don’t know, I think the dogs would prefer to watch real TV. * <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/the_evolution_of_camera_forms_part_1_then_and_now_13795.asp">Olympus PEN</a>. Having just hauled the Canon up and down a mountain Sunday morning, the idea of a smaller form factor camera with great lenses is appealing. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/03/denon-avp-aqhd/">Super Duper Denon pre-amp</a>. Just can’t face all the cabling problems tho of disconnecting my current and connecting in a new.</p>

<p>Virtual Stuff: * <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a>. Like the idea of automated analysis of my financials, but I am just not going to give another party access to all my financial credentials. They should license these tools to financial service firms for use on their own websites. * <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348279,00.asp?kc=PCRSS02129TX1K0000530">Cisco Network Magic</a>. Nice review. Congrats to the former Pure Networks team. * <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/10259">Filemaker Bento iPhone app</a>. I regularly get sucked into thinking I need a database and this app is sucking me in again. I know tho I will enter 7 records and abandon the damn thing so I am holding off.</p>

				<p><p>* “Portuguese Irregular Verbs”:amazon by Alexander McCall Smith. A self-absorbed eccentric man leads an eccentric life with eccentric friends. Thankfully short. Amazon says 3.5 stars, this seems high. 2 stars I’d say. * “Real World”:amazon by Natsuo Kirino. Curious to read a well regarded novel from Japan. But didn’t do it for me. Callow angst-ridden teenagers, yawn. Amazon says 4 stars, I say 1.5. Couldn’t finish the book. * “Obedience: A Novel”:amazon by Will Lavender. Kind of interesting premise, a psychological game unfolds on a campus, slowly sucking in some students. But the characters were thin and the pacing forced and all a little unbelievable. First novel so here’s hoping practice makes perfect. Amazon says 2.5 stars, why did I buy this book?? I’d say 1.5 stars – I could finish it but I wish I hadn’t. * “The Raw Shark Texts”:amazon by Steven Hall. Another first novel, this one is a crackerjack of a story. A gripping opening, an interesting central premise about memes, great imagery. Really awesome. Amazon says 4 stars, I agree wholeheartedly, an interesting book. * “Rant: an oral biography of Buster Casey”:amazon by Chuck Palaniuk. Chuck, you need therapy. A disturbing tale of epidemic, time travel, moral laxity, bigotry, disease. Interesting, yes. Corrupting, probably. Amazon says 4 stars, I’d agree, though this is a warped book.</p>

				<p><p>* “The Walls Of The Universe”:amazon by Paul Melko. Starts out very promising, protagonist and his doppelgänger travelling through a many worlds multiverse, trying to recapture the lives they had. But the deeper emotional themes get swamped by a uninspiring run-of-the-mill conspiracy story. Amazon gives it 4.5 stars, I’d say 3. * “The Stone Gods”:amazon by Jeanette Winterson. Outrage at humanity’s casual misuse of the planet and each other, despair, a smidgen of hope, with hints of Bradbury, LeGuin, Moorcock. Not my taste at all. Amazon says 4 stars, I’d say 2, but some people like this style. * “The Right Mistake”:amazon by Walter Mosley. Great collection of stories about a modern day urban Socrates. Uplifting. Amazon says 4 stars with some saying earlier books in the series are better, I haven’t read them, I liked this one just fine. * “Genesis”:amazon by Bernard Beckett. Modern day retelling of the Genesis story with some twists. Entertaining and thoughtful, short and sweet. Amazon says 4 stars, I’d agree. * “The Good Guy”:amazon by Dean Koontz. Solid action tale. Ending a bit too pat and the underlying conspiracy a bit too standard, but nice tale up to that point. I expected supernatural from Koontz and was pleased that this book was not supernatural. Amazon says 4 stars, I’m good with that. * “Halting State”:amazon by Charles Stross. Good cyber adventure. Stross is reliably entertaining. Another 4 star from Amazon, I like this as well as anything in this set, I might say 4.5 stars.</p>

				<p><p>* “Alphabet Juice”:amazon by Roy Blount Jr. Fun wordplay. Probably best read as a bathroom book. If you hate word etymologies, crosswords, etc., don’t bother. Amazon says 4 stars, true if you are a word geek. * “The Drunkard’s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives”:amazon by Leonard Mlodinow. A little plodding at times but a reasonable discussion about the prevalence of chance in our lives and our continual efforts to force cause-and-effect structures on the brownian motion all around us. The key life lesson is this – persevere and swing the bat as often as you can. And be humble about your successes and forgiving of others lack of success, because luck plays a bigger role than talent. Amazon says 4 stars, I’m ok with that * “Outliers: The Story of Success”:amazon by Malcolm Gladwell. A solid magazine article blown up into a book. Success == hard work, built on top of the opportunities provided us by our unique family/culture. Fun anecdotes. Amazon says 4 stars, it is a well-written book, but a little thin.</p>

<p>Actually, reading The Drunkard’s Walk, Outliers, and The Black Swan as a set would not be a terrible idea for most people to learn about randomness, how it will affect your life, and strategies for coping.</p>

<p>* “War As They Knew It: Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler, and America in a Time of Unrest”:amazon by Michael Rosenberg. Good story of the Hayes/Schembechler rivalry years and the times and changes on their campuses during these years. Enjoyed more than I thought I would. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I think this is right if you are a Michigan or OSU fan or big college football fan.</p>

<p>* It is not clear to me that it enhances recreational reading at all – and in fact the size makes it less convenient</p>

<p>* The cost savings on textbooks aren’t large enough for me to get excited yet</p>

<p>* And more importantly the usage model of a textbook is different than that of a recreational book. Lots of flipping to sections, flipping back and forth, index usage, marking places, etc – does the device make this better?</p>

<p>* Can I use it in an open book exam setting?</p>

<p>So I am not sure yet. Eventually the weight savings may compel me but I am not there yet.</p>
