				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">30 July 2019</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Writing software for cars is hard. Processors are generations behind mobile phones. Compute/network platforms are byzantine and fractured within/across OEMs. OS environments/toolchains are clunky/archaic. Internet connectivity is unavailable, intermittent, and costly.</p>

<p>Long OEM production cycles are fundamentally inconsistent with modern agile software cycles. OEMs aren’t excited about having more software. Security requirements are tough, durability/reliability requirements are tougher. There are substantial regulatory issues.</p>

<p>Nothing is easy, every line of code we ship seems to take a herculean effort. So why do we do it? There certainly must be easier hills to climb.</p>

<p>Well, cars are iconic products in our society. We use them every day, we spend an incredible amount of time in them. Our friends and family all use them, and when we do something right in them, everyone we care about will notice.</p>

<p>And there is plenty of room to do better. The user experience for software and services is not good today. With a very few exceptions, people don’t like their in-car experience.</p>

<p>We are in the “feature phone” period of car UX; Xevo and other companies working to open up the car software and data platforms to 1000s of apps, and open up the environment to the kind of continuous iteration that has driven advances in mobile and cloud software.</p>

<p>And the opportunity for innovation and learning is great. We are working on deeply interesting UX problems and distributed processing problems that are unique to the automotive space today, but have very broad applicability.</p>

<p>Figuring out how to do engaging distraction-free apps, how to partition processing across widely-distributed networks of untrusted vehicles, how to monetize data while protecting privacy – these are all interesting and fascinating and are being driven by the automotive environment.</p>

<p>And that is what attracts us – the chance to make big changes in the auto experience, the chance to learn and work on great problems, the chance to work with great like-minded people. If you know of anyone who might be excited about the challenges, please introduce them!</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>In a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/amp/2019/04/25/mk-8-vw-golf-software-issues/">recent article about the latest VW Golf,</a> the product manager was quoted “Already now there are ten times more lines of code in the latest Golf than in a smartphone”. This statement is interesting in some many directions.</p>

<p>Software content in a car is growing exponentially as connectivity, autonomy, sensors, new compute platforms, electrification all drive into the car and this VW metric is an interesting indicator.</p>

<p>But is that too much software? It seems like my cellphone is jammed full of software, does my car really need 10X the lines of code?</p>

<p>But then the car has at least two major compute domains (UX and drive control) with many smaller compute loads, and maybe it is reasonable to have a lot more software than a smartphone?</p>

<p>Is KLOCs the right way to measure software? That is an ’80s way of thinking about software content and leads to some very bad behavior. Should anyone be proud of this?</p>

<p>What is the quality level of that software? Modern smartphones and the services that power them have the most highly compensated people in the industry banging away on them. How should we feel about a software system with 10x the number of components but with less highly compensated engineers? What is the total lifetime cost of all that software? What is the security exposure of all the software?</p>

<p>The biggest challenge VW is struggling with is OTA updates per the article. The OTA challenge in a car is broad – firmware, headunits, apps all have their own lifecycles and OTA needs. Is there an understanding that a great architecture for OTA and application isolation in the car are probably the first things that should have been put in place?</p>

<p>How much software should be on your mobile phone and in the cloud to support your driving? More or less than is in the car itself? How does that change when your car is always connected?</p>

<p>It is fascinating time in the auto industry. Software content is growing by leaps and bounds. While the VW number may be too high today, there is going to be a LOT more software content in cars over time.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Towns-000-Mile-Journey-America/dp/1101871849">Our Towns</a> by James and Deborah Fallows. An uplifting walk thru towns and cities across America, each of which is finding its way and wrestling successfully with renewal, growth, education, immigration. There is a lot of great stuff happening everywhere — we shouldn’t let the national miasma blind us. One observation they make — almost every town on an upward track has a micro brewery.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Library-Book-Susan-Orlean/dp/1476740186/">The Library Book</a> by Susan Orlean. A peek inside the history, operations, and stories behind the LA Public Library, written by someone who loves books and libraries. Really enjoyable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Civility-Novel-Amor-Towles-ebook/dp/B004IYJDVG">Rules of Civility</a> by Amor Towles. Surprisingly fantastic tale of a young woman in Manhattan finding her way in the world pre WWII. Started slow but oh my gosh did it pick up. Inspiring in many ways.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doubtful-Guest-Edward-Gorey/dp/0151003130">The Doubtful Guest</a> by Edward Gorey. Just because I needed some weird.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trains-Buses-People-Opinionated-Transit/dp/1610919025">Trains, Buses, People: An Opinionated Atlas of US Transit</a> by Christof Spieler. Oh I love maps, and this book is chock full of them, and a great overview of transit in the US. It is easy to focus just on your community and not see the big picture, this really helps to provide context. If you just read Seattle papers, you’d think Seattle is screwing up transit constantly, but this book suggests Seattle is doing a decent job at building out an effective system.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paying-Party-College-Maintains-Inequality/dp/0674088026">Paying for the Party: How College Maintains Inequality</a> by Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton. This book intrigues and aggravates me. Which means it is worth reading and thinking about. A pretty damning takedown of the mainstream college education experience. It doesn’t line up with my own experience – but I saw signs of this dark side, and maybe I just lived in ignorance due to my focus and my advantages heading into college.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/1491-Second-Revelations-Americas-Columbus-ebook/dp/B000JMKVE4/">1491</a> by Charles Mann. Great exploration of the civilizations in America before the arrival of the Europeans. I don’t think I realized just how dramatic the die off due to European diseases was, nor how as a result, the world lost cultures and civilizations that rivaled those of Asia. Sobering, sad.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Fracture-Daniel-T-Rodgers-ebook/dp/B004Z17I8M">Age of Fracture</a> by Daniel Rodgers. I really really wanted to like this book, it is well-regarded and seems to have an interesting thesis about what has happened in the last 50 years in our country. But overly wordy and repetitive, I just couldn’t stay with.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Responses-Organizations/dp/0674276604">Exit, Voice and Loyalty</a> by Albert Hirschman. What a difference from the work above. Tight, focused arguments with detailed supporting notes, with clear economic thinking. Really enjoyed this, a lot of insight into company behavior and political party behavior. Very nice.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Medusa-Uploaded-Novel-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B0756K6X32">Medusa Uploaded</a> by Emily Devenport. Starts out super strong, a laborer on a generation ship stumbles into layers and waves of conspiracy. But flags in the last third.</li>

				<p><p><img src="images/the-electric-state-9781501181412_hr-300x270.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bannerless-Saga-Carrie-Vaughn/dp/0544947304">Bannerless</a> by Carrie Vaughn. Excellent detective tale set in a future America devastated by ecological change. The protagonist is an investigator who travels town to town, and finds herself caught up in a mystery that drags up issues from her own past.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Order-Day-Eric-Vuillard/dp/1590519698">The Order of the Day</a> by Eric Vuillard. Short history of the events leading up to the German invasion of Austria. Literary, lyrical, almost whimsical in its writing, tho undercut by the great tragedy that was unfolding. And of course the book offers pointed lessons for our own time. Easy to see why this book has won so many honors.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Here-There-Everywhere-Recording-Beatles-ebook/dp/B000OVLIQU">Here, There, and Everywhere</a> by Geoff Emerick. A personal and much more human look at the Beatles career by one of the few people who were in the room with them a lot. The book is not without bias, but still super interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/IQ-Novel-Joe-Ide/dp/0316267724">IQ</a> by Joe Ide. Fantastic first novel featuring Isaiah Quintabe, a high school dropout working cases in LA for friends and associates. Great character, great setting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electric-State-Simon-Stålenhag-ebook/dp/B07CMMH9N1">The Electric State</a> by Simon Stålenhag. Exceptional story/art/graphic novel about a strange future/alternative America, where we have let technology run amok. The art is so integral to the story, I can’t imagine the Kindle version is worth buying.</li>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">01 January 2019</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I just reviewed all my books I read over the last year. Here are the ones that stick with me.</p>

<p>Fiction:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Systems-Red-Murderbot-Diaries/dp/0765397536">All Systems Red</a> by Martha Wells. The first in a super fun science fiction series</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Still-Life-Louise-Penny/dp/0312541538">Still life</a> by Louise Penny. The first in her series featuring Inspector Gamache, every entry I’ve read in the series is great.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Committee-Members-Julie-Schumacher/dp/0345807332">Dear Committee Members</a> by Julie Schumacher. Hilarious series of letters from a disgruntled professor</li>
</ul>

<p>On the nonfiction side:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-Lakes/dp/0393355551">The Death and Life of the Great Lakes</a> by Dan Egan. Won’t be everyone’s cup of tea but if you’ve spent time on the lakes, worth a read</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darkening-Age-Christian-Destruction-Classical/dp/0544800885">The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World</a> by Catherine Nixey. Probably will upset some readers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</a> by John Carreyrou. Wow, so much bad behavior by so many people.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Trump-Touches-Dies-Republican/dp/1982103124">Everything Trump Touches Dies: A Republican Strategist Gets Real About the Worst President Ever</a> by Rick Wilson. Lots of competition for books shining a light on our current “President”, this was my favorite.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Command-Control-Damascus-Accident-Illusion/dp/0143125788">Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety</a> by Eric Schlosser. Wow we have had so many near misses. And this is nuclear weapons – how much slop and error is there in other governmental and corporate processes (say, drug testing) where the stakes are much lower?</li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome any comments or reading ideas from others!</p>
