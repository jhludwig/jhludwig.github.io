<p>I have a more sizeable contribution chunked up and ready to go soon, so hopefully this won’t be the last.</p>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/OpenGL-Programming-Guide-Official-Learning/dp/0321773039">OpenGL Programming Guide</a> by Shreiner, Sellers, Kessenich, Licea-Kane. Incredibly boring in a good way. Very useful depth walkthru of OpenGL.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forty-Signs-Rain-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0553585800/">Forty Signs of Rain</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson. Boring in a bad way, unreadable. The author attempts to wrap his nonfiction treatise with some thin and dull characters who lead boring lives. Gave up on.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Riddle-Master-Patricia-McKillip/dp/0441005969">Riddle-Master</a> by Patricia A McKillip. Fun semi-classic fantasy romp. Nicely wraps up in a modest number of pages unlike the modern commercial 10+ tome series.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Film-Language-Daniel-Arijon/dp/187950507X">Grammar of the Film Language</a> by Daniel Arijon. Great reference on a topic I was clueless about, hat tip to Paul. A little dated but super useful.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Head-Beatles-Records-Sixties-ebook/dp/B0050DRVUO/">Revolution in the Head</a> by Ian MacDonald. Another excellent history of the Beatles, focusing on their songs and what was going on in the culture and the group at the time. MacDonald takes a very critical look at the songs at times, which makes the discussion all that much more compelling.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lexicon-Max-Barry-ebook/dp/B00AEBETMK/">Lexicon</a> by Max Barry. Fun adventure with very erudite zombies.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Winter-Laura-Kasischke-ebook/dp/B00DB3D424/">Mind of Winter</a> by Laura Kasischke. Uber-creepy story of a woman in the grips of a possible breakdown, or is something else going on?</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-You-Harlan-Coben-ebook/dp/B00DMCPQUW">Missing You</a> by Harlan Coben. Another solid Coben, started out a little slow, but grabbed by the end.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Annihilation-Novel-Southern-Reach-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00EGJ32A6/">Annihilation</a> by Jeff VanderMeer. At first I thought this was going to be yet another post-apocalyptic dystopian series written to sell books, but this is something quite different. An expedition enters a blighted area in the south, and nothing is what it seems – the nature of the blight, the goals of the expedition, the members of the expedition all have hidden natures. I’ve pre-ordered the next book.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Duke-Deception-Vintage-Geoffrey-Wolff-ebook/dp/B004G60B58/">Duke of Deception</a> by Geoffrey Wolff. A man unravels the life of his father – a conman, liar, thief, but still a loving father. Complex relationship.</li>

    <p>Just a reminder to self – some of the kits out there come with &lt;1 amp supplies, and most come with 1 amp. The 1 amp supply is barely adequate for the base rpi plus camera. Less than 1 amp and camera use will drop your internet connection.</p>

<p>Now if you add in a USB wifi dongle, 1 amp no longer is sufficient. I am having to use a powered hub.</p>

<p>I’d suggest a 2 amp minimum supply.</p>

    <p>I am hosting the webview controller in an OSX app. I have followed the code sample in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/CallJS/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10004241">calljs</a> and i can successfully call javascript functions inside script tags from objective-c. This integration requires that the objective-c program know the name of the javascript function. for instance i have a javascript function called “objective_c_entry()”, and in my objective c wrapper, i can call that entry point using:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>NSString *callResult = [[webView windowScriptObject] callWebScriptMethod:@"objective_c_entry" withArguments:args];
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now I want to move all my javascript into require.js modules; i am not clear how to reference a function in a require.js module from within objective-c. if i am moving my “objective_c_entry” function into a require.js module named “integration”, what string do I pass to callWebScriptMethod?</p>

    <p>So I have a little app that hosts the Webview control and doesn’t do a whole lot more. I am running it on a MacBook Pro Retina display. I’ve enabled fullscreen display, I’ve set the window in the xib to be full retina 2880x1800.</p>

<p>But the webview seems to think it is running at 1440x790ish or so. Basically half res. As reported by NSScreen. And it is pretty clearly running at half resolution.</p>

<p>The same web page looks fine in Chrome, full retina resolution.</p>

<p>Ah interestingly, in Safari, it is also running at half resolution. Hmmm.</p>

<p>Nothing obvious on StackOverflow. Nothing obvious in Apple developer doc (tho I certainly probably missed something).</p>

<p>UPDATE: Mr. Sobeski gave me some ideas. The retina devicePixelRatio is probably involved. Apparently this creates some problems in some configs. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4405710/uiwebview-w-html5-canvas-retina-display might be a direction to try.</p>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Parasite-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B00AFGKSDS/">Parasite</a> by Mira Grant. The start of a new series by the author of the Feed series, which I found to be among the best of the zombie novels I read. This is also a lot of fun, a twist on zombies, in some way much creepier. Looking forward to rest of series.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ice-Harvest-Novel-Scott-Phillips-ebook/dp/B000FCKFDU/">The Ice Harvest</a> by Scott Phillips. A Fargo-esque spiral of crime and misdeeds. Fun.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Jim-Crace-ebook/dp/B00957T6G8">Harvest</a> by Jim Crace. Crace does not write happy tales. This story details the collapse of an insular farming village in the face of political and economic change, and how one man in the village experiences the changes. Kind of grabbed me tho it is a mostly depressing little tale.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Are-All-Completely-Beside-Ourselves-ebook/dp/B00B4FU6KE">We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves</a> by Karen Joy Fowler.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/download.jpeg"><img src="images/download.jpeg" alt="download" /></a> Gripping. A woman tells the story of the unusual family tragedy that occurred at age 5, and how that has rippled through her life and her family’s life. Very hard to put down, and the messages will sit with me a long time.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peanut-Vintage-Contemporaries-Adam-Ross-ebook/dp/B0036S4A1S/">Mr. Peanut</a> by Adam Ross. Three intertwined marriages beset by problems and power struggles, with some Hitchcockian murder built in, or maybe not, and with a mix of fiction and maybe truth. A lot going on here. And a lot of pain. Not sure how I feel about.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Possession-Romance-Vintage-Anniv-Editions-ebook/dp/B007OLYPW2">Possession</a> by A.S. Byatt. Snore. I need to remember that Man-Booker Prize != interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rector-Justin-Novel-Louis-Auchincloss-ebook/dp/B009UQ7MHE/">The Rector of Justin</a> by Louis Auchincloss. A charismatic school founder and his impact on all the lives of the people around him, both good and bad. The power and charisma of a founder/leader can lift some people up and drown others. Really excellent tale and relevant in many walks of life.</li>

And so I am starting to think my profile should look better (thought I haven’t done a thing about), and I considered paying for a higher grade of LinkedIn service so that I could see who was pinging me. But, wow, $240 a year for LinkedIn business service?? That explains their lofty valuation I guess. That is a very rich price to expect of every business professional, the marginal cost to provide the service is effectively $0. I’d worry that this price will drive substitution, it is certainly making me think about that. I need to get a lot more for my $240 than they are offering.</p>

<p>Who else gets $240 a year from business professionals for a software/communications service? When a corporation rolls this up for all their sales and marketing people, how are they going to feel about it? I am sure there is a corporate discount plan tho.</p>

    <p>Over the holidays I had to create an <a href="https://www.uvvu.com/">Ultraviolet account</a>. I was trying to watch a movie on our new XBOX One and I could only find it on the <a href="http://www.vudu.com">Vudu</a> provider, and so first I had to create a Vudu account, and then that chained into having to create an Ultraviolet account. No idea why all this fuss was required, and I didn’t really know what Ultraviolet was for, but we got to watch our movie.</p>

<p>Now one month in, I get a piece of marketing spam from Ultraviolet, and now it is all clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine … the freedom to access your movies and TV shows through many retailers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. Mind blown. What a world that would be. I am so thrilled and excited. It sounds so much better than the 20 other legal or not-so-legal ways to watch videos. And I am so glad that retailers are fully involved, that sounds like it is going to be so much better for me.</p>

<p>So many things wrong here. As a start, give the idle Nook dude a square reader and let him do check outs on the Nook. Giving him something to do, a chance for me to handle a Nook, and completing my transaction more speedily.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Burning-Paradise-Robert-Charles-Wilson-ebook/dp/B00DA6XFS0">Burning Paradise</a> by Robert Charles Wilson. YA pre-apocalyptic alternative history. Fun premise: a somewhat-intelligent organism has pervasively and surreptitiously infected the earth’s biosphere for hidden purposes, but some humans have started to trip to the fact. So fun but characters weak.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Submergence-J-M-Ledgard-ebook/dp/B00BHOSVB8/">Submergence</a> by J. M. Ledgard. Moody tale about a spy and scientist submerged in their respective worlds, submerged in very different ways, trying to come out of their worlds and build a relationship. Not sure how I feel about, I think I’d have to be in just the right mood to like this book.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Go-Back-Reacher-Novel-ebook/dp/B00B0LP48G/">Never Go Back</a> by Lee Child. Another great Reacher book, stronger than some, we see inside Reacher a little more as he grapples with the possibility that he is a father. We need more of this in the Reacher series.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Town-Parties-Funeral-Plus--inAmericas-ebook/dp/B008JHXO6S/">This Town</a> by Mark Leibovich. Inside look at Washington DC. The author knows it is a cesspool, and writes appropriately cynically, but it comes across even worse than he thinks. and he is pretty open about what a self-dealing cesspool it is. So, read this if you feel like stocking up on cynicism.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/S-J-Abrams/dp/0316201642/">S.</a> by J. J. Abrams and Doug Dorst. Well. This book is flawed, the story wavers, it is a pain in the ass to read, there is no way to buy a convenient electronic form because of the physical complexity of the book. And those are all the reasons why I like it as well – ambiguity, confusion, excellent use of physical media, etc. If you wonder how physical books can survive the onslaught of e-books, this is a great book to read and think about.</li>

    <p>David Sobeski has a great writeup on facebook covering Microsoft’s methodical destruction of developer trust over the last 15 years:</p>

<script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/dsobeski/posts/10153683440480008">Post</a> by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dsobeski">David Sobeski</a>.</p>

<p>I am relearning how to be a software developer after many years away and it is notable that, not only am I not using any Microsoft technologies or tools, nothing from Microsoft even entered the consideration set as I selected targets, libs, tools, etc.</p>

<p>Rehashing all the missteps is entertaining, David does a great job of that, I never tracked all this stuff and many of the acronyms and decisions around them are lost in the fog of history. For whatever reason, Microsoft is at the nadir of its developer influence.</p>

<p>If I was the new CEO at Microsoft, fixing this would be job 1, and I wouldn’t be timid. I would have a 6 month plan to make Microsoft relevant to every developer. And there is no way to do that without buying a bunch of assets to get out in front of the existing parades. I’d buy Github or Atlassian. Stackoverflow. I’d buy or embrace a Linux dist – CentOS maybe, or screw it, just buy RedHat. I’d jump into the vagrant/docker world and buy a position in that space. I’d buy modern leading noSQL and Hadoop distributions. Xamarin as a tool. And 10 more things. At the end of this, Microsoft would be in the conversation with every developer on the planet. OK it would be a chocolate mess of technology assets, but read David’s write up – Microsoft has a chocolate mess of assets now, without any developer relevance.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t worry at all in the first 3 years about cleaning all this up and rationalizing it. I’d run the teams separately, I’d encourage them all to go go go, and I’d create organic opportunities for them to talk and discuss collaboration, without forcing it. Relevance as measured by developer use, and speed of evolution would be my top criteria. Every developer who is not using a Microsoft tool or runtime would be viewed as a failure. Internally I’d direct the Visual Studio team to become the tool for every developer, regardless of what platform they are targeting – iOS, Android, AWS, whatever. Rationalization could come later if at all.</p>

<p>This strategy will create confusion, overlaps, duplications, conflicts, and chaos – but dammit, Microsoft will be relevant again. Relevance will make up for a lot of sins.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/12/31/best-board-games-of-the-holiday-season.html">Best board games of the holiday season</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>We always go on a bit of a board game binge over the holidays. We played some holdovers from past years – <a href="http://www.catan.com/">Settlers of Catan</a>, <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders">Seven Wonders</a>. I got an awesome bamboo <a href="http://mycatanboards.com/">catanboard</a> for Catan, that was a great gift. And we got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-SEVEN03ASM-7-Wonders-Cities/dp/B007IW0HME/">Cities</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-SEVUS02ASM-7-Wonders-Leaders/dp/B0055CAF6M/ref=pd_bxgy_t_text_y">Leaders</a> expansions which added additional layers to this game. 7 wonders is a typical resource accumulate, barter, and build game, with a ton of strategic options.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/triassic.jpg"><img src="images/triassic-300x215.jpg" alt="triassic" /></a>And then we tried a bunch of new games, the ones that passed the bar:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.triassicterror.com/">Triassic Terror</a>. The great thing about this game is that we all finished within a couple points of each other, and the outcome was in doubt throughout the game. I have a lot of admiration for a game design that keeps everyone engaged and excited, the designer clearly thought hard about scoring mechanisms. Makes me think a lot about how to design games – if I were designing a game, I’d ignore the genre and backstory and visuals to start, and just get the mechanics and scoring system down, with a goal towards keeping everyone in the game. Only after I had nailed that would I start to overlay the story and visuals. I’ve bought a lot of games that had a great look or great theme, but fell apart completely as a game.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.iellogames.com/The_Phantom_Society.html">The Phantom Society</a>. A very different game of ghosts and ghost hunters. Super simple game setup and game play so you can bring in people who don’t love the complexity of games like Seven Wonders, but you can seriously overbrain this game.</li>
  <li><a href="http://riograndegames.com/Game/1271-Renaissance-Man">Renaissance Man</a>. This game was good but not great. A lot of richness at the beginning of the game, but towards the end the paths all kind of peter out and the game gets a little constrained. But we played it several times and didn’t give up on.</li>
</ul>

<p>We had some failures too but I won’t dwell on those…hope your holidays were good!</p>

    <p>From Twitter, apparently Bud Light is the 2nd most popular search on Google for a beer brand:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">Most searched beer brands on Google in the US in 2013: 1. Blue Moon, 2. Bud Light, 3. Bud Light Platinum, 4.

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I’m scratching my head, what exactly do people need to find out about Bud Light? I have nothing against Bud Light. It is ubiquitously available and ubiquitously advertised. Certainly people aren’t having problems finding the product at Retail. Certainly there is no mystery about what it is. I just can’t figure out what people are thinking when they decide to turn to Google to learn more about Bud Light.</p>

    <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Testament-Mary-Colm-Toibin-ebook/dp/B007EDOTPS">The Testament of Mary</a> by Colm Toibin. Very moving tale of the last days of Jesus, written from the viewpoint of his mother. Great capturing of the anguish of a mother losing a son in terrible fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vanished-Kingdoms-Rise-States-Nations-ebook/dp/B0052RDIAA">Vanished Kingdoms</a> by Norman Davies. Thorough discussion of 17 kingdoms/empires/states that have disappeared from the world. Not Rome or Sparta, but lesser known examples, that probably all thought they would last forever. Humbling but a bit of a slog.</li>

I can feel my macbook heat up and i can watch the battery drain! Pretty stunning what you can do with webgl.</p>

<p>I am trying to figure out the best practice for integrating webgl with a webpage, in particular text. Overlay of CSS/HTML on a webgl element? Stuffing the text right into the webgl? Does the next version of webgl change anything? What lib to use on top of wegbl to make this easier?</p>

<p>Historical aside – what a huge missed opportunity for Microsoft, read for instance <a href="http://www.alexstjohn.com/WP/2013/07/25/the-advent-of-web-3d/">Alex St John’s story of the early days of really expressive content on the web</a>. Microsoft had a browser code-named Chrome in the 90s that had the idea of webgl built into it. Sadly internal machinations killed it – political infighting about ownership of graphics leadership within the company, and a lack of vision in senior management – not enough people were excited about the idea of a browser and web content that brought a PC to its knees, failing to understand that thanks to Moore’s Law, this problem would go away within a short time.</p>
