			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I am so saddened and angered about the Parkland shooting. I work with a colleague who lost his child. I have been useless in the last week processing this.</p>

<p>I’ve sat by year after year as these shootings have happened and done nothing. I need to do my part, I need to speak up, I need to take whatever action I can.</p>

<p>I will demand to my representatives that we try to address these shootings. And I am open to trials on many fronts. Reasonable restrictions on assault rifles, let’s try it. More mental health support, let’s try it. Hardening schools, let’s try it. I have my own beliefs about which of these will be most effective (restrictions on assault rifles), but I support any steps that address the shootings, and preferably a basket of steps. Let’s try them all, measure how they do, and try again. The exact steps are not important — it is the repeated trying that matters.</p>

<p>I will demand to my local and state representatives that we try things locally. Don’t try to “boil the ocean” at the Federal level. Start at the state and local level. That is how the country made progress on LGBT rights.</p>

<p>I will support candidates who refuse to take gun lobby money. I want candidates who work on behalf of citizens, not the gun lobby.</p>

<p>We each need to decide how we are going to react to these shootings. I will speak my feelings, and I will demand that we try policies to address the problem, and that we repeatedly try.</p>

This book has had a lot of buzz, but it is very tiresome.  Some interesting observations but wrapped up in wooden repetitive prose.  The language and story aren’t good enough to make this book widely popular, and the data is too thin for a really technical book.  I resorted to just reading the topic sentences of paragraphs and trying to make do with that.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exit-West-Novel-Mohsin-Hamid-ebook/dp/B01H17U9OQ">Exit West</a> by Mohsin Hamid.  Nice tale of immigration, especially pertinent today. Our birthplace is a matter of sheer chance, it does not define us.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-Adam-Eve-ebook/dp/B06XH7FFWC">The Rise and Fall of Adam and Eve</a> by Stephen Greenblatt.  A dive into the Adam and Eve story, and how its relevance and meaning have changed over the past several thousand years.  Very helpful context, it would be interesting to read the origin myths of other major religions and a theological discussion of them.</li>

But the pace is good, the iPad app really helped run the game, and once we realized that going “insane” in the game opened up play quite a bit, we had a lot of fun.  Definitely recommended.  Not a short game tho.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/King-Tokyo-New-Board-Game/dp/B01F46RPS4">King of Tokyo</a> – super fast to play, easy gameplay, and the game can shift dramatically in seconds.  Also recommended, and you can fly through a game.</p>

<p>A disappointment was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bezier-Games-ONUWBEZ-Ultimate-Werewolf/dp/B00HS7GG5G">One Night Werewolf</a>.  Maybe we needed more eggnog.  With 5 people, it seemed like the outcomes were obvious.  Maybe we were doing it wrong.</p>

				<p><p>We don’t hunt but we like to observe the critters around us.  Trying out the <a href="http://bushnell.com/wildlife/trail-cameras/trophy-cam/trophy-cam-hd-aggressor-wireless">Bushnell Aggressor</a> – no idea if it is the best, but got decent reviews, and we wanted the cellular capability.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2017/12/trying-out-a-game-camera-didnt-realize-how-varied-this-segment-was/ff4dbe6b-dcc1-4623-baf5-13a948f0ddd8/"><img src="images/ff4dbe6b-dcc1-4623-baf5-13a948f0ddd8-300x225.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Bushnell offers its own portal at <a href="http://www.wirelesstrophycam.com">wirelesstrophycam.com</a> and also includes a trial offer for <a href="http://deerlab.com/bushnell">Deerlab</a> which seems to have a bunch more features.  The device also comes with a 30 day wireless trial plan and notifies via text or email of new captures, and apparently you can extend the data plan without a contract which is nice..  It can be configured to capture video or pictures as desired.  It uses an impressive 12 AA batteries but apparently can also be hooked up to a solar panel.</p>

<p>The first critter it spotted is not surprising or particularly alarming!  I will deploy it in a location more likely to see deer, otter, mink, etc in the future.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Not-Sound-Thriller-Heather-Gudenkauf-ebook/dp/B01M8M9IW1">Not A Sound</a> by Heather Gudenkauf.  Solid thriller – a deaf woman stumbles into a mystery, and increasingly learns that those closest to her may be involved.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Function-Language-Novel-ebook/dp/B01NARGQEU">The Seventh Function of Language</a> by Laurent Binet.  Great book, man did this make me feel uneducated – the art, literature, and culture references flew by me, but well written.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical-ebook/dp/B00G3L6JQ4">How Not To Be Wrong</a> by Jordan Ellenberg.  Great discussion of practical math and statistics and how they impact our everyday life.  Really good.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Their-Own-Land-Mourning-ebook/dp/B01EEQ9BSW">Strangers In Their Own Land</a> by Arlie Russell Hochschild.  Another “how does the conservative right think” book.  Useful to try to build empathy.  Let’s hope that the conservative right are reading the equivalent books.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Viking-Economics-How-Scandinavians-Right-ebook/dp/B017QLQ8A6">Viking Economics</a> by George Lakey.  A bit gushing, but still a solid read about Nordic economies and values, and what we can learn from them.  A core point that resonated with me – the Nordic countries have embraced “investing in our people” as a core principle, and a lot of policy decisions stem from that.  This does not seem like a bad idea.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forest-Dark-Novel-Nicole-Krauss-ebook/dp/B01N6IHCSA">Forest Dark</a> by Nicole Krauss.  If I knew more about Judaism and about Kafka, I would probably love this.  It was engaging but I was just missing too much due to my ignorance.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27419654-the-last-girl">The Last Girl</a> by Joe Hart.  Yet another post-apocalyptic tale where women have it bad.  This doesn’t really contribute much to the genre</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29090844-the-stars-are-legion">The Stars are Legion</a> by Kameron Hurley.  Some far distant future where technology and biology and humanity are completely intertwined.  Just OK.</li>
