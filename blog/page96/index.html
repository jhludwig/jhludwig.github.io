<p>“Lydell Ross couldn’t find a hole on a miniature golf course”</p>

<p>“last year, whenever when ran out of the “I” or offset “I” with a FB as a lead blocker we averaged 5.5 yards per carry…This ridiculous formation with TE, wingback, TE accomplishes nothing…You don’t run a counter as the first play of the game. The point of a counter is that it COUNTERS something”</p>

    <p>Tried to install the <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">Airport Express</a> last night, I’ve seen lots of bloggers talking about – <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/airport_express.html" title="Ross Mayfield's Weblog: Airport Express">Ross Mayfield’s Weblog: Airport Express</a>.</p>

<p>I basically think it doesn’t work with WinXP. The install wizard died on two different laptops, in both cases complaining that I needed to let Windows manage my wireless hardware, that 3rd party tools were interfering with my hardware. Well in both cases the machines were configed to allow Windows to manage the hardware so I don’t know what the “wizard”’s problem was. One machine was a dell laptop, one was a jvc japan import. I was finally able to connect to the airport express just using the regular windows connection software, and at that point the airport express admin utility would run. But I could never get the wizard to run, and could never reliably muck with the airport config. I gave up. Another hunk of inert silicon and plastic in the corner of my office.</p>

<p>”[American] public school teachers are almost twice as likely as other parents to choose private schools for their own children, the study by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute found. More than 1 in 5 public school teachers said their children attend private schools. In Washington (28 percent), Baltimore (35 percent) and 16 other major cities, the figure is more than 1 in 4. In some cities, nearly half of the children of public school teachers have abandoned public schools.”</p>

His patronage of Wagner, of architecture, his erratic behaviour, the plot against him, his mysterious death – a lot of interesting threads. I’m more motivated to visit Bavaria now…</p>

<p><em>2. Considering the seemingly unprecedented rash of missed extra points and other seismic choke-jobs by kickers, there may not be a more valuable player in the country than Ohio State’s Mike Nugent. A week after hitting the game-winning, 55-yard field goal to beat Marshall, Nugent went 5-for-5 (from 50, 47, 46, 33 and 30 yards) on a soaking-wet field in the Buckeyes’ 22-14 win over N.C. State. Nugent has been doing this for three years now, earning All-America honors in 2002 when he hit 25 of 28 attempts and following it up with a 16-of-19 junior season and 8 of 9 so far this year (the only miss coming from 50 yards). Is it any coincidence that during the same time span Ohio State, despite often struggling terribly on offense (it managed just 137 yards against the Wolfpack), is 28-2?</em></p>

    <p>I previously blogged that i was going to try <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001609.html" title="a little ludwig goes a long way: Streetkeys.com">Streetkeys.com</a> to get a replacement key. well don’t bother, they don’t really seem to be able to offer the service they promise. without ever explaining why, they refunded our money and told us “we can’t help you”. We have to get a key the hard way now – have the car towed to a dealership and have the key cut and matched at the dealership. Sad.</p>
