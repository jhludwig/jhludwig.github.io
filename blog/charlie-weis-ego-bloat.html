	<title>Charlie Weis Ego Bloat – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="J pointed out to me there is a book about “Charlie Weis and Notre Dame’s Rise to Glory” which seems a little odd, since you generally need to both achieve glory and rise to have a “Rise to Glory”. I decided to do a little amazon sleuthing to compare Charlie with some other coaches who just maybe have a greater claim to a “rise to glory” given that they have won national championships – Tressel, Carr, Stoops, Carrol, Paterno. I’m looking for books with the coach’s name in the title, or where he gets an authoring credit of some form:

		<p>J pointed out to me there is a book about “Charlie Weis and Notre Dame’s Rise to Glory” which seems a little odd, since you generally need to both achieve glory and rise to have a “Rise to Glory”. I decided to do a little amazon sleuthing to compare Charlie with some other coaches who just maybe have a greater claim to a “rise to glory” given that they have won national championships – Tressel, Carr, Stoops, Carrol, Paterno. I’m looking for books with the coach’s name in the title, or where he gets an authoring credit of some form:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=br_ss_hs/002-9263046-5070411?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dblended&amp;keywords=charlie weis&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" title="Amazon.com: charlie weis">Amazon.com: charlie weis</a>. Sure enough, we have “The New Gold Standard: Charlie Weis and Notre Dame’s Rise to Glory”:amazon written by some 3rd party. And we have “Echoes of Notre Dame Football: The Greatest Stories Ever Told (Echoes of)”:amazon with a foreword by the Super Genius himself. But most damningly, we have “No Excuses: One Man’s Incredible Rise Through the NFL to Head Coach of Notre Dame”:amazon coauthored by “one of football’s greatest minds who has helped shape today’s game” – if you think today’s game is all about pillow soft defenses I guess. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-9263046-5070411?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=jim+tressel&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Jim Tressel</a> – just one book – “What It Means to Be a Buckeye: Jim Tressel and Ohio State’s Greatest Players”:amazon. Jim writes a foreword here, the book is not about him though. Kind of akin to the 2nd book in the Weis listings, the least self-aggrandizing title. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-9263046-5070411?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=lloyd+carr&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">LLoyd Carr</a>. Nada. Apparently people in Michigan can’t write. Or read. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-9263046-5070411?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=bob+stoops&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Bob Stoops</a>. Two titles, the obligatory “What It Means To Be A Sooner: Barry Switzer, Bob Stoops And Oklahoma’s Greatest Players (What It Means)”:amazon and “Heir to the Sooner Legacy: The Championship Story of Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops”:amazon written by some 3rd party. Apparently people in Oklahoma are doubly infinitely more literate than people in Michigan. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-9263046-5070411?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=pete+carroll&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Pete Carroll</a>. No “what it means to be a trojan” title, just a 3rd party championship season “Conquest: Pete Carroll And The Trojans’ Climb To The Top Of The College Football Mountain”:amazon title. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=br_ss_hs/002-9263046-5070411?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dblended&amp;keywords=joe+paterno&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Joe Paterno</a>. You don’t coach longer than Stoops and Tressel have been alive without getting a truckload of books written about you. Deservedly so. Some authored by him, most not. If I were to buy one, it would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quotable-Joe-L-B-Thalman/dp/0966877446/sr=8-7/qid=1159289414/ref=pd_bbs_7/002-9263046-5070411?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Quotable Joe</a></p>

<p>So I’d have to say – Paterno is the clear accomplishment winner – great accomplishments, long career, many books. Stoops, Tressel, Carroll all seem to be right in line with their accomplishments. Carr needs a better PR firm. And Weis wins the pompous bombast title – maybe he should be coaching defense instead of writing a fricking book.</p>
