			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Please please please – pretend you are a student and go out and attend a week’s worth of college visits at other institutions. I think you will find that there is a lot of mind numbing repetition across the presentations and tours. You all have study abroad programs, intern programs, food service, blue light security on campus, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>What is far more interesting to hear about is the unique aspects of your institution and the community you are in. And maybe a direct compare/contrast between your institution and your most direct “competitors”. And consider doing something different in your presentation than every other college; one school brought in a professor to talk with the kids, this was memorable; another school gave away ice cream sandwiches at the end of the tour, a simple gesture but the kids loved it.</p>

<p>I’d consider running two different info sessions and tours – one for first time college visitors, and one for people who have seen 2 or more schools already.</p>

<p>I guess what I’m saying is think a little more deeply about your audience and what they are going thru, and tune the presentation to them.</p>

				<p><p>* “Sunstroke”:amazon by Jesse Kellerman. Great story of a woman searching in northern Mexico for the truth about her missing boss. Great protagonist. Great supporting cast – I love the stonecutter. Very atmospheric. * “A Wicked Snow”:amazon by Gregg Olsen. Really choppy. Not a terrible story but uncomfortable to read. Where was the editor? Great cover blurb by lee child but I can’t fully recommend. * “Mission Flats”:amazon by William Landay. Police mystery set in Boston and Maine. A smalltime Maine chief of police gets involved over his head in a Boston murder conspiracy. Nice twisted ending tho I did anticipate it a little. * “Without Fail”:amazon by Lee Child. Reacher seems a little more fallible in this tale. Misses obvious clues early and often. And the bad guys show up way too late in the book, bad form for a mystery. So not the best reacher but still entertaining. * “Blue Light”:amazon by Walter Mosley. Twisty tale of alien consciousness, drugs, psychosis. Hard to tell what really happened and what was imagined. I found myself liking the characters more than I expected. * “Killing Floot”:amazon by Lee Child. Another slam bang jack reacher tale. Reacher rips the covers off a southern town conspiracy leaving a wake of bodies behind. Don’t screw with reacher. This series continues to be the best airplane books. * “From Fatigued to Fantastic!”:amazon by Teitelbaum. Good overview of chronic fatigue and potential causes and treatments. Not a cookbook, more of a collection of all the ideas around fatigue.</p>

				<p><p>* “Remainder”:amazon by tom McCarthy. The tale of a severely brain injured man attempting to recover his life. Vaguely promising premise but I could never really identify with the main or secondary character. Certainly a unique tale though. * “The Shia Revival”:amazon by Nasr. i am not very well educated on modern islam – sunni, shia, wahabi, sufi, all means little to me. this was a fine first book to read – explained enough of the history to understand the genesis of the various strains, and explains the regional politics that are intertwined with the divisions in islam. and brings it all forward to the current situation in iraq, iran, and the rest of the middle east. a very helpful text. i am sure this author has some biases, it would probably be smart to read a few more texts to get a start on understanding the current conflicts. * “Creative concrete ornaments for the garden”:amazon by Hunter. Nice intro to basic concrete techniques. Purely decorative uses, not for structural elements. * “About Alice”:amazon by Trillan. Short soothing sweet read about lifelong love. Quietly inspiring. Calming.</p>
