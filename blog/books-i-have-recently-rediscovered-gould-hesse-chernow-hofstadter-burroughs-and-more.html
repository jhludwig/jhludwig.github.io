		<p>I’m looking over a bookshelf that I haven’t looked at in a while and there are some books I really fondly remember there. (And also a lot of books I have no memory of.) I am reflecting on how I really want to spend my time reading — I want to read more of these impactful books, and probably read fewer of the ones that are basically junk food.</p>

<p>Some of the great titles that caught my eye:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sparrow-Novel-Book-ebook/dp/B000SEIFGO">The Sparrow</a> by Mary Doris Russell. What a great book exploring morals and culture and misunderstanding.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Party-Classic-Moncure-Pantheon/dp/0375706437">The Wild Party</a> by Joseph Moncure March. I am not deep into poetry but this is nothing but fun. I’ve read this several times.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fatal-Shore-epic-Australias-founding-ebook/dp/B006NKL884">The Fatal Shore</a> by Robert Hughes. Probably needs some updating but an unvarnished look at one aspect of the British empire.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mismeasure-Man-Revised-Expanded/dp/0393314251">The Mismeasure of Man</a> by Stephen Jay Gould. Everything by Gould is excellent, this may be among the most important.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Death-Liberal-England-1910-1914-ebook/dp/B075CMYJS6">The Strange Death of Liberal England</a> by George Dangerfield. A fascinating and literary history tale. The title alone makes this book 100x more interesting than most history books.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ron-Chernow/dp/0679438084">Titan</a> by Ron Chernow. Learned so much about the growth of Standard Oil, and all the good and bad along the way.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Tides-Tim-Powers-ebook/dp/B004LLII12">On Stranger Tides</a> by Tim Powers. Powers has written some powerfully entertaining stories, and never got the renown he deserved.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567">Godël, Escher, Bach</a> by Douglas R Hofstadter. I’d recommend this to everyone. Definitely a desert island read. UPDATE: a reader suggests this one has not aged well, I may crack it open again.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Education-Speculator-Victor-Niederhoffer/dp/0471249483">The Education of a Speculator</a> by Victor Niederhoffer. Gets mixed reviews but I think that is because people expect to learn investment secrets in here, which is not what this book is about. It is more about the human side of his life.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Screwtape-Letters-C-S-Lewis/dp/0060652934">The Screwtape Letters</a> by C. S. Lewis. Whether you are a Christian or not, this is incredibly insightful and engaging. I’ve read many times.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Princess-Mars-Edgar-Rice-Burroughs/dp/1949982998">A Princess of Mars</a> by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I am sure this has aged horribly and I should probably be embarrassed about this one. But as a kid, this was a great rollicking adventure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Bead-Game-Magister-Novel/dp/0312278497">The Glass Bead Game</a> by Herman Hesse. This hit me hard when I first read it, very introspective look at finding meaning and place in life.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d love to hear about books others have rediscovered…</p>
