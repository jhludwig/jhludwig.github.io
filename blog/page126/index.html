    <p>Some great ideas at <a href="http://duhblog.com:8668/duhblog/space/2003-07-08" title="DUH BLOG :: 2003-07-08">DUH BLOG :: 2003-07-08</a> about the evolution of digital cameras. Much discussion about how the digitization of photon capture lets you inject so much more processing and data capture – like why don’t we capture gps info, infrared info, etc at image capture time?</p>

<p>At the extreme I’ve often thought about a software-defined lens, where the entire lens and shutter construct is replaced by software, and at the front of the camera you have a photon capture service that records the incoming frequency and direction of all the photons. With this data, you could theoretically do all your focusing and other image manipulation as a post-capture process. I suspect there are some quantum mechanical issues with this, a physical lens does a lot of “computation”. But it is very interesting to consider how to evolve the camera.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/07/02/yet-another-collaboration-startup.html">Yet Another Collaboration Startup</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I was looking at the plans of yet another collaboration startup this week. Yet another interesting system to help people codify and automate collaboration. And yet another system that will die an unmourned death I suspect.</p>

<p>End users have voted over and over again in favor of ad-hoc collaboration tools – email, IM. We happily bounce messages back and forth to collaborate. But make us structure it just a little bit and we overwhelmingly reject the solution. We are just too impatient and short-term lazy to create a structured message, to use a more structured workflow tool, to do the upfront design work to create a collaboration app.</p>

<p>The same dynamic exists with spreadsheets and databases. The dominant use for spreadsheets is simple lists with some modest calculations. Databases would be perfect for this but we use spreadsheets because we can jump right in with no upfront design time, we don’t have the patience to do a little design upfront.</p>

<p>But I wonder if we can’t do a little better in email, perhaps drawing some inspiration from spreadsheets. When I collaborate in email, I am often making a list – a meeting agenda, a list of tasks we need to do, a list of questions we need answers to, a list of assignments. And then I’d love it if I could easily see status against that list. It would be nice if my email editting app would auto-recognize lists, and then track responses and status to list items, letting me see a summarized view of the list of items being discussed in a thread.</p>

<p>It has to be really lightweight, any list should be autorecognized and formatted, as Word does today if you try to create a list of items.</p>

<p>Just early thinking. I’d like to see some lightweight collaboration grow up from simple email, rather than continue to see heavyweight groupware software.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/07/02/partitioning-of-processing-power.html">Partitioning of processing power</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve been wondering a lot about the practical implications of the partitioning of processing power on the PC.</p>

<p>I’ve been dutifully buying machines with faster and faster <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/roadmap/index.htm?iid=ipp_browse process_roadmap&amp;" title="Intel? Products - Processor Roadmap">Intel processors</a>, I even bought a dual proc machine, and I have to say – the results have been underwhelming. All this processing power just seems to get sopped up by Windows, Office, all the taskbar cruft that programs and oems install, etc etc. As I have doubled and tripled the power available to me, my life hasn’t gotten a lot better.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I’ve also been adding processing power even faster to my video subsystem as I’ve kept up with the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=products">nvidia</a> and ati product leapfrogs. And I have to say – my computing experience has gotten visibly, materially better over the last 24 months, games are looking better by the month.</p>

<p>And so I have started to wonder about the “right” model for partitioning processing power on the PC platform. I am not wondering in computer science sense. I am wondering at pragmatic, social level. I wonder if creating a pool of dedicated processing power, not generally accessible to general purpose programs, has created an environment in which games have been able to move ahead faster. And I am wondering if keeping this processing power away from the general use pool, away from all the general purpose cruft on my machine, has in fact been the reason that games have been able to take off. If all game processing power was intermingled with the general purpose cpu, would we have seen the same rate of improvement?</p>

<p>I wonder if we wouldn’t be served by more special purpose co-processors. A network/security processor where all the code for firewalling, virus checking, intrusion detection, compression, etc could happen. A reliability coprocessor where dedicated code could be backing up, examining systems for failure, predicting problems, etc.</p>

<p>Certainly not a traditional view of how to evolve the PC but I wonder.</p>

    <p>Your tax dollars at work over and over and over again. We’ve been scanning all the national forest websites, looking for trail and camping info. For instance – <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/" title="Olympic National Forest - Olympic Peninsula Washington">Olympic National Forest - Olympic Peninsula Washington</a>, and the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/oka/">Okanagon National Forest</a>, and the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/">Gifford Pinchot</a>, and the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/mbs/">Mt Baker-Snoqualmie.</a></p>

<p>Now as a taxpayer, I love all this info online, it is a great resource. But do we really need to have completely different website designs and architectures for every single national forest? This is just a sample of the forests near us, how much redundant effort is happening nationwide?</p>

    <p>Another random idea for the day. I kind of wish my PC kept up a blog of its own. I’d like to see day by day – what software was installed, what errors occurred, what config changes were made. all nicely categorized, which a nice search interface. A web interface so i could see it from anywhere of course and permit others as necessary to see it. A nice xml interface of course, it would be fun to do cross machine analysis. Kind of a replacement for existing error logs and audit logs – call it an “error blog” or “audit blog” (ok i am trademarking those terms right now!).</p>

    <table>

    <tr>
      <td>For the first time ever, I went into the automotive electronics aftermarket, and had a [Kenwood Excelon Music Keg Digital Media Storage - KHD-CX910](http://www.kenwoodusa.com/product/product.jsp?productId=2373 “Kenwood USA</td>
      <td>Product - Kenwood Excelon Music Keg Digital Media Storage - KHD-CX910”) installed. 20G of music storage in my car, whoopee!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>But this is clearly a first generation product. I have a big VGA quality kenwood touch screen in the car, but I can’t browse an artist or disc list. I can just see the name of the current artist or current song – how lame is that! I can’t type in an artist name or song name and search to that – all I can do is play the next disc or the previous disc. Sucko. The only way to really use it is to just let the system do random play across your entire collection. Which is nice but it could be so much better.</p>

<p>Also the whole experience of plugging in aftermarket electronics is kind of a disaster. The good folks at <a href="http://www.innovativeaudio.com/main.html">Innovative Audio</a> did the best they could. But the wiring harnesses in modern cars are a proprietary mess – subsystem signals are all entangled in undocumented ways on shared harnesses, so that I can’t replace my receiver head without destroying my Onstar connection or my trip computer behaviour. I hear Mercedes is even worse, they use optical cable for the wiring harness, so there is no ability to attach in at all. It sure seems like the car companies are missing an opportunity here.</p>
