  <li>“The Cloud Atlas”:amazon by Liam Callanan. A little slow but builds nicely. A tragic tale set on the margins of WW II. Well researched. Ultimately I’m not totally sure I understand the main character’s behaviour tho, I can’t imagine most people enduring the abuse in this way.</li>
  <li>“The Innocent”:amazon by Harlan Coben. Ok but not his best work. A little too mary-higgins-clark-“I am your twin sister separated at birth”-ish for me.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The novel that means most to men is about indifference, alienation and lack of emotional responses. That which means most to women is about deeply held feelings, a struggle to overcome circumstances and passion, research by the University of London has found.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Men’s reading choices tend to identify themselves with novels that include intellectual struggle. Personal vulnerability is represented as a more or less angst-ridden struggle against convention, a sense of isolation from social normality.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Part of the reason for this, we decided, was that, to a far larger degree than women, men’s formative reading was done between the ages of 12 and 20 - indeed, specifically around the ages of 15 and 16. For men, fiction was a rite of passage into manhood during painful adolescence.</em></p>

    <p>Good discussions of the final tiebreaker puzzle over at <a href="http://crosswordfiend.blogspot.com/2006/04/well-so-much-for-that.html">crossword fiend</a> and <a href="http://crosswordbebop.blogspot.com/">crossword bebop</a>. Personally I sailed through the first 6 weeks and easily made it into the tiebreaker round. But today’s tiebreaker puzzle crushed me. I knew there was a nonstandard trick involved, but I didn’t figure it out in any kind of reasonable time. Hat tip to the mystery winner who may have just made a lucky guess at the right answer – if I had smartly applied game theory to today’s tiebreaker, I would have called in with an educated guess as well. I know that I am nowhere near the crossword solver that some of the participants are, my only chance to win would have been to make an educated guess. Someone did that and won, smart thinking.</p>

  <li>“Mr Midshipman Hornblower”:amazon by C. S. Forester. What a great yarn. And the first of a series of ten or so books. If you’ve exhausted all the current popular serial fantasy (Potter, Tolkein, Narnia, etc) and you need to branch out, this would be a fine series to read. Great for young male readers. Not so good maybe for young women – as a product of its times and its genre, there are few female characters of note.</li>
  <li>“I, Claudius”:amazon by Robert Graves. History comes alive! Impressive work of story telling and of scholarship. Makes roman history fascinating.</li>
  <li>“Holmes on the Range”:amazon by Steve Hockensmith. The “deducifyin’” of Holmes, as practiced by a cowhand in the historical american west. The author creates a very interesting set of brothers and does a nice job keeping in voice throughout the story.</li>

  <h1><a href="/2006/03/29/music-management.html">Music Management</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve been spending a fair bit of time with my music lately. Re-ripping everything I own in lossless format, and also trying a bunch of new stuff via <a href="http://www.lala.com">lala</a>. The amount of data involved now is substantial enough that I would be sad if I had to rerip everything. And we are a multi-listener, multi-ipod household, so I need to provide access to the music for multiple users. Here is what I currently do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acquisition. I rip everything in flac lossless format using <a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com/">dbpoweramp</a> using <a href="http://www.accuraterip.com/">accuraterip</a> to insure quality. I used to use <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">exactaudiocopy</a>, it is a fine program too, but I find the dbpoweramp interface a little cleaner. From this effort, I get an ever-growing store of flac-encoded content as I rerip all my cds.</li>
  <li>Conversion. Unfortunately the iPod doesn’t speak flac, and the ipod hard disks aren’t big enough to handle flac. So weekly I downconvert all my new flac content to mp3 using <a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com/">dbpoweramp</a> again. works pretty well in batch mode.</li>
  <li>Library-ization. I take the converted mp3 content once a week and add it to iTunes on one machine, and I let iTunes rename/reorg the files on this machine only. Because I am replacing old mp3s from previous rips, this sometimes creates some cleanup work for me – dupe files, etc. I’ve tried various strategies to limit he cleanup work but none of them work well.</li>
  <li>Fanout. To get the library on all machines, I currently use <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">beyondcompare</a>. It seems pretty fast and has an intuitive interface for me. I can save my various configs, it is pretty quick and painless to get everything in sync. this gives everyone a copy of the mp3 lib, and on their machines they can keep their own ratings, etc. Oh one key thing I also use – on my mac mini I have just started using <a href="http://www.hornware.com/sharepoints/">sharepoints</a> – makes it easy to share an arbitrary directory for network use by pc clients.</li>
  <li>Archiving. I also use beyondcompare to make a couple copies of the underlying flac storage, even though no one really uses those versions directly. I did install a flac filter on one machine so I could play the flac versions directly in WMP but I rarely do that.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next two things I intend to do are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add in another hard disk to the fanout/archiving mix, and rotate it to my office, so that I have offsite storage.I’ve already done this informally but I need to make it a core part of the process.</li>
  <li>look into how to export the itunes ratings from one machine to another. I personally use two machines and I’d like to keep the ratings in sync on those two. I’ve seen articles on how to do this, just need to dig in a little.</li>
  <li>I also need to start thinking about how to integrate multiple ipods for my own use. my music collection in mp3 format far exceeds the storage of the biggest ipod. so far I’ve been able to keep on top of this by rating songs and dumping all the 1-stars off the ipod automagically at sync time. but with all the lala-provided discs I am trialling, I have way too much music – I want to carry around all the songs I know I like, plus all the ones I have yet to listen to. Not sure what the right strategy is here yet.</li>
</ul>

    <p>* “Cities in the Wilderness : A New Vision of Land Use in America”:amazon by former interior secretary Bruce Babbitt. I alternate between hate and love for this book. Love the goals of better protecting and restoring our natural landscapes. Bruce is clearly smart and experienced. Hate the general bias towards big expensive governmental mechanisms. Love his willingness to repurpose existing agricultural entitlements to achieve his goals – seems pragmatic and efficient. Again tho hate the general bias towards massive government. I’d argue that the best government is a a very light, deft touch, with great leverage of the marketplace – for instance the Federal Reserve and its management of the economy. Sure wish smart policy thinkers would come up with an analog for managing our natural resources. Whatever, an interesting read by a smart guy. * “Tell No One”:amazon byt Harlan Coben. My second by Harlan, what a great twisty thriller. This guy can engage you. Stud. * “The Turn Of The Screw”:amazon by Henry James. Did I review this before? Good little horror tale. Never quite clear who is seeing what, what is real, what is imagined. Fairly stilted language but still does the job. * “Martian Time-Slip”:amazon by Philip K. Dick. Doesn’t age well. You are going to be more intrigued reading Bradbury (ages well) or reading more current authors. * “Cell”:amazon by Stephen King. Not up to the best of his “classic” period (It, Pet sematary,…). But a good modern scare. * “Life with Jeeves”:amazon by P. G. Wodehouse. Delightful. Plots for a dozen light romances in here. A joining of 3 books – a little long. But in small doses, marvelous. This would be a great book to leave sitting in a cabin – great for idle reading.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2006/03/08/college-basketball-point-shaving.html">College Basketball Point Shaving</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>The <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2006_03_01__arch_file.htm#114182749418260435">Sports Economist discusses</a> today’s NY Times article on the evidence for point shaving in NCAA basketball. Really, is it any surprise that 18-21 year olds can be swayed by a few thousand bucks, when they are working in an industry which generates hundreds of millions in revenues, none of which goes to them? Can you blame them?</p>

<p>Until the adults involved in college sports (the networks, schools, the ncaa, the sponsors) quit stuffing their own pockets and start sharing the revenues equitably with the people creating the value, leakages like this will happen.</p>

<p>Rant off.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2006/03/04/best-of-yakima.html">Best of Yakima</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK I have no idea if this is the best of Yakima but it is what I found in 4 days there:</p>

<p>* Where to stay – we stayed in the Hojo’s, it was merely adequate. Locals tell me that the Red Lion and the new Marriott Courtyard are nicer * Dining – <a href="http://www.zestacucina.com/menu/index.html">Zesta Cucina</a> was great! The find of the trip. Great atmosphere, and they handled our huge group (45+) well. We also dined at the <a href="http://www.olivegarden.com">Olive Garden</a> – it was yet another Olive Garden – and at Tequila’s – standard chain Mexican but in converted railroad cars downtown so kind of fun. Both the Garden and Tequila’s also did a good job with our mob. In all cases, do the restaurant a favor – have one person pay and figure out how to break it up later. * Lunch – El Grullense (near the Sundome) is a fine little taqueria. And Miner’s (also near the dome) is classic burger drive-in fare. * Recreation – well of course if you are there for a high school state tournament or a state fair then you will spend a lot of time at the <a href="http://www.fairfun.com/sundome/">Sundome</a>. Note that they have some fairly restrictive rules about fan behaviour for high school events so you might want to dig into it before you go - signs, bodypainting, too much standing, boomboxes – all prohibited. As is outside food of any sort. * Other recreation – the riverwalk along the Naches and Yakima rivers is a pleasant walk. And you can get into the Cascades to the west in a half hour for hiking etc. The <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/wenatchee/forest/formain.htm">Naches Ranger Station on Route 12</a> is a great place to stop and get current condition info, maps, etc. Based on my experience - bring snowshoes if you are heading out in early march, because there aren’t many trails clear yet.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2006/02/24/logitech-g5-mouse-and-g15-keyboard.html">Logitech g5 mouse and g15 keyboard</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>To match my new sli pc, i updated to gaming-optimized input devices – the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2142,CONTENTID=10715">g5 mouse</a> and <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2166,CONTENTID=10717">g15 keyboard</a>. The keyboard is cool – the little lcd display during games is very cool. I’ve seen this keyboard in action for months and finally had to get one. The mouse is also cool – the adjustable weights are awesome – i am running in the heaviest config right now but will see where i end up.</p>

<p>One huge beef tho – the lack of certified drivers. Not that I am anal about certification, it is just that install is a PITA as you have to wade thru a sea of warnings from MSFT that these drivers will make your PC break out in hives. Logitech is a big company, MSFT is a big company, why can’t they get their heads together and get this solved?</p>
