				<p><p>* “The Bottomless Well: The Twilight of Fuel, the Virtue of Waste, and Why We Will Never Run Out of Energy”:amazon – One of the better nonfiction books I have read in years. If you are thinking at all about energy policy, you should read this book. Its explanation of the energy economy in our society is lucid and insightful. I’d understood intuitively for years that to create the advanced products of our modern society – cars, computers, etc – you have to start with mountains of raw materials that get refined down into a small amount of useful goods. I hadn’t intuitively grokked that the same thing happens with energy – we start with gross amounts of highly chaotic energy (running water, burning hydrocarbons) and refine them down to the highly ordered, highly valuable electrons/photons used in computers, telecom, medical equipment, etc. These authors explain this in length, and clearly articulate how technology is pushing us even more towards an electricity basis and away from raw fuels. The authors take a light hand on policy recommendations but an obvious policy question to consider – would you rather have nuke plants built in our country, or our armed forces deeply engaged in battles in oil-rich parts of the world? It is probably not a direct tradeoff, but they are not unrelated choices. * “Under the Glacier”:amazon – this is a very challenging novel. deep references to the bible, to catholicism, to nordic myth, indian myth, and probably a thousand other creation myths, religions, and philosophies that i didn’t catch. the author was incredibly well read and wrote this in his 60s – i probably need to do another 20 years of reading to be able to begin to appreciate this novel. * <a href="http://listsofbests.com/news/#000054">Another list of great novels of the 20th century</a> – nothing shocking but a good reminder list</p>

				<p><p>It is all coming crashing down around me right at the moment. I don’t feel like I have gadgets and gear, I just have problems.</p>

<p>On my person/in my bag: my blackberry keys are sticking and i have to replace it, my casio digital camera won’t hold a charge.</p>

<p>In my car: the kenwood phatdisk hard disk is corrupt, my nav system is out for repairs.</p>

<p>At work: the vpn has become slow as mud, our firewall is crashing daily, my server box has only 256Meg of ram and is thrashing, i can’t quite configure properly my hosting service for 3 new domains.</p>

<p>At home: firefox 1.02 crashes repeatedly on my main machine. Firefox won’t run at all in user mode on the family room machine. I have hard disk corruption on my game machine. The hard disk in the PC I use to control all my halloween sounds is whining suspiciously. my 10 year old phone system is creaking as i attempt to slam voip into it.</p>

<p>A whole host of things are working ok – my ipod, my tivo, my comcast hd, the two other pcs and the mac mini at home. But the problems are all a little overwhelming at the moment. I may need to massively simplify. I can’t keep spending 3 hours a day fixing things…</p>

Maybe Myles Brand could give up some of his <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2005-01-24-myles-progress_x.htm">$738K in salary (2003)</a> to help pay a few players * And another older but great post from the Sports Economist talks about <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_02_01__arch_file.htm#110803672428396331">applying multipart tariffs to ticket prices</a> – I’m suprised these ideas haven’t been pushed further both at the high end of ticket prices and at the low end – maybe if the schools managed their yields better, they could afford to pay the players a little.</p>

				<p><p>In a boring meeting the other day, I was reflecting on how many ways people can get ahold of me. I did a little inventory.</p>

<p>Voice: You can call me at:</p>

<p>* 425 709 0772. Ignition central number. Accepts Voicemail * 425 460 0841. Ignition direct number. Accepts Voicemail * 425 922 7055. Cell phone. Accepts Voicemail. * 425 641 4973. Home listed. Accepts Voicemail. * 425 xxx xxxx. Home unlisted. Accepts Voicemail. * 425 xxx xxxx. Onstar in Chevy Avalanche. * 425 xxx xxxx. Vonage. Accepts Voicemail.</p>

<p>Fax: You dinosaur you, you can send me a fax at:</p>

<p>* 425 709 0798. Ignition * 425 xxx xxxx. Vonage.</p>

<p>IM: The younger set can reach me at:</p>

<p>* Jhludwig on AIM * Jhludwig AT hotmail.com on MSN (deprecated)</p>

<p>Email: My most used medium.</p>

<p>* ignitionpartners.com: john, jhludwig, johnlu. Actually a few more are also supported that I’ve set up over the years for various purposes. * fanblogs.com: John. For college football stuff * hotmail.com: jhludwig * gmail.com: john.ludwig * exmsft.com: johnlu (need to verify this still works) * attwireless.blackberry.net: jhludwig (direct to blackberry) * a few other domains i have registered which forward mail to me. * i never bothered to set up my comcast isp account, i guess that could work to, but don’t use it, since i never check it.</p>

<p>Text: again for the younger generation</p>

<p>* SMS me at the cell phone above * Or from a blackberry, send to Bberry pin 20053854</p>

<p>Blog:</p>

<p>* Send a trackback to an entry on theludwigs.com * Trackback or comments on fanblogs</p>

<p>Forums:</p>

<p>* Posts on MethodsofMadness halloween forum * Posts on some school forums</p>

<p>Redirects</p>

<p>* Ebay I believe will redirect messages to my account * All the social networking sites – linkedin, judysbook, friendster, orkut, etc – will send posts/messages to me</p>

<p>Physical mail:</p>

<p>* to ignition * to home</p>

<p>And well you can just Google “john ludwig” and probably figure out a way to get ahold of me. especially now that this is posted.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is – I will actually get all these. I monitor all these inputs on a semiregular basis. Some of them constantly, some more intermittently, but I get them all.</p>

<p>Contrast this situation with the beginning of my working life. I had 1 work phone, 1 work fax, 1 home phone at that time. No email, no sms, no cellphone, etc.</p>

<p>Will this explosion continue? How will people stay on top of it all? The big problem is really controlling use and access. Today I conrol access by deciding to whom and how I reveal these addresses. And then as the addresses leak out, I filter them for unwanted contacts. This seems pretty bass-ackwards. I’d like to be able to publish all of them freely, and then decide based on access lists and rules who is allowed to use which of them.</p>

				<p><p>I am certainly on the bleeding edge here – but in the next 5-10 years home cooling is going to get more complicated than it is today.</p>

<p>I’ve got 4 pcs, a network attached printer, various scanners and cameras, a vonage ata box, hubs, speakers, monitors, router, cable modem, and phone system in my office/server room. Naturally a hot room, but it has become unbearable on sunny days – and so I’ve had to add a dedicated air conditioner for this room.</p>

<p>My media center has a similar problem – the cabinet next to my screen contains a receiver/amp, directivo box, comcast box, dvd, vcr, ld player, etc. I’ve had to punch a hole in a wall and install a fan to vent out to the garage.</p>

<p>The heat generated by consumer electronics is just too much. (Attendant with this is the fan noise problem which can be addressed by clever heat sinks and other designs – but you can’t design away the waste heat).</p>

<p>If I was building a new house I’d explicitly design for these issues. Ventilation, extra thermostats, extra cooling capacity – it is a pain to add this stuff later. House HVAC design is going to get way more complicated.</p>

<p>We can do some things to address the problem – <a href="http://www.geekbooks.com/compact_fluorescent_light_bulbs_2005.htm">moving away from incandescent bulbs for instance</a> – I’ve done that in my problem rooms already. But the problem is just going to grow as we add more sophisticated electronics into our life – I am currently reading “The Bottomless Well”:amazon, on which I’ll write a full review later, but it is pretty convincing that we are going to have more waste heat, not less to deal with, in the future.</p>

				<p><p>I’ve given up on comcast <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001813.html">fixing their IP lease time issues</a>, I am still seeing very short lease times a week+ later.</p>

<p>I have found that my old sonicwall firewall was particularly perturbed by these short leases, so i replaced it with a <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&amp;scid=35&amp;prid=565">Linksys WRV54G</a> that I had purchased a while ago. No amount of coercion could make it work with the xbox tho – i tried port forwarding, turning on and off upnp, assigning the xbox a static ip and putting it into the dmz, etc. Just never clicked.</p>

<p>So I printed out <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/connect/routerlanding.htm">Microsoft’s advice on compatible routers</a> and trundled off to Fry’s this AM. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Microsoft’s list is very stale, not a single router with these model numbers is actually for sale anymore. So i picked up a <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=1&amp;pid=272">dlink DI-704UP</a> -- I know dlink has great market share, and the number was similar to a router that was supposed to be compatible. Works fine.</p>
