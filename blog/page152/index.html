I doubt that most people will want to run their answering machine on their pc. The voip answering machine service must emulate the features/availibility of existing answering machines or telco-based answering services – in both cases, easy access from a handset or multiple handsets in the house. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/2004/12/17/voip_at_home.html">Rich reminds me</a> that I don’t just want SIP phones in the house, i need PBX functionality so that extensions work like they should – ie all ring at once on an incoming call. * <a href="http://www.tippyturtle.com">Todd Duffin</a> is way ahead of me, he has done a lot. He’s had good experiences with the <a href="http://www.voipsupply.com/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=14&amp;products_id=33&amp;desc=Sipura%20SPA-2000%20SPA%202000">Sipura SPA-2000</a>, an <a href="http://www.iptel.org/ser/">SER server</a>, and asterisk for pbx/vm.

				<p><p>To take full advantage of the <a href="http://www.purenetworks.com">Network Magic</a> beta release (i’m on the board), I decided to upgrade my router/firewall from a sonicwall box I’ve had for 3-4 years to a Linksys gigabit ethernet router (i’ll be switching all my nics to gigabit nics as well – $29 for the cheapest GBE nics at fry’s).</p>

<p>The thing you must must must do – note the mac address of your old router first, because comcast ties your service to a specific mac address. I failed to do this and spent 10 minutes trying to figure out why my net wasn’t working and then noticed that my new linksys box was unable to acquire an address via dhcp. thankfully the linksys box lets you set its mac address to whatever you want, once i made this change, things were happy.</p>

<p>How regular humans will ever figure this out is beyond me. I guess they will call comcast. Why doesn’t comcast make this easy for their customers?</p>

				<p><p>When I first read last week about the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=fbi+computer+overhaul&amp;btnG=Search+News">problems with the FBI computer system overhaul</a>, I was pissed at our government. $170M wasted, now another $2M to consultants to figure out why. What waste – and in an important system.</p>

<p>On further reflection, this is such an immature reaction on my part. It is the easy reaction. Today, on inauguration day, I am reminded of JFK’s words – “Ask not what your country can do for you; Ask what you can do for your country.”</p>

<p>Our industry should be reaching out to help the FBI. We can’t expect the FBI to be expert at IT, or to be able to necessarily hire or evaluate the best IT staff or consultants. It is not the FBI’s core competency. The FBI needs to solve a really big database problem – I bet there are people at MSFT, Oracle, Google who know something about these problems and could help.</p>

<p>I’m not dying to help the FBI build some huge tracking database for every citizen – but if they have the legal mandate to build something, and are going to build it, I certainly feel like we should help them spend our tax dollars wisely and get a system that does something useful.</p>

<p>Anyway – just a reminder to myself – it is not the government’s job to solve all our problems – it is our responsibility to pitch in and help solve the issues in our society that need solutions or that we are uniquely equipped to help solve.</p>

Very artfully crafted, very engaging, a nice moral redemption of sorts for the main character. And some interesting early discussion on moral relativity that isn’t ever really fully explored. But…all wrapped up in a story that is so smutty and demeaning that it sinks the book. Maybe that is just my midwestern upbringing. All I know is that I’m embarrassed to have the book on my shelves. I’m not sad I read it, but I won’t pick up another book by Baker. * “A Coffin for Dmitrios”:amazon by Eric Ambler. What a fine fine tale. My first ambler, a great story of crime and human nature. I find it far more approachable than le carre, and far deeper than the popular crime and suspense novels of today. * “Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation, Second Edition”:amazon by Briggs et al. A fine reference. A little dated re browser details. Nothing probably to separate this from any other CSS reference, I just needed something reasonable.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/impressions-of-duluth">Impressions of Duluth</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">17 January 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Landed in Duluth at 9pm Saturday. Temperature on the ground: -20 degrees F. Airport has one ticket counter, a handful of gates, and a luggage carousel the size of a small bedroom.</p>

<p>Hey, everyone here sounds like Frances McDormand in <strong><em>Fargo</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Checked in to the brand new <a href="http://www.countryinns.com/duluthmn_north">Country Inn</a> near the airport. Very pleasant, brand new. A million kids in the hotel – hockey teams in town for a tournament. All running thru the halls in swimsuits to the indoor heated pool and slide – who knew I should bring a swimsuit to Duluth in January?</p>

<p>Watching the local NBC affiliate news was an education all by itself about northern Minnesota. The news anchor and the weatherman both looked to be about 24 – they are the backup team at the station – I guess if you are a new journalism grad, Duluth is the kind of market you can start in. The weather report was all about “how many consecutive hours will the temperature stay below zero”. Record is 160+ as I recall. We’re at 60+ now, the weatherman doesn’t think we’ll break the record.</p>

<p>Sports report – Div III college hockey, Div II college hockey, Div I college hockey, high school hockey, minor league hockey. Oh yeah at the end he mentioned the NFL playoff results.</p>

<p>Down to 24 below overnight. The building popped and cracked all night long – a constant battle between freezing weather and our room heater. And not a gentle popping and cracking – more like the last 30 seconds of a bag of microwave popcorn, all night long.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">14 January 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Just got one of <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php?masterid=3499797&amp;search=Sharp+lc-37gd4u">these</a>, in the course of a remodel. What a beast!</p>

<p>One astounding part of this beast is the i/o ports available.</p>

<p>Input: analog coax a, analog coax b, hdmi, dvi + stereo audio, component input 1 + stereo audio, component input 2 + stereo audio, s-video + stereo audio, center channel audio input, 2 I.Link (1394) terminals, digital coax in, a cablecard slot, and a regular pcmcia slot for content on pcmcia storage cards (or any format card or drive with a pcmcia adapter). Oh and an rs-232 control port, and power.</p>

<p>Output: s-video+stereo audio monitor, digital audio, analog coax, stereo speaker terminals, headphone jack, a dc output jack for unspecified future expansion.</p>

<p>I admit I have a perverse desire to hook something to every input and output just to see if the tv melts. The power consumption from a fully provisioned system must be immense.</p>

<p>More realistically I am going to try to get a cablecard out of comcast. I am going to see just what the pcmcia port can handle. And the dvi port is just screaming for a mac mini.</p>

<p>Microsoft is clearly making the right bet with Windows MCE (and here’s a <a href="http://www.matt-fletcher.co.uk/wiki/index.php?title=MCE_2005_-_Windows_Media_Center_Edition_2005_Resources">great MCE wiki</a>) but not clear to me that WinMCE will be the winning software on the tv computer. It is clear tho that there will be a pc in/next to the tv.</p>

The writers are excited about server-side, datacenter applications. Personally I get way more excited about consumer applications. So not many consumers need to run thousands of vms simultaneously on their machines – but cheap creation of ephemeral vms would be great, the end to spyware and viruses – just give me a new instance of my “known good” vm every time i sit down, and throw it away when i get up – any malware that managed to worm its way into the vm is gone.</p>
