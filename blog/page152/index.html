I particularly like, in the discussion of dark matter, his analogy of the sea – dark matter as the bulk of the undersurface water that we never see, “bright” matter as the small layer of frothy stuff on top we can see. A very humbling view of our position in the universe.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/08/19/toshiba-e740.html">Toshiba e740</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>PocketPC vs Blackberry</strong>. I’m carrying around a Toshiba e740 pocketpc now with built-in WIFI, as well as my blackberry. Some really blatant differences.</p>

<p>The blackberry has basically 2 control buttons – Affirmative, Cancel, and the affirmative button is also a scroll wheel. In addition there is a reset button hidden on the back and of course the keyboard. The PocketPC has 8 control buttons, one big switch, two recessed switches, a reset button, an eject button. I can’t tell you what all these buttons do. I know I couldn’t turn on the Toshiba for part of the day because the big switch was in the wrong position.</p>

<p>The blackberry has very limited software that does 2 things well – email and calendar, fully synched with my desktop. The keystrokes to do common operations in these apps are pretty optimized (tho could be even better). The pocketpc software is much richer but a lot more confusing.</p>

<p>The web just doesn’t work well on the pocketpc. It is great that I can even get to it, but no page i have gone to wraps correctly and so reading any content is painful. And javascript is not supported. The web is so clearly a PC phenomena.</p>

    <p><strong>Air Transportation Stabilization Board</strong>. As I read <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/atsb/">this</a>, about $1.5B has been guaranteed in loans to airlines so far, and there are several major applications outstanding. Most of this money goes to the bankers if the airlines fail as I read it. The damage from September 11 though is at a very individual level – families who lost members, and individuals who have lost or will lose employment as a result of the resultant economic upheaval. Seems like we ought to be directly helping these individual citizens rather than the corporate entities and the banks.</p>

And humanity has a problem fighting off aliens who have no weaponry, body armor, or hand to hand combat ability? Ok I am overanalyzing. My kids liked it. I had fun too.</p>

<p>It is interesting that we have these hugely capable graphics coprocessors in our PCs now. Why don’t we have similar network coprocessors? With all the demand for wirespeed packet analysis/transformation (secure vpns, personal firewalls for instance) at higher and higher wirespeeds, seems to me like we will need more compute power dedicated to network traffic. I haven’t done the math tho to convince myself of the need.</p>

    <p><strong>Permalinks Redux</strong>. Despite some misgivings I have added permalinks to my site. Convinced by email from <a href="http://webvoice.blogspot.com/">Olivier Travers</a>. I am very doubtful about my ability to maintain the permanency of these links over the lifetime of my blog, as I expect my blog to operate for the remainder of my natural life and I expect to change the underlying implementation many times. The blog community is young and the technology is young, I think we are all kidding ourselves about the durability of the chosen design point and syntax. Only time will tell.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/08/08/thoughts-on-permalinks.html">Thoughts on Permalinks</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Permalinks</strong> I am trying to decide whether to add permalinks to my site, and if so how to implement them. I have been slow to do so because I take a very long view of what the word “permanent” means. I want to implement a system that will last for 20+ years, during which time i will post a lot of content of all sorts, and i am sure that the system i use to manage content will change dramatically. I don’t want to have to recreate my entire naming scheme multiple times, that will kind of defeat the purpose.</p>

<p>I’ve looked at permalinks on a lot of other sites. There are some mistakes being made. For instance I have seen permalinks of the form “www.foo.com/GUID” where the GUID is 6 decimal digits. Seems like a lot but the history of software shows again and again that you need to allow way more address space than you originally imagine you will need. I’ve also seen permalinks of the form “www.foo.com/keyword/GUID”, with the author sorting their posts into several categories. I predict unhappiness here as categorization decisions and hierarchy will change over time. The right kind of permalink seems to be “www.foo.com/date/guid” which allows unbounded expansion and doesn’t embed unnecessary assumptions about categories or namespaces into the permalink.</p>

<p>I have a lot of resources besides just those i post in my blog that i want to be remotely accessible. like files. i wonder if the permalink convention should span them as well. the timestamp is a lot less relevant for these types of resources.</p>

<p>i wonder if permalinks are right at all. i wonder if a more durable interface is a search interface – ie a standard search submittal syntax for my site. this seems like it might let me futz with the underlying implementation a lot more.</p>
