  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Don-Eyles-ebook/dp/B07L9YQ9WV/">Sunburst and Luminary</a> by Don Eyles. Fascinating story inside the Apollo program, great depth on the software and compute environment. Most people will find this book a little too in the software weeds but I enjoyed it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Tomorrow-Brendan-Mathews-ebook/dp/B01MT5299R">The World of Tomorrow</a> by Brendan Mathews. Great story of three brothers in New York in the years before WWII, all working their schemes. Great characters.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Least-Believe-Still-Christian-ebook/dp/B00AZ3W2IU">What’s the Least I Can Believe and Still Be a Christian</a> by Martin Thielen. I was raised Presbyterian but it didn’t really take. I still tho got a lot of value out of this book, particularly the first half which debunks some of the worst behaviours of some “Christians”. Recommended for believers and non-believers both.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Divine-Vol-Faust-Act-ebook/dp/B015X9BE8Y">The Wicked + The Divine</a> by Gillen, McKelvie, Wilson, Cowles. I try a graphic novel every so often and this got good reviews. Didn’t really catch my attention, jumped in midstream to the characters and I didn’t ever bond to any of them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock-ebook/dp/B00RKO6MS8">Super Forecasting</a> by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner. Great book about forecasting and leadership. The basic rules resonate across so many fields – be tangible; measure performance; iterate. Really nice work.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Planet-Adventure-Chasch-Servants-Dirdir/dp/0312854889">Planet of Adventure</a> by Jack Vance. If you like Burrough’s Mars books, then you will like this. I read the Burroughs books when I was very young, and they have not held up well, but I loved them as a kid. And I kind of love this tho again has not aged well.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201715953">Introduction to Econometrics</a> by James H. Stock, Mark W. Watson. On my shelves for 16 years, not sure why. An average intro to regression analysis.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-World-100-Objects-ebook/dp/B0052RCX0G/">A History of the World in 100 Objects</a> by Neil MacGregor. Much better than I anticipated, a very readable and visual walk thru the entire span of human history.</li>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Three articles worth reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2019/12/01/the-tesla-model-3-invaded-my-neighborhood---but-its-bigger-than-that-gm-president-mark-reuss-take-note/#392f053d172f">The Tesla Model 3 Invaded My Neighborhood — But It’s Bigger Than That (GM President Mark Reuss Take Note)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/perspectives/gm-electric-cars/index.html">GM president: Electric cars won’t go mainstream until we fix these problems</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5c304e72-120a-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a">German car industry faces ‘day of reckoning’</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Owning a good EV is a transformational experience. Is my Tesla as good in all respects as a traditional car? No. But it is so dramatically better in a few regards that I will never go back to an internal combustion engine vehicle. And I don’t think this is discernible in focus groups or other traditional market research vehicles.</p>

<p>I am reminded of 1988 when I joined Microsoft. I sat in meetings with senior leaders from DEC who regularly pooh-poohed the PC. And they were “right”, the PC was primitive and incomplete. And in 10 years DEC was gone as an independent entity, despite their amazing technical and business strengths, despite being “right” in their judgement about the PC.</p>

<p>When the tide comes in, you don’t want to be trying to fight it.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/strategy-formulation-is-not-optional">Strategy formulation is not optional</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">07 October 2019</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>We get to spend two days with strategy consultants this week. I spent the first four years of my career as a strategy consultant and I have some perspective.</p>

<p>Strategy is not some task you do every once in a while as executives. Strategy formulation, implementation, testing, and revision is a daily, hourly task. The best operators in the company are deeply involved in it. Sales people are pitching your strategy, and getting data back from customers on acceptance, pricing, competitive alternatives, and unmet needs. Product people are implementing, identifying unexpected hurdles, and finding new innovations every day. Everyone is trying out competitive products, seeing competitive moves, every day.</p>

<p>Every day all this info needs to be processed by the org, and the strategy needs to adapt. Strategy formulation and reformulation is thus totally intermingled with operations, and the best orgs are incredibly nimble at incorporating all the daily data and evolving strategy.</p>

<p>Strategies created outside the operating team often fail because they are not realistic – they are not implementable, they don’t account for what is really happening in the technology or with the customers, they are uninformed by the daily competitive pressure the operating team faces. And the operating teams knows all this, and so doesn’t buy into the strategy.</p>

<p>While I was a strategy consultant, I was presenting some brilliantly conceived strategy to one of our senior partners, Tom. Tom had been in the consulting business a long time and had seen a jillion businesses. He listened to my presentation, and then said “this is all nice, but your strategy is what you ship”.</p>

<p>It was an aha moment for me that has stuck with me ever since.</p>
