  <h1><a href="/2017/03/25/we-dont-get-to-just-move-on-from-the-healthcare-discussion.html">We don't get to just move on from the healthcare discussion</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>The AHCA has failed and people are frustrated and tired. The Republicans want to move on. Trump wants to move on. Some Dems want to gloat. But there is no moving on from this discussion, healthcare is too central an issue in people’s lives.</p>

<p>The AHCA was a political construct. It was “designed” to meet the political objectives of Trump (meet his campaign promise of doing something fast, without regard to what that was) and the political objectives of the republican leadership (destroy Obamacare without regard to how). As a piece of policy, it was harmful to most Americans, and the design of the bill and the effort to pass it were slapdash and amateurish.</p>

<p>It was brought down by the conservative and moderate wings of the party – the conservatives wanted more free market structuring, the moderates didn’t want to hurt their constituents.</p>

<p>So, now what. We have a turned a corner in this country. The Frum article (https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/the-republican-waterloo/520833/?utm_source=atlfb) and Naam’s observations about the Overton window (https://www.facebook.com/ramez.naam/posts/10154105976537493?match=b3ZlcnRvbiB3aW5kb3csb3ZlcnRvbix3aW5kb3c%3D) are useful to read. The electorate has come to expect universal coverage at a reasonable cost (which is what Trump ran on though he was just being politically expedient). Plans that rip away coverage from the poor, from children, from young mothers – those will never get through.</p>

<p>And inaction on costs is not acceptable. People are paying too much for healthcare today. They are mad about it. The US has the highest costs of any developed nation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita). Failure to address the ruinous costs borne by the middle class and working class will result in midterm loss of Republican house seats, and turnover in Democrat seats as well.</p>

<p>The Republican leadership (or new Republican leadership) needs to accept reality. They can’t just throw up their hands, say “darn it”, and move on to their next dream of tax reform. There is plenty of room to work on costs and improve the functioning of the ACA – see Naam’s list (http://rameznaam.com/2017/03/25/healthcare-improvements-republicans-could-make/). There is plenty of room in a system with universal basic coverage to insert market dynamics. The Republicans need to turn their attention to these opportunities. The Democrats need to lead with reasonable proposals and support reasonable efforts.</p>

<p>No one can walk away from the healthcare discussion.</p>

Most fascinating to me was the description of their skin, with its color change capability, embedded photoreceptors, and highly distributed nervous system. I would have liked more cephalopod info.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Night-Novel/dp/0812988906">Last Days of Night</a> by Graham Moore. Fictionalization of the early days of the electrification of the country. Very interesting parallels to the tech booms of the last 30 years.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/eVolo-Skyscrapers-Visionary-Architecture-Design/dp/193874022X">Evolo Skyscrapers 3</a>. Wow, this coffee table book of imaginative future skyscraper designs could keep me occupied forever. Drones, fantastic trains, innovative green technology, disaster-resistance, extreme climates, etc. Super fun.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inevitable-Understanding-Technological-Forces-Future/dp/0525428089">The Inevitable</a> by Kevin Kelly. I avoided reading this for a while and I don’t know why. A little bloated but an excellent look at the forces of change that are driving through our economy. Highly recommended.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Nations-History-Regional-Cultures/dp/0143122029">American Nations</a> by Colin Woodard.  Very good and topical read.  I don’t think the boundaries between the nations are quite as crisp as he suggests but his model is very helpful for thinking about how the different parts of the country are thinking about politics these days.</li>

    <p>Been working on this for quite a while, our team is now part of Xevo (xevo.com). Very excited to join Xevo, the founder of Xevo is Satoshi Nakajima, former colleague at Ignition and at Microsoft, someone who I have long enjoyed working with. And the rest of the team at Xevo is just great, and they have a great existing position in the automotive market. We’ll be focusing our technology on solutions in this space which is exciting – real problems, the ability to deploy to tens of millions of customers, with very demanding technology at the forefront of the industry – machine learning, cloud, iot. Really looking forward to expanding our team, building the business, and making a difference.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2016/11/27/amzn-should-make-their-own-home-automation-gear.html">AMZN should make their own home automation gear</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I purchased a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0178IC734">TP-Link Smart Plug</a>, a top seller in home improvement, to control turning on and off our Christmas tree lights from our Amazon Echo. The final working solution is pretty slick, it works reliably, and it is pretty tolerant of slight differences in phrasing.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/11/amzn-should-make-their-own-home-automation-gear/%e6%89%93%e5%8d%b0/"><img src="images/HS100_us_V1_1134_normal_0_20151017175028-300x225.jpg" alt="打印" /></a>But setup was a long path of horrible. Create a tp-link online account. Download their Kasa iOS app (Really love the profusion of brand names – control our TP-Link™ Smart Plug with the kasa™ iOS app using the Alexa™ integration with our Amazon Echo™). Plug in the TP-Link device and then join it to the kasa app, doing the “private wifi hotspot” dance common to so many iot devices, where you have to leave the app and join a goofy wifi hotspot temporarily. Wait while the pairing happens. Then set a friendly name for the device in the kasa app. Go to the url in the paper instructions to set up Alexa integration. This points you back to a menu in the kasa app. This sends you back to a web page with Alexa integration instructions. Go two menus down in the Amazon Alexa phone app (why isn’t this the Amazon Echo phone app? I bought an Echo. I never bought anything called Alexa) to install a new smart home skill, the TP-Link Kasa skill. Search in the Alexa app for connected devices and pick the tp-link device. Provide the Alexa app with tp-link login credentials. Now I guess it is all set up but I have no idea what phrase to say. Take a guess that the friendly name I gave the tp-link device 8 steps ago is the thing to say, and yay it is.</p>

<p>I bet when I install a 2nd one I get to do much of this again. Kind of dreading that.</p>

<p>How will regular humans do all this? Return rates and support calls must be high. The tp-link should have been pre-provisioned with the necessary wifi connectivity, and the Alexa skill should have been pre-installed, and the phrase should have been pre-configured to a default. And I should have just plugged it in, and it should have worked in seconds.</p>

<p>If AMZN wants this to be a mainstream use, they need to preconfigure the devices, like they preconfigure Kindles or other AMZN hardware. Which probably entails AMZN building their own devices, or running a very strong branding/qualification program. Otherwise this is going to be a very niche experience. Or someone else (GOOG or APPL) will figure this out and displace the Echo.</p>

    <p>I find myself a little befuddled these days about our country. Some days I find myself feeling a lot of anger. The decision by a significant minority of our electorate to hand the reins of government to an unfit man, for the sake of unspecified change, is difficult to understand. But I can’t control what happens in distant places, I can’t control how people feel.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/11/lets-stay-positive-and-focus-on-seattle-and-the-west-coast/15032247_10103910583670978_4320759830836294903_n/"><img src="images/15032247_10103910583670978_4320759830836294903_n-300x225.jpg" alt="15032247_10103910583670978_4320759830836294903_n" /></a>What I can control is my own effort and time. And the real opportunity in front of me is to commit myself to making our local community and state an even better place to live. To be more tolerant, more welcoming, give more people a hand up, help create more economic activity, help more people who need help, etc. Seattle is a vibrant place, the state of Washington is an amazing place to live, the West Coast is a great region, but we are not perfect and we have more to do.</p>

<p>As a first tiny positive step, we’ll be attending the <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/events/24690938/peaceful-trump-response-join-hands-around-green-lake">rally at Green Lake this weekend</a> to stand up against fear and hate, and to show our support for the most vulnerable parts of the community. And we also want to demonstrate to local politicians that the community is committed to tolerance and civil rights, and that we will stand with local leaders to fight racism, sexism, xenophobia, etc.</p>

<p>I am confident that we can continue to make Seattle and the West a vibrant and attractive place to live, with great broad-based economies and great tolerance. We have much to do, but we have a great set of people here to do it with.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2016/09/19/weekend-software-project-audio-classification.html">Weekend Software Project -- Audio classification</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>This weekend I experimented with some audio classification tools. It was an up and down experience.</p>

<p>I’m interested in a couple features – hotword detection ala “Hey Siri”, “Alexa”; sound event detection (i.e. identify a glass break or gunshot); and acoustic scene classification. I didn’t dig into general speech reco, I’ve dabbled with that in the past.</p>

<p>I experimented with two projects this weekend – the <a href="https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy">Kitt.AI Snowboy hotword detection tool</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/TUT-ARG/DCASE2016-baseline-system-python">DCASE 2016 baseline system</a>. I spun up a single docker container that hosted both projects. This was a bit of a PITA, mostly due to getting sound devices to show up in a container. I should post something separate just on that adventure.</p>

<p>Ultimately I got them both working. The Snowboy detector works reasonably well with their universal model; the personal models you can create work also, tho they are not speaker independent. The DCASE code also spins up and training can be done on a standalone machine in a modest amount of time. Unfortunately, both these projects have very restrictive licenses, which makes them kind of useless for anything besides a weekend project.</p>

<p>At the root of almost all these systems is a common feature extraction algorithm, MFCC extraction. MFCCs are explained reasonably well <a href="http://www.practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/">here</a> and the author provides a <a href="https://github.com/jameslyons/python_speech_features">python reference implementation</a> with an MIT license. I’m inclined to dig more into this path going forward.</p>

    <p>What they are is anti-science establishment; they have lost trust in a science establishment that has allowed itself to be swayed by moneyed interests.</p>

<p>Consider <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html">today’s news on the sugar industry</a>:</p>

  <p>“They were able to derail the discussion about sugar for decades,” said Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at U.C.S.F. and an author of the JAMA paper.</p>

<p>There is just as much money swirling around pharma and around agriculture, you can bet that the science storyline has been distorted by this money. And that is what people are really saying when it comes to GMO or vaccines – they want to believe the science, but they can no longer trust the science establishment to tell an unbiased story. And science with a pre-determined agenda is no longer science.</p>

<p>We need a re-opening of science. We need far more transparency about funding. We need more funding independent of commercial interests. We need more open results – this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/28/eu-ministers-2020-target-free-access-scientific-papers">EU proposal</a> seems like a good thing. Above all, we need the science community to recognize the problem it has created, the loss of faith it has created through its own actions, and to take charge of healing itself.</p>

    <p>Another one of my rash kickstarter/indiegogo acquisitions, the <a href="https://nucleuslife.com/">Nucleus</a>. I purchased the two pack so I could use them to connect to each other.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/09/weekend-product-trial-the-nucleus-anywhere-intercom/nucleus-1/"><img src="images/nucleus-1-300x225.jpg" alt="nucleus-1" /></a></p>

<p>The units feel like cheap clunky ipads, which they kind of are, much cheaper than ipads. They only do a couple things tho – place a video/audio call to another unit or a phone running the app, receive a call, or act as an alexa device.</p>

<p>I played around with the unit standalone, as a paired set, and with the remote phone client. Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Way easier to set up than most iot products thanks to the screen, easy to set up the network.</li>
  <li>As an alexa front end, it is adequate. It works just like an Amazon unit, seems to support all the same commands. The speakers are worse than the Amazon Echo or whatever you might attach to an Echo Dot. I wouldn’t use this as a music player, but it is fine for responding to voice queries. Now we already have an alexa in our kitchen and having two alexa devices in the same room is not a good idea.</li>
  <li>As a receiver of calls from the mobile client, I kind of like having a dedicated always-on handsfree device. You can take a call in the kitchen without interrupting what you are doing. And having a dedicated device for the 75% most common call (ie spouse to home) is sensible. I can see some form of this scenario being useful.</li>
  <li>As an initiator of calls to a mobile client, it is useless. I need to have the mobile app open and running or I can’t receive calls.</li>
  <li>As a two-unit video intercom, I am not convinced. We do not have a small house, but I couldn’t figure out why I would put two of these around the house or where I would put them. We don’t have kids in the house, maybe I would like it more then. We do have a vacation place and so I placed one there so our two homes could be connected. However, internet connectivity at the vacation place is squirrelly and after a day, I could no longer connect to the unit at the vacation place. So that scenario isn’t working.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven’t thrown it all in a drawer yet like so many others I have trialled but it is not a part of our daily life yet either.</p>

</ul>

<p>Re the last book, I’ve been reflecting on science fiction as a genre. In recent weeks I’ve been feeling bad about the genre as writer after writer dismisses it in the NY Times – <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/books/review/daniel-silva-by-the-book.html">Daniel Silva</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/books/review/terry-mcmillan-by-the-book.html">Terry McMillan</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/books/review/jeffrey-toobin-by-the-book.html">Jeffrey Toobin</a>. One can argue that I shouldn’t care about these opinions, but still. One aspect I think these writers miss is the ability of speculative fiction to explore the societal impacts of technology, as I note in the book above, and I find this to be valuable and interesting.</p>

<p>I was also feeling a little annoyed at these writers for their blanket dismissal of a genre, that didn’t seem very clever to me. I was happy to read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/books/review/alan-moore-by-the-book.html">Alan Moore</a> this week, who just nails the key point that genre doesn’t have to be limiting at all:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m happiest when I’m outside it altogether, or perhaps more accurately, when I can conjure multiple genres all at once, in accordance with my theory (now available, I believe, as a greeting card and fridge magnet) that human life as we experience it is a simultaneous multiplicity of genres. I put it much more elegantly on the magnet. With that said, of course, there are considerable pleasures to be found in genre, foremost among which is that of either violating or transcending it, assuming there’s a difference, and using it to talk about something else entirely. Some subversions, paradoxically, can even seem to reinvigorate the stale conventions that they’d set out to subvert or satirize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every genre has bad writing, and bad genre writing is bad. I am going to dedicate myself to reading good genre reading, and especially writing that pushes the boundaries of the genre.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2016/08/29/weekend-software-experiment-facebooks-deepmask.html">Weekend software experiment -- Facebook's Deepmask</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/561187904071636">Facebook open-sourced</a> its <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/deepmask">Deepmask and Sharpmask</a> codebases last week for object segmentation in a scene. In the past I’ve tried traditional CV methods to do object masking, and it is kind of a disaster, you end up with a very finicky codebase full of heuristics and hacks, which fails as soon as it sees a new kind of image. Seems like an archetypical use case for neural nets. So seemed worth giving it a try.</p>

<p>Deepmask and Sharpmask come with pretrained models based on the <a href="http://mscoco.org/">COCO dataset</a>, it looks laborious to label a new dataset without benefit of some mechanical turk-like process, so I decided to stick with the pretrained models.</p>

<p>To avoid polluting my system, and to share with the rest of the team, I decided to bring this all up in a docker container. Because our build environment has some unique characteristics, I needed to author my own container, but these were excellent dockerfile guides: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kaixhin/cuda-torch/~/dockerfile/">Torch with CUDA</a> and it’s <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kaixhin/cuda-torch-deps/~/dockerfile/">dependencies</a>. Also <a href="https://github.com/torch/distro">Torch install</a> is a good reference.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/weekend-software-experiment-facebooks-deepmask/29-aug-2016-04-13-54/"><img src="images/29-Aug-2016-04-13-54.jpg" alt="29-Aug-2016-04-13-54" /></a></p>

<p>First results in the picture. Did a nice job on this image for the large objects. The biggest problem I had was running out of GPU memory. The machine I was using only had 4G of video ram and this constrains how large an image you can feed in. We had a bunch of 4K x 3K street images, I found that scaling them down to 756x567 allowed me to get them thru the classifier. My modified classifier that implements a size limit is <a href="https://gist.github.com/jhludwig/9d17d8c7abd2822f863ca8256ec3a82f">here</a></p>

<p>The classifier is slow, seconds to tag an image. It would be interesting to keep it resident as a demon, and to just emit the metadata instead of a modified image, and see if I could get a higher framerate. Also I want to play around with both a faster video card, as well as maybe an opencl implementation to get to non-cuda platforms. This is also my first lua code ever, I have no idea which part of this code is fast or slow.</p>

<p>This was a fun little project. It points out that, if software is eating the world, then ML is eating software. For a certain class of problems, a fairly generic neural net plus a dataset is going to be competitive with the best laboriously hand-coded algorithm.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2016/08/27/weekend-gadget-review-the-cocoon-not-recommended.html">Weekend gadget review -- the Cocoon -- not recommended</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>This morning I set up the <a href="https://cocoon.life/">Cocoon</a> I received this week – “Protect your whole home with Cocoon. Simple setup, HD video and audio, built-in siren, all controlled from your phone. Feel safe with Cocoon.”</p>

<p>Unboxing and setup – <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/weekend-gadget-review-the-cocoon-not-recommended/cocoon-box/"><img src="images/cocoon-box-300x193.jpg" alt="cocoon box" /></a>pretty standard box quality, nothing special about. Inside the box you get the Cocoon, usb cable and wall wart, some clunky international adapters, a stand, and a very small manual. While the manual was small, it was complete and clear.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/weekend-gadget-review-the-cocoon-not-recommended/cocoon-elements/"><img src="images/cocoon-elements-300x182.jpg" alt="cocoon elements" /></a>For wifi setup the Cocoon uses an audio scheme – the Cocoon app on your phone blurts a song out which the Cocoon listens to for embedded wifi credentials. It was pleasant and fast, and way better than a bluetooth dance or a private wifi hotspot dance. Up and running in minutes, this promise was met.</p>

<p>Apparently the Cocoon will use location services and when it knows you are out of the house (ie when your phone is out of the house), will “arm” itself and start watching for movement and listening for sounds. It will then alert you to anything, and you can connect to see the video snippets, and set off the alarm if you want (or call the police or whatever). I didn’t exhaustively check all this out, I mostly just played with the video.</p>

<p>And, well, video as a data type is hard. So many bits. So opaque. The promised “HD video” was not really HD, was very laggy (my guess is they are using something like HLS or DASH which guarantees lag), was corrupted at times, had a low framerate, sometimes didn’t show up over the LTE connection. I’d say that the Canary I’ve used in the past had better video.<br />
<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/weekend-gadget-review-the-cocoon-not-recommended/cocoon-subsound/"><img src="images/cocoon-subsound-169x300.jpg" alt="cocoon subsound" /></a> The Cocoon also has some feature called Subsound. I could not tell from the app screen what this was supposed to be doing. The website says it uses an infrasound microphone, geolocation, and machine learning. You can only see the app screen if you are at home. I guess this is to detect a broader array of movement or sound.</p>

<p>So…this is fairly expensive device. But with poor video. And a bag of other features which seem ok but not amazing. The economics on this thing are challenging to justify, if you want to see what’s going on in your home, a raspberry pi based system would be FAR cheaper tho of course you would have to futz with it yourself. The big downfall of this device is the poor video experience, at $400 I expect something pretty freaking amazing.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2016/08/17/intcs-arm-play-and-the-arm-ecosystem.html">INTC's ARM play and the ARM ecosystem</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>My best two investments this year have been NVDA and ARMH. NVDA’s been on fire, it was obvious when I attended their GPU Tech Conference that they were going to do very well this year. And Softbank’s play for ARMH has been rewarding.</p>

<p>All the growth in compute usage and capability has moved to non-Intel processor cores — GPU and ARM, both of which are better in different ways for the high growth compute issues of the day. Hard to imagine this changing, I’d expect to see even more GPU migration (or even on to FPGAs).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12507568/intel-arm-mobile-chips-licensing-deal-idf-2016">INTC’s ARM licensing move</a> is a sign that intel is fully accepting the reality here. I am sure Intel still has a lot of internal religion about x86 instruction set – but they shouldn’t hold back now. They should fully cast aside any religion about instruction sets, and just make sure everyone is opting to put an Intel part everywhere. Put an ARM core on every x86 processor — they certainly have the transistors, it would be great as a developer to have an ARM core at my disposal on my laptop. Put an x86 core on every ARM chip, it would be great to be able to use x86 code in more places.</p>

<p>Softbank meanwhile may have just enabled their biggest competitor. It is great to have Intel as a licensee, but there is no way Intel is going to accept a secondary position in the processor market, they are going to use their design skills and fab skills to try to coopt the ARM market. Softbank will need to ramp up their own ARM ecosystem efforts, probably with a deeper software and services play, or they are going to find themselves with less and less influence.</p>

You can try <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot">Windows 10</a>. And all of these require a lot of laborious tinkering.</p>

<p>To say nothing of the cloud, the services for managing ARM devices are even more nascent or non-existent.</p>

    <p>Comcast must love our household. We have to be in the top tier of cable subscribers – multiple TVs, all DVRs, the most premium and sports channels we can get. Partly inertia, partly because we have been economically fortunate, partly because I want to get all the live HD football I can get. Comcast marketers must sit around salivating about us and wondering how to create more customers like us (or at least hang on to us).</p>

<p>So why is the Comcast/NBC Olympics coverage the worst possible option for viewing live Olympics? The 100M dash was what finally killed me. CBUT had it live. I could have found it on streaming live. NBC and Comcast in their infinite wisdom showed it at who knows what time last night. NBC had far more important things to show like prelim heats of some 800M race, also probably on tape delay. We found 5 minutes of worthwhile content in the first two hours of NBC Olympic coverage, thank goodness we could fast forward through it all.</p>

<p>By any measure the traditional cable NBC Olympics viewing is the worst possible option, which is so strange given the pile of money I give Comcast each month. The clear message is “If you want to watch live Olympics, you should not choose NBC or a cable subscription”. <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2014/02/comcast_merger_editorial_carto.html">Comcast why would you treat your best customer this way?</a></p>
