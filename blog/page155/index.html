Similarly I want RSS news aggregation built into these so I can review new headlines the same way I review new mail.</p>

Tune to 95.7 here in the seattle market. the home of <a href="http://www.quick96.com/">quick 96</a>. sub-10 second snippets of songs, one after another, with a numerical tag announced for each. The most bizarre radio experience I have ever had.</p>

<p>Update: went off the air as fast as it came on. Replaced by KJR FM. a) I am sure this was all driven by economics I don’t have visibility into. b) Man does this tell me that the way we allocate spectrum is nuts – here is a piece of valuable spectrum that is being wasted away just because it is in the middle of the long-established FM band.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/05/29/klez-virus.html">Klez Virus</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Klez Virus</strong>. Wow this has been annoying. Rosemary’s mail address, unbeknownst to her, was used by the <a href="http://www.cert.org/current/current_activity.html#Klez">klez virus</a> on someone else’s machine as the forged sending address on klez propagation mail. As a result Rosemary received a pile of bounced mail, as isps around the world detected the klez infected mail and bounced it wrongly back to her. Double whammy – virus gets spread, and innocent people get mistakenly harrassed as the misidentified sender. At this point rosemary’s email id is hopelessly compromised (overloaded with incoming bounce mail) so she is going to switch to a new one.</p>

<p>It would be nice if it was possible to identify without a doubt who really sent a piece of email. And actually this is possible, if we all got certs and <a href="http://www.soltrus.com/english/digitalidhelpcentre/index.html">signed our email</a> for example. The cert infrastructure is hard to use tho and so this hasn’t happened. In the next 5 years something has to change though or we are going to suffer more and more of these kinds of attacks.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/05/29/cd-collection.html">CD Collection</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>CD Collection</strong>. Finally finished ripping my entire cd collection (about 1000 discs) to my server. 96k, wma encoding, and I convert to mp3 for appliances as necessary.</p>

<p>Great to be done. Has been a background task for the last month. You can see what I am currently listening to on the left side of the page in the playlist section. I’ve been using windows media player for all my ripping (because it is less buggy than a lot of the tools i have tried and has less ad-ware than products from real) but the web page playlist feature motivated me to switch to <a href="http://www.winamp.com">winamp</a> for playback.</p>

<p>I’d love to just get rid of all the cds now but I will have to rip these all again in 5 years or so when my hard disks are big enough to handle lossless uncompressed storage. So I’ll keep them around for a while.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/05/25/memorial-day-weekend.html">Memorial Day Weekend</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Memorial Day Weekend</strong>. We picked up some kayaks and a canoe this week and are having a blast tooling around the lake. Weather is marginal but as long as it is not pouring we are having some fun. We got our boats at <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI’s</a> big annual sale – man I am a sucker for REI.</p>

<p>OK so it’s not really boating unless someone ends up in the water. I drew the short straw this outing. As C exited the canoe at the end of the ride, the canoe destabilized and whoop! in I went. Lake Washington is cold in May but not unbearable. I think I’ll get out of the canoe first next time…</p>

<p>We need a way to store the boats on the dock during the summer. This seems to be the cadillac of storage systems – <a href="http://www.talic.com/intro.htm">Talic</a> – doesn’t look too weather safe tho.</p>

<p>The racks at <a href="http://www.seitech.com/trailerstorageracks.htm#Storage Racks">SEITECH</a> look a little more weather safe. We’re going to cruise the shore today and see what others do for storage.</p>

    <p><strong>Startup and Spyware</strong>. A bunch of utilities that purport to tell you what goo is running in the background on your system, most from recent print pcmag.</p>

Or on traffic they generate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agnitum.com/products/tauscan/">Tauscan</a> is another tool. Focused primarily on finding hidden trojan horse processes. Has an impressive db of potential trojans it looks for. It seemed to work OK, tho didn’t find any real problems with my system (good).</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/05/18/startup-processes-in-windows.html">Startup Processes in Windows</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Startup Processes in Windows</strong>. I’m helping my dad figure out how to shut off various strange startup processes in windows. AN incredibly common problem and incredibly stupidly painful to fix. In his case some reminder program about MSN internet service is nattering at him all the time.</p>

<p>The easy steps are to go to the Startup group in the Programs menu and get rid of any gorp you don’t want. A legacy from win3.x are the LOAD= and RUN= lines in system.ini.</p>

<p>But there is still a bunch of stuff running. Hmm. Ok now we go registry whacking. Run Regedit. Navigate thru the tree control on the left to the key named HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run (at least that is the name on Win2k). Examine the rightmost screen dad. If you’re not sure, don’t touch! Call me.</p>

<p>Ok now navigate to the key named HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. Same dealy.</p>

<p>Finally you may have to look a key named HKEY_USERS\[somelongnumber]\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. Same dealy.</p>

<p>When you are done, reboot and see if that helps! Oh and here is at least one site that lists the name of <a href="http://www.answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm">strange tasks</a> running in the background of windows and if you are supposed to touch them. There are others – try searching <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> with the name of the strange executable, or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/default.asp">technet</a>.</p>
