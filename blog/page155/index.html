				<p><p>OK the comcast dude dropped by and installed today. (A moment of hilarity as he insisted checking to see if my cable was properly grounded or not – a 10 minute tour of my wiring closet with both DirecTV and Comcast feeds in, and many feeds out, convinced him that he didn’t really want to dig into the grounding issue.)</p>

<p>First reactions – the UI is slightly cleaner than the older Comcast box I had. It is nice that they have hoisted HDTV content upto the main menu, it is way easier finding that content now. That is probably the biggest plus I’ve noticed so far. I can’t comment yet on season pass and other record functionality as I am waiting for the program guide to populate – why does it take so much longer than DirecTV.</p>

<p>The UI style is not very exciting – my 3 year old Tivo box still has a more compelling UI. Is this Comcast’s or Microsoft’s hand?</p>

<p>Setting the TV/Audio out settings requires you to enter a weird bios-like mode, totally outside of the normal ui and control environment, that is weird, and I had to do this as the box didn’t seem to default to reasonable HDTV settings.</p>

<p>Of course the huge feature is going to be recording of HD content.</p>

				<p><p>OK it has taken me a week to wrap my head around the latest goings-on at OSU re the football program – <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1919246">Maurice’s claims</a>, <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/football/football.php?story=dispatch/2004/11/14/20041114-A1-02.html">the car program (sub req’d)</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1922656">OSU’s invititation to the NCAA</a>, <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/story/7894911">Geiger and Tressel responses</a>, people <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/big10/archives/001976.php">calling for life bans and death penalties</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Man do I love college football, and OSU football in particular. It is in my blood. Been going to games at Ohio Stadium since I was a toddler. Father played and lettered for the Buckeyes. I have Woody’s autograph. Watched the ‘68 team win it all. Suffered thru the end of Woody’s career, the Bruce and Cooper years. Was at the Fiesta Bowl when the team won it all again two years ago. There is just nothing rational about my affection for the sport and for the Buckeyes.</p>

<p>But…Hmm…I have to say I have deep deep deep misgivings about the morality of college football. OSU brings in roughly $90M a year in athletic department revenue, and that is mostly from the football program. To keep things simple, let’s say that is $1M per scholarship football player per year (don’t whack on me about other sports, this is just a convenient ballpark figure).</p>

<p>That is just the on-the-books benefits to the university. You have the car program – 85 cars to everybody and their dog associated with the program. I am sure there are other benefits like this that come in to the staff. You have sponsorship and TV revenue for the top coaches. Is any of this controlled or limited by the NCAA?</p>

<p>And then the Big Ten and the NCAA make revenue off the top of TV packages and bowl/tournament proceeds.</p>

<p>Where does all this largess go? Great facilities. Support for other sports programs. Great salaries and comp packages for coaches, administrators, NCAA staff, Big10 staff. What flows to the players who we are all going to see? About a $15K annual benefit in the form of scholarship and room and board.</p>

<p>Do the players, who are the reason the money is coming in, have any representation in the allocation of the funds? No. Can they opt out of the system? Not really, the NFL won’t let them in. If you want to play football as an 18 or 19 year old with a chance to go to the NFL, you have to go to a college, whether you are interested in a college education or equipped to handle one.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, while you are at college, you have a full time job called “playing football”. It consumes a ton of time. You have to fit in your academic responsibilities on the side, and good luck finding time for a job to earn some spending money.</p>

<p>So this is the system that responsible adults have created and are running for these young men. Huge benefits flowing to the administrators of the system and to other bystanders, no representation for the players. Does this seem moral at all?</p>

<p>And then we attack the players and destroy their careers if they somehow get some small extra benefit or extra help fighting their way thru college. With the huge inequity between value creation and value distribution, do we really believe that the system is not going to be leaky?</p>

<p>Honestly the rational thing for me to do is to quit supporting the sport, quit watching it. The system is taking terribly unfair advantage of young adults. I am not sure I can quit tho, the emotional connection is so huge.</p>

<p>Perhaps I need to start investigating reform measures and how to get involved in grass roots advocacy programs for the players. They deserve a lot more out of the system than they are getting today.</p>

<p>* from <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/11/02/EditPlus.html">Gadgetopia</a> I found <a href="http://www.editplus.com">Editplus</a>. Love the integrated FTP support. * <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=8817">Firefox 1.0 release</a> – <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/003688.html?wbfrom=rss">irresponsibly</a> upgrading all machines now… * <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=686a7305-a1d1-4c15-b191-55fa4f084d25">Furrygoat points</a> to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=be596899-7bb8-4208-b7fc-09e02a13696c&amp;displaylang=en">MSFT error code lookup tool</a> – as he says despite the title this tool works for all windows error codes. * <a href="http://blogs.officezealot.com/marc/archive/2004/10/31/3238.aspx">Marc points</a> to a new version of <a href="http://www.thornsoft.com/clipmate6.htm">Clipmate</a>. Ok I didn’t really try this one, just posted here because it reminded me of WFW and the mods we did to the clipboard to support network sharing of clipboard items – boy was that a waste of time. * <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/10/30/TurboRisk.html">Turborisk</a> – a free classic. OK the opponents are braindead but it is free. * <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=07ab2f23-583c-4b84-af25-98b720ffcb25">Photostory 3</a>. Free. Haven’t tried yet but intend to… * <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/02.html#a1106">Udell talks about MSH</a> – this looks pretty cool. I waded thru the beta signup process and have my key so I can try later today.</p>

<p>And I’ll close on a good general point raised at <a href="http://www.microsoftmonitor.com/archives/004060.html">Microsoft Monitor</a> – <em>There is no reason why back-up capabilities shouldn’t be built into digital content software, even if consumers don’t immediately use the function.</em></p>

				<p><p>Been a busy couple of weeks…</p>

<p>* <a href="http://WWW.lostremote.com/archives/002971.html">Comcast deploying MSFT software</a> – how do I get on the trial? Will it work with <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001197.html">my existing fairly new comcast pvr settop box?</a> The comcast/moto provided software is so clunky, I would love an alternative. * Looks like a little ecosystem of <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=16505954-c444-4d24-aa94-475bb26c1c58">media center addins</a> is developing… * <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7685703146968882/">MSN remote record</a> will let you remotely futz with your media center box…</p>

<p>It’s too bad that it is so hard for consumers to get their hands on all the above – waiting for your cable company to roll the features out is no way to kickstart a market, nor is depending on new pc purchases. Contrast with the <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1719938,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532">Halo2 release</a> which is going to be a huge hit – consumers have an easy way to acquire the product.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: according to someone who should know re the comcast/msft offering, “This is not a trial ? it?s full fledged commercial deployment to over a million subscriber in Washington state. The software will be eventually downloaded to all set top boxes including the older stuff, but I would warmly recommend upgrading to Comcast?s new dual-tuner DVR with HD. It?s a steal at $9.95 a month and if you already have HD, it?s only $4.95. You can order it starting next week”. I can’t find it on the comcast web site yet but I’ll check daily.</p>

I guess I just found this book to be somewhat engaging. The most notable thing about the book is the unusual writing style – thoughts and actions from the viewpoints of multiple characters are intermixed, it takes some fine parsing to sometimes figure out what was action, what was thought, and who was doing it. Is this Saramago’s normal style or was it crafted for this book to convey the confusion and disorientation caused by the world-wide blindness? As far as the story itself, a parable about human nature, how quickly we can descend, and how people can still maintain dignity and hope – well it was a bit of a yawner for me, I think this theme is better explored thru reading actual history books and biographies of world war II or other episodes.</p>
