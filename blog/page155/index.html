				<p><p>OK it has taken me a week to wrap my head around the latest goings-on at OSU re the football program – <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1919246">Maurice’s claims</a>, <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/football/football.php?story=dispatch/2004/11/14/20041114-A1-02.html">the car program (sub req’d)</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1922656">OSU’s invititation to the NCAA</a>, <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/story/7894911">Geiger and Tressel responses</a>, people <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/big10/archives/001976.php">calling for life bans and death penalties</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Man do I love college football, and OSU football in particular. It is in my blood. Been going to games at Ohio Stadium since I was a toddler. Father played and lettered for the Buckeyes. I have Woody’s autograph. Watched the ‘68 team win it all. Suffered thru the end of Woody’s career, the Bruce and Cooper years. Was at the Fiesta Bowl when the team won it all again two years ago. There is just nothing rational about my affection for the sport and for the Buckeyes.</p>

<p>But…Hmm…I have to say I have deep deep deep misgivings about the morality of college football. OSU brings in roughly $90M a year in athletic department revenue, and that is mostly from the football program. To keep things simple, let’s say that is $1M per scholarship football player per year (don’t whack on me about other sports, this is just a convenient ballpark figure).</p>

<p>That is just the on-the-books benefits to the university. You have the car program – 85 cars to everybody and their dog associated with the program. I am sure there are other benefits like this that come in to the staff. You have sponsorship and TV revenue for the top coaches. Is any of this controlled or limited by the NCAA?</p>

<p>And then the Big Ten and the NCAA make revenue off the top of TV packages and bowl/tournament proceeds.</p>

<p>Where does all this largess go? Great facilities. Support for other sports programs. Great salaries and comp packages for coaches, administrators, NCAA staff, Big10 staff. What flows to the players who we are all going to see? About a $15K annual benefit in the form of scholarship and room and board.</p>

<p>Do the players, who are the reason the money is coming in, have any representation in the allocation of the funds? No. Can they opt out of the system? Not really, the NFL won’t let them in. If you want to play football as an 18 or 19 year old with a chance to go to the NFL, you have to go to a college, whether you are interested in a college education or equipped to handle one.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way, while you are at college, you have a full time job called “playing football”. It consumes a ton of time. You have to fit in your academic responsibilities on the side, and good luck finding time for a job to earn some spending money.</p>

<p>So this is the system that responsible adults have created and are running for these young men. Huge benefits flowing to the administrators of the system and to other bystanders, no representation for the players. Does this seem moral at all?</p>

<p>And then we attack the players and destroy their careers if they somehow get some small extra benefit or extra help fighting their way thru college. With the huge inequity between value creation and value distribution, do we really believe that the system is not going to be leaky?</p>

<p>Honestly the rational thing for me to do is to quit supporting the sport, quit watching it. The system is taking terribly unfair advantage of young adults. I am not sure I can quit tho, the emotional connection is so huge.</p>

<p>Perhaps I need to start investigating reform measures and how to get involved in grass roots advocacy programs for the players. They deserve a lot more out of the system than they are getting today.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://WWW.lostremote.com/archives/002971.html">Comcast deploying MSFT software</a> – how do I get on the trial? Will it work with <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001197.html">my existing fairly new comcast pvr settop box?</a> The comcast/moto provided software is so clunky, I would love an alternative. * Looks like a little ecosystem of <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=16505954-c444-4d24-aa94-475bb26c1c58">media center addins</a> is developing… * <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7685703146968882/">MSN remote record</a> will let you remotely futz with your media center box…</p>

<p>It’s too bad that it is so hard for consumers to get their hands on all the above – waiting for your cable company to roll the features out is no way to kickstart a market, nor is depending on new pc purchases. Contrast with the <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1719938,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532">Halo2 release</a> which is going to be a huge hit – consumers have an easy way to acquire the product.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: according to someone who should know re the comcast/msft offering, “This is not a trial ? it?s full fledged commercial deployment to over a million subscriber in Washington state. The software will be eventually downloaded to all set top boxes including the older stuff, but I would warmly recommend upgrading to Comcast?s new dual-tuner DVR with HD. It?s a steal at $9.95 a month and if you already have HD, it?s only $4.95. You can order it starting next week”. I can’t find it on the comcast web site yet but I’ll check daily.</p>

I guess I just found this book to be somewhat engaging. The most notable thing about the book is the unusual writing style – thoughts and actions from the viewpoints of multiple characters are intermixed, it takes some fine parsing to sometimes figure out what was action, what was thought, and who was doing it. Is this Saramago’s normal style or was it crafted for this book to convey the confusion and disorientation caused by the world-wide blindness? As far as the story itself, a parable about human nature, how quickly we can descend, and how people can still maintain dignity and hope – well it was a bit of a yawner for me, I think this theme is better explored thru reading actual history books and biographies of world war II or other episodes.</p>

I guess I just found this book to be somewhat engaging. The most notable thing about the book is the unusual writing style – thoughts and actions from the viewpoints of multiple characters are intermixed, it takes some fine parsing to sometimes figure out what was action, what was thought, and who was doing it. Is this Saramago’s normal style or was it crafted for this book to convey the confusion and disorientation caused by the world-wide blindness? As far as the story itself, a parable about human nature, how quickly we can descend, and how people can still maintain dignity and hope – well it was a bit of a yawner for me, I think this theme is better explored thru reading actual history books and biographies of world war II or other episodes.</p>

				<p><p>I have to say I am not very happy so far.</p>

<p>I am using the iPod with a windows laptop that has no cd drive. So first i downloaded iTunes 4.7 and installed (well, updated the version of iTunes that was on the machine).</p>

<p>then I attached the photo iPod. oops, doesn’t work, i also need to download the iPod updater, install, and reboot.</p>

<p>Reattach the iPod. It is auto updated. Then I need to detach it and plug it into the wall so it completes the reflash.</p>

<p>Reattach again. All my songs and photos are on a network drive and iTunes claims they are not available. Well they are. Looked all over iTunes for an option to force it to recheck availability. Never found anything, finally selected all of my tracks and told itunes to play them. after a looooong time, itunes finally decided all the songs were available.</p>

<p>detach and reattach the ipod photo. songs updated automatically. now i grovel thru the options dialogs to point it at my photos. looonnng time synching as it downconverts all my photos.</p>

<p>ok i don’t really want downconverted photos, i want the ipod to be a backup of all my photos. click the option to bring over full copies and resync.</p>

<p>ok finally i am ready. i hook the ipod photo up to my tv thru an aux port and try a photo slideshow. hmmm, the photos show up on the ipod photo, but on the tv i only see the first photo, it never changes.</p>

<p>sigh. will try again later today.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The <a href="http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?14@169.FDfGaOrDA9q.1@.689e0193">iPod support site has a relevant discussion</a> which seems to have made my slideshows work. So I am happier, the iPod is fully functional now. Still a total pain to set up tho.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000028.html" title="Adam Bosworth's Weblog: Evolution in Action">Adam Bosworth’s Weblog: Evolution in Action</a>: <em>The user interface customized itself to the users needs, location, and data in a dynamic way through the magic of dynamic page layout. Today, a full ten years later, most windows apps still don’t do that. But heck they are only 2 or 3 or 4 generations evolved. Services, in the last decade, may have evolved 600 times by now all in reaction to what they have learned directly from customer use.</em> A pithy observation. * From <a href="http://www.windley.com/2004/11/03.html#a1505">windley.com</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_7/102-4131696-2978514?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;node=13584001&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">Amazon’s Simple Queue Service.</a> Interesting that AMZN would offer such a general purpose service. * Jon Udell on the <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/29.html#a1104">myth of the one true device</a>. Very wise. People don’t really need or want convergence of devices – they do want convergence of data. * <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=61a44955-441b-4e20-b994-8ff8139e1aa1">The twilight of Passport</a>. Some people never thought MSFT should offer a general service for the web, some people thought Passport should just make it easy to have a single login for all MSFT sites – which is where it seems things are ending up. * Jon Udell <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/10/22/43OPstrategic_1.html">under gmail’s hood</a>. * I haven’t really dug into the <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=741">newsgator online feature allowing ratings on your site</a> but it seems like a great notion. I love the idea of spewing ratings around (for articles, restaurants, books, etc) and then letting someone aggregate them, rather than having to post my rating and content to someone else’s site. * From <a href="http://www.windley.com/2004/10/29.html#a1498">windley.com</a> again, a <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">web-based slide show system</a>. Hmm. How long til people can give up powerpoint and go to a server model? * <a href="http://www.beinsync.com/">Beinsync</a> -- one of the N services that lets you keep folders in sync across the net.</p>

				<p><p>…is not the presidential results. I am sure the country will muddle through whoever is inhabiting that office.</p>

<p>The thing that is of most local, immediate importance to me is the failure of I-884, the education funding initiative. I’m suprised about the totality of the failure here. Obviously the electorate does not like new taxes. It is obviously going to take way more effort to increase our educational funding – it is going to take unified statewide political support – both parties, all major state and federal elected officials – as well as private sector leaders to ever push any significant educational funding package through.</p>
