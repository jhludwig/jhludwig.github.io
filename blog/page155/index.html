			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><a href="http://www.openwave.com/us/news_room/press_releases/2003/20030915_opwv_reardon_0915.htm">Reardon</a> reminded me recently that I read a lot of books. I looked over <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/cat_books.html">the list</a> this year and was a little suprised myself. And what a lot of dreck in there, I wonder why I plow thru some of this.</p>

<p>But to save others from plowing thru the dreck, here is my short list of good reads this year. Some new, some quite old.</p>

<p><strong>Fiction</strong>:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312278497/qid=1081897958/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Glass Bead Game</a> by Hesse. 3/4s of a year later and I can still recollect vast swathes of the book as well as particular scenes. Well worth the time. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/103-6281811-4989432?index=blended&amp;keyword=The+Curious+Incident+of+the+Dog+in+the+Night-time">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</a>. Totally expected to hate it, thought it was just trendy, but this was a solid and memorable story. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802130208/qid=1082873989/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">A Confederacy of Dunces</a> by Toole. Great great characters, dying to be a movie. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/4770019572/qid=1084987282/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Musashi</a> from which I picked up <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001475.html">my favorite quote of the year.</a></p>

<p><strong>Non-fiction:</strong></p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm">The 9/11 Commission Report</a>. Again, every US citizen should read this. * And while you are at it, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Imperial Hubris</a>. At the very least, thought-provoking and internally consistent. * And lest these two depress you too much, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400041767/qid=1091718131/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig</a> for a view on a country and culture that is really screwed up.</p>

<p>Lastly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2004/12/01/273160.aspx">a nice post from LarryO about hiding complexity</a>. This sure feels like the reason a lot of software goes wrong…</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I picked this up based on <a href="http://www.tongfamily.blog">Rich</a>’s reco. So the first 90% of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-2817119-8833737?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Imperial Hubris</a> just pissed me off, I thought the author was just being an apologist for Osama, explaining again and again the rationale for his actions and the support he enjoys.</p>

<p>But the close of the books was great. Two messages. One, we are at war, let’s quit pussyfooting around, let’s apply the full weight of our force on a focused effort to win. Two, let’s at least have a discussion about the policies that have forced us into war – our energy policies, our support for autocratic regimes, our unflagging support for Israel. Maybe these are the right policies, maybe not, but let’s at least have a discussion and agree that they are worth a war.</p>

<p>I feel a little shamed that I am not sacrificing much personally in this war. Here’s <a href="http://www.windsofchange.net/archives/003234.php">a pointer again to a great post about how we can support the troops.</a></p>

<p>* <strong>Best</strong>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.cyberguys.com">Cyberguys</a>, <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a>, <a href="http://www.redenvelope.com">Red Envelope</a>, <a href="http://www.duluthtrading.com">Duluth Trading</a>. None of these sites are price leaders but they accurately report what they have in stock and what you can really get. I hate sites that promise stock they don’t have. They all report status well on orders and let you know tracking numbers, etc. Red Envelope does a really nice job of reporting when a gift has been delivered to a recipient. Amazon has had some site flakiness the last couple of weeks but still has been good. Oh yes, <a href="http://www.shutterfly.com">Shutterfly</a> should be in this list too, they have consistently gotten us our pictures in timely fashion – I can’t imagined wasting time printing pics myself. * <strong>Good</strong>. <a href="http://www.newegg.com">Newegg</a>, <a href="http://www.Organize-Everything.com">Organize-Everything</a>, <a href="http://www.Mountainmiser.com">Mountainmiser</a>. Sites a little harder to navigate than the best, and online stock reporting not as accurate, but good communication and we were able to work things out. * <strong>So-so</strong>. <a href="http://www.Abesofmaine.com">Abesofmaine</a> is a price leader, but their online inventory info is a sham – they claim to have everything but in fact…so they did call me and we were able to work out an order, and it showed up, but I don’t feel great about the experience. * <strong>Danger Danger</strong>. <a href="http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQgotopageZ1QQsassZcomputerstuffreeQQsorecordsperpageZ50QQsosortorderZ1QQsosortpropertyZ1">Computerstufffree on ebay</a> – will I ever see my product? Purchased weeks ago and no communication about shipping status, transaction status. I’m nervous… * <strong>Incomplete</strong>. <a href="http://www.coloradokayak.com">Colorado Kayak</a>, <a href="http://www.watchclick.com">watchclick</a>. Transactions pending…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">Rich</a> and I are having a running discussion about the iPod and Apple’s ability to continue to dominate this business. Certainly the development of a community of developers and partners as the above links illustrate is a powerful asset for Apple. As a 4 iPod household, I’ve certainly voted with my feet. But…it is not a very sticky experience, I could move all my media to a competitive player tomorrow and lose very little. A network of related apps and solutions might start to create stickiness.</p>

<p>I recently refreshed the posting to have the <a href="http://www.exclusiveresorts.com">correct url</a>, after being contacted by one of the co-founders, a nice guy.</p>

<p>I’d really love to be a customer, their sites look great. It just doesn’t work for us now tho because a) we have limited vacation times, driven by conflicting school and scholastic sports schedules, and b) we just love a couple places – <a href="http://www.konavillage.com/">kona village resort</a>, <a href="http://www.canyonranch.com/Tucson/index.asp">canyon ranch tucson</a> – and don’t have the time or motivation to branch out.</p>

<p>But if we could, exclusive looks great.</p>
