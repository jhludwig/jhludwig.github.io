				<p><p>Just got one of <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php?masterid=3499797&amp;search=Sharp+lc-37gd4u">these</a>, in the course of a remodel. What a beast!</p>

<p>One astounding part of this beast is the i/o ports available.</p>

<p>Input: analog coax a, analog coax b, hdmi, dvi + stereo audio, component input 1 + stereo audio, component input 2 + stereo audio, s-video + stereo audio, center channel audio input, 2 I.Link (1394) terminals, digital coax in, a cablecard slot, and a regular pcmcia slot for content on pcmcia storage cards (or any format card or drive with a pcmcia adapter). Oh and an rs-232 control port, and power.</p>

<p>Output: s-video+stereo audio monitor, digital audio, analog coax, stereo speaker terminals, headphone jack, a dc output jack for unspecified future expansion.</p>

<p>I admit I have a perverse desire to hook something to every input and output just to see if the tv melts. The power consumption from a fully provisioned system must be immense.</p>

<p>More realistically I am going to try to get a cablecard out of comcast. I am going to see just what the pcmcia port can handle. And the dvi port is just screaming for a mac mini.</p>

<p>Microsoft is clearly making the right bet with Windows MCE (and here’s a <a href="http://www.matt-fletcher.co.uk/wiki/index.php?title=MCE_2005_-_Windows_Media_Center_Edition_2005_Resources">great MCE wiki</a>) but not clear to me that WinMCE will be the winning software on the tv computer.

I’ll be digging into this month.</p>

<p>Other random halloween things that have caught my eye:</p>

<p>* Assuming i go to a centralized sound console like above, i’ll want a wireless remote for it. So i can change up the sounds from anywhere in the yard. Need to understan<a href="http://www.frontierdesign.com/products/tranzmain.html">d these wireless mixer controls</a> better. * <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000623.php">Shapelock moldable plastic</a> seems like to could be great for making a lot of props, gravestone elements, etc. * I used some of <a href="http://homeseer.american-data.net/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=HS&amp;Category_Code=ZWAVE">these zwave controllers</a> this past year. way more robust than x10.

Games aren’t anything to write home about. * <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Acrobat Reader 7.0</a>. Recommended. Loads much faster than prior versions. * <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/12/movable_type_3.shtml">MT 3.14</a>. I don’t really notice much but it was an easy upgrade. * <a href="http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm">Tag&amp;Rename 3.2Beta</a>. Yawn. Complicated and wasn’t very good at figuring out tags for my mystery tracks (mostly classical cds or low volume compilations) * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/internet/2004/12/16/a9_for_firefox.html">A9 toolbar for firefox</a>. Works fine but I just can’t get in the a9 mood. * <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/microsoft_antis.html">MS antispyware beta</a>. Recommended – found a couple problems on my machine that others hadn’t, and has free signature updates. * <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=708">Tweaks to speed up firefox</a>. Despite the caveats, they worked for me. * <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20041209_spell_check_for_firefox.phtml">Spell check for firefox</a>. I’m usually ok on spelling but a nice tool to have. * <a href="http://www.truelaunchbar.com/download.html">True Launch Bar</a>. Nice that it is a transparent upgrade to the quicklaunch bar. But a little overpowering.</p>

<p>Software I’d like to try:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/01/great_smallware.html">Great smallware list</a>. I love these little utilities. * <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2004/12/46_bestever_fre.html">46 best freeware utilities</a>. Another good list. * <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/01/04/Sokkit.html">Sokkit</a> -- solves a need for me, easy install/config of AMP on windows.</p>

<p>Intriguing readings on software:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2004/12/public_ontologi.html">Public ontologies</a>. I don’t think end users will ever put keywords/classifications on all their output – but I do think a shared public ontology that can advise free text searching is pretty useful. When I search for “theatrical lighting control”, i’d love it if the search engines could benefit from the collective wisdom of the net and realize that “dmx” and “dmx-512” might be useful synonyms for my search, for instance. * <a href="http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2004/12/great_probabili.html">Bayesian tutorial and code</a>. Cool. * <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000738.html">p2p in 15 lines of code</a>. Unstoppable. * One man’s advice on <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/12/safe_personal_c.html">how to better secure your system</a>.</p>

				<p><p>Motivated to post this by someone who saw my gear bag and asked where to get one. I carry a bag from <a href="http://www.duluthtrading.com/store/catbrief.asp">Duluth Trading</a> – designed for tools but I use for carrying around all my gear. (I use them for tools too – one for pneumatic, one for electric, one for electronics, etc).</p>

<p>In the bag or on my person I carry: * <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">Blackberry 7210</a> with ATTWS service. I’m not going to move to one of the 7100s, I like the full keyboard * <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/">iPod Photo</a>. The photo functionality is lame but at least I have a backup of all my photos now. * <a href="http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/er6.asp">Etymotics Er6</a> earphones. Love these. Theyv’e been very durable. * <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001447.html">JVC subnotebook</a>. The best subnotebook I could find when I looked months ago. There may be better choices now. I like a subnotebook because I can easily carry it anywhere.

				<p><p>I’m setting up a new machine soon, and mostly for myself, I’m documenting the full software set I need on the machine (or will need access to:)</p>

<p>* OS: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx">Win xp pro</a>. I use the remote desktop feature a lot within the house and between house and work, so XP Pro is necessary. I’m also evaluating <a href="http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html">KnoppMyth</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx">Windows MCE 2005</a> as I may use one of them on a media center machine soon… * <a href="http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_index.php">AVG antivirus</a>. The price is right. * <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> of couse, tho I keep IE around to run WinUpdate and Outlook Web Access. ..and I have a lot of firefox extensions loaded, but the must-haves are Adblock, Tabbrowser Preferences, Download Manager Tweak, Googlebar, Searchkeys, and EditCSS. * <a href="http://www.aim.com">Aim</a>. I don’t have a love affair with AIM but other family members are committed to it, so I am too. * <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe reader 7.0</a>. The latest version is worth the download as it loads a lot faster. * <a href="http://toolbar.yahoo.com">Yahoo toolbar</a>. Ok I don’t actually care about the toolbar but the free spyware detector which is included makes the download worth it. * <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a> for bittorrent downloads. There are probably codec sets I need to download as well but I have forgotten them all, I will have to rediscover. <a href="http://www.kcsoftwares.com/index.php?vtb">Videoinspector</a> is helpful in discovering what codecs i need. * <a href="http://www.apple.com">Itunes</a> of course, as I am an iPod user. For ripping I use <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a> and the codecs implied. * <a href="http://www.pkzip.com/">PKzip</a> or any other reasonable file compression/decompression utility. * <a href="http://desktop.google.com">Google Desktop</a>. Actually I am not sure that I have to have this or not, it is still in the evaluation stage. The idea is nice – but in practice I never seem to use it. * <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857931033.aspx">Outlook</a> for accessing work email. Don’t love it but it is a fact of life. Back when I was wearing the CIO hat for Ignition I tried to move us to some other server alternative but calendar management and people’s familiarity drove us back to exchange and outlook. * <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">Newsgator</a> for feed reading. * <a href="http://www.cloudmark.com">Cloudmark</a> for spam control (ignition is an investor in cloudmark). * one of <a href="http://www.dzsoft.com/">DZsoft</a>’s tools for structured editting. Pretty lightweight which is all I need. I also use <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>. Oh and <a href="http://www.byedesign.freeserve.co.uk/">Spread32</a> is a nice little spreadsheet – I honestly don’t need most of the function of office.</p>

<p>While I don’t need these installed on every machine, I would feel remiss if I didn’t mention <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movabletype</a>, <a href="http://www.activestate.com">Activestate Perl</a>, <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com">Blogrolling</a>, and <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com">Sitemeter</a>. I use these tools every single day, in many ways they are more irreplaceable than most of the desktop software I use.</p>

				<p><p>I need to meet a good audio engineer with practical theatre experience, I am willing to treat you to a great lunch or dinner to start.</p>

<p>I have some ambitious goals this year for my halloween haunt sound systems. This past year I had 7 separate stereo tracks running – 4 looping from cd players, 2 from a pc synched with some effects, and 1 pair of speaks driven by a handheld mic and voice modification box.</p>

<p>This year I’d like to yoke them all together into a single soundsystem, driven by a single pc/mix source, and then I’d like to be able to switch dynamically between several configs:</p>

<p>- all speakers playing a single surround track. So I can have ghosts or other invisible things moving thru the courtyard - speakers broken into pairs playing stereo tracks – so i can play the loops as i do today - any speaker pair carrying the wireless mic track – so my voice can move from the tree to the coffin to the graveyard</p>

<p>I don’t want to spend a billion dollars on this of course. Ideally I could put a couple cheap sound cards with 7.1 or 9.1 support in a pc, drive them both from some pc program, and have a remote control (or a remote control program running on a pocketpc or some other device) that would let me switch configs around on the fly.</p>

<p>I need a basic education on what is really possible – what software exists today to dynamically control a large speaker setup, what devices i need to learn more about, etc. I’ve started to grovel thru mags and internet sites and I can probably figure this out myself eventually but the right conversation with the right person would save me a lot of trouble…</p>

				<p><p>“Sweet and Vicious”:amazon by David Schickler. An entertaining yarn. Reminds me of “Pulp Fiction” with an injection of Forrest Gump sweetness. Reads very much as if it wants to be a movie or was written as a screenplay – and the author gives thanks to his film agent among others, certainly suggests an eye towards a film.</p>

<p>“Ammonite”:amazon by Nicola Griffith. A lot of common modern science fiction themes here – all female society, a symbiotic organism/virus that sinks into humanity and creates an enhanced species, gaia, first recontact with a lost colony – all put together in a compelling story, a nice effort. I picked up at a Border’s on the big island that had a huge selection of less popular but critically acclaimed science fiction from female authors. Must be an interesting buyer at this store – certainly a more distinctive collection than at your normal bookstore.</p>
