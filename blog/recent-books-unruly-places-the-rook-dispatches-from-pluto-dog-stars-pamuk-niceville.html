	<title>Recent books -- Unruly Places, The Rook, Dispatches from Pluto, Dog Stars, Pamuk, Niceville – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="
  Unruly Places by Alastair Bonnett. The stories behind some of the most unusual and unlikely places on the globe – places belonging to no nation, to many nations, floating, underground, in the sky – and an understanding of the meaning and importance of place.  Enjoyable.  
  The Rook and Stiletto by Daniel O’Malley. Great suspenseful adventure in a world filled with magic –  kind of a grown-up Harry Potter milieu.  The first page grabs you – the protagonist awakens with no memory, in a park surrounded by bodies, and in her pocket is a note that says “Read Me”. Stiletto isn’t quite as strong but still a fund read.  
  Dispatches From Pluto by Richard Grant. An English adventure writer decides to settle in the Mississippi Delta. Interesting look at the culture and issues of a part of the country that seems almost foreign to me.  
  The Dog Stars by Peter Heller. A different kind of post-apocalyptic novel, the world has largely been emptied out, a very few people try to find their way and remain human.  
  A Strangeness In My Mind by Orhan Pamuk. Tried to lift my literary sights, but as always, “Nobel Prize Winning” does not equal “interesting”.  
  Niceville by Carsten Stroud. Not a nice place. Solid horror/mystery.
