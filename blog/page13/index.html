				<p><p>I was asked this recently. I draw from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/section/books?action=click&amp;contentCollection=arts&amp;region=navbar&amp;module=collectionsnav&amp;pagetype=sectionfront&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">NYTimes Sunday Book Reviews</a>. I especially enjoy the “By The Book” column, in which a living author talks about what they have read and are reading. Always some things off the beaten path there.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/reviews/">LA Times</a> book reviews are useful as well.</li>
  <li>Various prize lists – Hugo, Nebula, Man Booker, Pulitzer, Nobel, Edgar. Tho I have found the Nobel prize winners to be rough rough going.</li>
  <li>Goodreads reviews and Amazon reviews. If a book doesn’t get great consensus reviews (or at least a strong positive rating from a subset of readers), I probably won’t read.</li>
  <li>I have a couple coworkers/friends who are big readers and I listen to their recos, and my college roommate is a voracious and critical reader, and I listen to him. And then anything that a family member recommends, I will consider.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will read just about any genre with a couple limitations. I find most popular business books to be horrible – 1 or 2 good ideas that are worthy of an article, but nothing worthy of a book. And I do not enjoy farce in any genre, just not my thing.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Season-Broken-Earth/dp/0316229296">The Fifth Season</a> by N. K. Jemison. A small set of related characters finding their way on a far-future(?) Earth peopled by humans and human derivatives, littered with the artifacts of past civilizations, undergoing yet another seismic/volcanic reshaping. Of course there is some conspiracy at work. Good tale, characters dealing with painful issues.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/06/recent-books-29/connectography/"><img src="images/connectography.jpg" alt="connectography" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Connectography-Mapping-Future-Global-Civilization/dp/0812988558">Connectography</a> by Parag Khanna. How the world is moving beyond nation-states to clusters driven by interconnectivity. Well written and a lot of maps, and I am a sucker for maps.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruins-Gorlan-Rangers-Apprentice-Book/dp/0142406635">The Ruins of Gorlan</a> by John A. Flanagan. Pretty standard YA fantasy, but fun nevertheless. I’d read more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Call-Novel-Yannick-Murphy-ebook/dp/B004MMEIVE">The Call</a> by Yannick Murphy. Eh, what started out as a clever structural gadget became tiring. I am a little curious to know what happens to the family but I gave up.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Novel-Kate-Atkinson-ebook/dp/B008TUQ60G">Life After Life</a> by Kate Atkinson. I like Atkinson, but this book also became tiresome, tho I managed to finish. But I’d recommend a different Atkinson.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farthing-Small-Change-Jo-Walton-ebook/dp/B002LA0ANO">Farthing</a> by Jo Walton. How did I miss this? Conspiracy, murder in the English countryside in an alternative history where Britain made peace with the Nazis. Excellent.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Those-Who-Wish-Me-Dead-ebook/dp/B00FPQA76Q">Those Who Wish Me Dead</a> by Michael Koryta. A boy witnesses a murder, and, well, shit happens. Fun but not memorable.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Little-Lies-Liane-Moriarty-ebook/dp/B00HDMMISA">Big Little Lies</a> by Liane Moriarty. Completely fun story of conflicts between parents at a preschool, hilarious but serious. Apparently coming to HBO, this will be fun</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burglars-Guide-City-Geoff-Manaugh-ebook/dp/B00V35U0TM">A Burglar’s Guide To The City</a> by Geoff Manaugh.

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rosie-Project-Novel-Graeme-Simsion/dp/1476729093">The Rosie Project</a> by Graeme Simpson. Very engaging tale of a man with Asperger’s who fights to build a life for himself. Very enjoyable.</li>

Fantastic story of a misanthropic obsessive genius and how he impacted family and friends around him. An incredibly unlikeable and yet sympathetic main character. Very good.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Day-Ellie-McEnroe-Novel-ebook/dp/B00RKQ657E">Dragon Day</a> by Lisa Brackmann. Solid detective tale set in modern day China, where it seems everyone is out for their own advantage, and justice is a hard thing to find.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Souls-Nights-Masque-ebook/dp/B005411EL4">The Alchemist of Souls</a> by Anne Lyle. Fantasy set in the early days of the New World exploration, with a New World quite different than ours, peopled by a non-human race. Entertaining, not sure I am driven to keep up with the series tho.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Birds-Charlie-Jane-Anders-ebook/dp/B00W190RPG">All the Birds in the Sky</a> by Charlie Jane Anders. It’s the end of the world, maybe, and two childhood friends come together to save it, one with a deep science background, one with a deep mystical background. Good characters but I felt it kind of dissolved into mystical goo.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chimera-Parasitology-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B00X47ZY9S">Chimera</a> by Mira Grant. The last in a 3 book series about semi-intelligent and autonomous tapeworms invading human beings. OK it was fun at times but probably 1 book too long.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Victoria-Vanishes-Peculiar-Crimes-Mystery-ebook/dp/B0013TPXD6">The Victoria Vanishes</a> by Christopher Fowler. Fun tale of two aging detectives investigating a very very strange set of murders. I’ve read another in series, solid characters.</li>
