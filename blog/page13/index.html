Fantastic story of a misanthropic obsessive genius and how he impacted family and friends around him. An incredibly unlikeable and yet sympathetic main character. Very good.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Day-Ellie-McEnroe-Novel-ebook/dp/B00RKQ657E">Dragon Day</a> by Lisa Brackmann. Solid detective tale set in modern day China, where it seems everyone is out for their own advantage, and justice is a hard thing to find.</li>

Fantasy set in the early days of the New World exploration, with a New World quite different than ours, peopled by a non-human race.

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forty-Thieves-Thomas-Perry/dp/0802124526">Forty Thieves</a> by Thomas Perry. Now this was more fun, a husband/wife PI team run into a husband/wife assassin team, both trying to resolve a cold case. Bullets fly.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Planetfall-Emma-Newman/dp/0425282392">Planetfall</a> by Emma Newman. Ok this started out slow, a group of colonists on a new planet, but it went very strange, with a strange alien experience, and twisted humans.</li>

				<p><p>My last batch of books were very good, and so my bar is raised. I couldn’t get through either of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Witch-Lime-Street-Seduction-Houdini/dp/0307451062">The Witch of Lime Street</a>” by David Jaher. This gets great reviews, but is incredibly choppy, and the characters are unappealing, or to be precise, the author does a poor job of introducing them in appealing fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning-Machine/dp/0465065708">The Master Algorithm</a> by Pedro Domingos. This falls into the classic trap that many books of this type fall into – in its attempt to make a technical topic more interesting to a broader audience, it dumbs down its treatment of the topic, and is simplistic and repetitive. And so pushes away readers who have more background. It is obviously hard to achieve the right balance, I could not stay with this book.</li>

Recommended by almost everyone else in the family, this is a great tale of the UW crew team which went to the Berlin Olympics. Especially interesting probably to Seattle residents, but very well written. I had no idea that crew was such a popular sport at the time.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phishing-Phools-Economics-Manipulation-Deception/dp/0691168318">Phishing for Phools</a> by George Akerlof and Robert Shiller. OK I have great empathy for the material, an expose of how we are manipulated and deceived (and how we buy into this). But the book honestly was a little thin, I would have liked more examples and depth.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slade-House-Novel-David-Mitchell/dp/0812998685">Slade House</a> by David Mitchell. Lord can this man write, I love everything he touches. A great creepy haunted house tale, written in the Mitchell style. Hard to put down.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ember-Ashes-Sabaa-Tahir/dp/1595148035">An Ember in the Ashes</a> by Sabaa Tahir. Yet another dystopian YA trilogy, but well written and very enjoyable.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Mercy-Imperial-Radch-Leckie/dp/0316246689">Ancillary Mercy</a> by Ann Leckie. Third in the series and it is still holding up. Fascinating far future tale of empire and intrigue with a very unique set of ideas about identity.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Verificationist-Novel-Donald-Antrim/dp/0312662149">The Verificationist</a> by Donald Antrim. Very well written, the self-absorbed main character is having a breakdown or trip, and you are along for the ride.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moxyland-Lauren-Beukes-ebook/dp/B01922I24M">Moxyland</a> by Lauren Beukes. Eh, near future spread of technology through the less developed world. Some nice ideas but ultimately bored me.</li>

  <p>We eat pancakes to escape loneliness, yet within moments we want nothing more than our freedom from ever having so<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2015/12/we-promise-ourselves-that-we-will-know-better-next-time-than-to-order-pancakes-in-any-size-or-in-any-amount/veri/"><img src="images/veri.jpeg" alt="veri" /></a> much as thought about pancakes. Nothing can prevent us, after eating pancakes, from feeling the most awful regret. After eating pancakes, our great mission in life becomes the repudiation of the pancakes and everything served along with them, the bacon and the syrup and the sausage and coffee and jellies and jams. But these things are beneath mention, compared with the pancakes themselves. It is the pancake—Pancakes! Pancakes!—that we never learn to respect. We promise ourselves that we will know better, next time, than to order pancakes in any size or in any amount. Never again will we be tempted by buckwheat or buttermilk or blueberry flapjacks. However, we fail to learn; and the days go by, two or three weeks pass, then a month, and we forget about pancakes and their dominion over us. Eventually, we need them. We crawl back to pancakes again and again.</p>
