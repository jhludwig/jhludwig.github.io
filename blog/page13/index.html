I think they were super thoughtful about the whole process, and I’m excited to see the product, I am of course a backer.</p>

<p>And it has become clear to me what Kickstarter is really for. It is not about raising money. These guys raised a modest amount, they could have funded this easily themselves or from friends. But they have built a great community of early adopters and backers, who feel like part of the team, who are going to help evangelize the product, who are influentials. And that is what Kickstarter really seems to be about (for tech products, I am clueless about movies or other domains) – it is in some sense a marketing expense, it is the way you reach out to the influentials and early adopters and get them on board and pulling for you, which is a HUGELY valuable asset for a young company. It is certainly not about the cash – the $147K these guys raised, less the Kickstarter and AMZN fees, is nothing compared to the funding needs of the business.</p>

    <p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/firmin.jpg"><img src="images/firmin.jpg" alt="firmin" /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Stories-American-Literature-Series/dp/1564786021/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371093344&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=joseph+mcelroy">Night Soul and Other Stories</a> by Joseph McElroy. I just don’t enjoy short stories. These seem well-written and intriguing, but the lack of plot and character development due to the strictures of the form just doesn’t work for me. Giving up.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Portobello-A-Novel-Ruth-Rendell/dp/B0076TP3C8/ref=sr_1_27?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371913745&amp;sr=8-27&amp;keywords=ruth+rendell">Portobello</a> by Ruth Rendell. Given the author I expected a straight up mystery but this is an odd little tale of characters along Portobello Road and their obsessions and delusions and misbehaviors. Enjoyable but not hard-hitting.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Dervish-House-Ian-McDonald/dp/1616145455/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373382811&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+dervish+house">The Dervish House</a> by Ian McDonald. Somehow in my trip through the science fiction canon I have missed McDonald, and that has been a mistake. A good tale of a near future Istanbul awash in nano tech. The characters and ideas were much better than the plot, the story got a little too Dan Brown-ish in parts for me, and overall there were too many moving parts. A better book is in here, focused on just 1-2 of the characters and their stories. But still, a good read.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Firmin-Sam-Savage/dp/0385342659/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374076534&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=firmin">Firmin</a> by Sam Savage. I had no memory of why I bought this book, but what a quirky little tale. A hyper intelligent rat aspires to rise above his essential rat nature, with inevitable triumphs and crashing failures. Not unlike our own lives. Enjoyable.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last book reminds me of how valuable it is to search out small publishers and see what they are emitting. <a href="http://coffeehousepress.org">Coffee House</a>, <a href="https://www.graywolfpress.org">Graywolf</a>, etc. With the consolidation among the major publishers and the collapse of retail book selling, you can’t rely on the mainstream to bring interesting writing to you.</p>

<p>This was the first shipping product I worked on at Microsoft. A great great team of people.

We were just trying to make networking work within Windows, because up to that point, networking install for Windows was a ball buster.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/07/09/mail-hold-scam.html">Mail Hold Scam</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>So we haven’t received mail for about a week and I stopped at the post office, a 1 month temporary vacation hold was placed on our mail. The hold was placed at the USPS website, anyone can do this, there is no security. They had my name and address correct tho they supplied a NYC cell phone number as a contact number. Or maybe it was just a random number.</p>

<p>So I am trying to figure out if this is some sort of scam, was someone intending to pick up my mail (because no valid ID was demanded to pick it up), or were they planning on having it redelivered somewhere (tho the hold order had it being delivered at the end of the month to my address)?</p>

<p>Or was this just a db error at the post office?</p>

<p>I don’t seem to find anything on the internet about vacation mail hold scams but very curious.</p>

<p>We had a very nice visit at <a href="http://www.firwoodfarmalpacas.com/">Firwood Farms</a> today, this place is an unassuming little gem. Way off the beaten path, and not very commercial, but a hugely nice and good couple who own the place and make a home for rescue alpacas (as well as some of their own). And the alpacas are so engaging, very interested in meeting us (we did have food in our hands), and not shy a bit, tho a little cautious. Their eyes are stunning. This place is about 1000x more meaningful and touching than any zoo. Worth a side trip.</p>

    <p>However you feel about Snowden’s actions, whether he is a patriot or traitor, brilliant or naive, you have to give him credit for having the balls to take a stand. <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bunnyhat.jpg"><img src="images/bunnyhat.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/insouciance/" /></a>He has put his life and liberty at risk for something he believes in. He has thrown away his career, his relationships, his home, everything. I’m not completely sure how I feel about all his actions, though I have a strong bias towards more openness and more government accountability and more transparent oversight. But I certainly admire his courage.</p>

<p>Contrast with <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/06/intelligence-committee-wyden-snowden-came.php">members of Congress who apparently were afraid to break a subcommittee rule.</a> Gosh, what happens if you break a subcommittee rule, do you have to sit at the wrong table at lunch, or do you lose your parking pass, or do you have to wear a funny hat on Thursdays?

    <p>To address my ADSL woes, I am considering getting Dish Satellite Internet Access. I’m already a Dish TV customer so this seemed like it would be the easiest path.</p>

<p>My physical dish location is 40 feet from my house though, and I need to make sure I have the right cable in the ground before the Dish installer shows up.</p>

<p>After 4 phone calls with Dish, I finally found someone that purportedly knew the cable requirements. They told me that I would keep my existing dish with its RG6 coax cable for tv, and that I would have a 2nd dish with cat5 cable for the Internet. The 2nd dish part sounds fine, but cat5? I would have expected to run another rg6 cable to a modem in the house.</p>

<p>Anyone a dish Internet user?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Finally found a knowledgeable dish technician, solid copper RG6 is the correct requirement. this is what hughes requires as well, so it makes sense to me. I just couldn’t believe that dish would run cat5 (not even cat6) outdoors, and put the modem outdoors at the dish.</p>

    <p>ios7 first impressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the mail app i think i will like, seems a little easier to dispose of messages, and viewing messages is a lot cleaner</li>
  <li>i never used game center, mostly because i don’t care about the feature, but a little bit because it was so horribly ugly. nice to see that fixed</li>
  <li>sometimes you can be too subdued and too flat. the weather app doesn’t work for me, the difference between a sunny and rainy forecast is now so muted.</li>
  <li>all the new swipe from the bottom, side, etc behavior will take a while to get used to. tho quick access to airplane mode is nice.</li>
  <li>i’m interested in the new photo library features and sharing, tho at first glance, the whole collection thing doesn’t really work for me. collections are too small or too big.</li>
  <li>i hope i can airdrop easily between my mac and my phone. haven’t tried that yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>osx first impressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>laggy. wish i hadn’t installed. i am sure it will get better.</li>
  <li>maps app is cool i guess tho i will have to see how much i use it versus the browser alternatives. the “send to iOS” feature will be great, obviously not a new idea, but still i will be happy with.</li>
  <li>i suspect i will like finder tabs a lot. tags? i just don’t know. evidence from other domains suggests i won’t use them.</li>
  <li>books, keychain – yawn. hard to get excited about when there are great 3rd party solutions that work everywhere.</li>

    <p>What’s disgusting you? Personally, I’m not upset with</p>

<ul>
  <li>The tech companies who may have delivered data to the government. When someone from the government shows up with a warrant, regardless of your feelings about the nature of the warrant, you pretty much have to comply. You assume the legal process is working correctly, and you comply. And if you see any reasonable flow of warrants, you do engineering work to make sure you can comply with warrants in the future, without compromising all your other users.</li>
  <li>The NSA and other entities who went thru whatever legal processes exist to get various court orders. They are doing their job. And as one observer notes:</li>

<p>And I am pretty happy with</p>

<ul>
  <li>Snowden. Shining a light on these activities is good. A brave (and perhaps naive, but still brave) man. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/edward-snowden-in-hong-kong/276692/">James Fallows</a>’ article seems sensible.</li>
  <li>The press. Ditto. I am very glad we have a free press that digs and digs and digs.</li>
  <li>The members of the <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021149079_nsadelegationxml.html">Washington congressional delegation</a> who have voted against FISA.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not so happy with the bulk of our elected representatives who have hollowed out the 4th amendment, who think that secret briefings of Congress is sufficient oversight, who think that the 3 branches of government can balance each other without transparency or any citizen oversight, and who now call the actions of Snowden “reprehensible”. The President right on through most of Congress are out of step with me and many Americans.</p>

  <li>I think I will end up loving <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>. I shift my work across a lot of machines and being able to bring my entire dev environment with me seems like a great thing. Really this is the way I’d like all my apps to work. In case you are not clear why Vagrant is good, here is a snippet from their site:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re a developer, Vagrant will isolate dependencies and their configuration within a single disposable, consistent environment, without sacrificing any of the tools you’re used to working with (editors, browsers, debuggers, etc.). Once you or someone else creates a single Vagrantfile, you just need to vagrant up and everything is installed and configured for you to work. Other members of your team create their development environments from the same configuration, so whether you’re working on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows, all your team members are running code in the same environment, against the same dependencies, all configured the same way. Say goodbye to “works on my machine” bugs.</p>

Northwestern &gt; Vanderbilt. UM, Wisconsin, Illinois, PSU in top 50. OSU, MD in in top 60. Purdue, Rutgers, Minnesota, Iowa, MSU in top 75. Florida is first SEC showing (after Vandy) at 54, Georgia at 63, A&amp;M at 65. It is kind of a rout in favor of the Big10 actually. Gee just said the truth. Might be painful and indiscreet but seems true.</p>

W. Brands. A fine biography of FDR. The title led me to believe that it would be a little more focused on the conflict between his policies and the monied elite, but it was really a general biography of the most influential president of the last century.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Strangers-Child-Vintage-International/dp/0307474348/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352238&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+stranger%27s+child">The Stranger’s Child</a> by Alan Hollinghurst. Snooty acclaim but I am giving up. The “oh my gosh they were secretly gay” idea just doesn’t do it for me anymore, you can’t carry a story on this point, it’s like trying to revolve a story around “he was secretly left-handed!”. Maybe 30 years ago this would have been interesting. Not now.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maske-Thaery-Jack-Vance/dp/0743475240/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352290&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=maske+thaery">Maske: Thaery</a> by Jack Vance. Classic 70’s science fiction, some sort of Vance appreciation society is pulling these out of the back catalog and getting them out in e-book form. His characters seem stilted and awkward, age hasn’t treated them well, and yet a compelling tale.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-5th-Wave-Rick-Yancey/dp/0399162410/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352338&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+5th+wave">The 5th Wave</a> by Rick Yancey. Beginning of a YA series about an alien invasion of Earth, appealing due to the shades of gray in the characters. I’d read more.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lucky-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590175751/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352374&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lucky+jim">Lucky Jim</a> by Kingsley Amis. Eh. An over-ambitious grasper stumbles his way to success. The character is unappealing and I just don’t get him. Supposed to be funny.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-High-Crusade-Poul-Anderson/dp/1439133778/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352462&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+high+crusade">The High Crusade</a> by Poul Anderson. What a great fun book, a piece of classic science fiction that has aged very well. A blast.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Across-Sky-Nancy-Kress/dp/0765359561/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352600&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=steal+across+the+sky">Steal Across the Sky</a> by Nancy Kress. A nice concept but the story doesn’t go particularly anywhere.</li>

    <p>I recently left my Kindle on a plane, and now I have to get a new one (or migrate to ipad or whatever, the device used is not the point).</p>

<p>I’ve purchased 515 books over the years and read many of them. It is a disaster getting just my unread or currently-reading books over to a new device. The “Manage your Kindle” web page has no indication of read status, I have to go through each title and figure out what to do with it. And I can’t group or organize on the webpage at all. A really terrible experience. And hasn’t improved in years. Amazon has done nothing for the core Kindle market, people that actually read a lot of books.</p>

<p>Annoyed. Wasting my time, Amazon.</p>

<p>Look at the first half of this schedule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aug. 30 - vs. Navy (at Baltimore’s M&amp;T Bank Stadium)</li>
  <li>Sept. 13 - Kent State</li>
  <li>Sept. 20 - Virginia Tech</li>
  <li>Sept. 27 - Cincinnati</li>
  <li>Oct. 4 - at Maryland</li>
  <li>Oct. 18 - Rutgers</li>
  <li>Oct. 25 - at Penn State</li>
</ul>

<p>You’d not be able to tell this team was in the Big10 based on this. The center of mass of this schedule is somewhere like Hagerstown, Maryland.</p>

    <p>So I’ve been acquiring and playing with 50-100 year old electrical lab instruments.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/freqmeter.jpg"><img src="images/freqmeter-300x225.jpg" alt="freqmeter" /></a>My latest is a <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_2/chpt_12/2.html">reed-type frequency meter</a>, I didn’t even know these things existed. Great admiration for the people who originally designed these things, a very clever little design. We tried a brief experiment to get it running today, but no response. We may not have been applying enough voltage, the wires in these things could probably handle 50+ amps.</p>

<p>I’ve also got this potentiometer<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/potentiometer.jpg"><img src="images/potentiometer-300x215.jpg" alt="potentiometer" /></a>, utterly crazy looking, and with controls and labels that are a mystery to me – terminals labeled E+ and E-, H and H1, L and L1, BA+, R, and a couple others. A big wonking selector switch that looks like it could transmit 50 amps, and a fine tuning gauge. I’ll be putting an ohmmeter on this thing to see what the hell is going on.</p>

<p>I’ve also got some more awesome potentiometers and voltmeters. As well as a variable capacitor. These things were built for the ages – massive wires, plenty of ventilation, solid wood and metal and bakelite construction. They are all amazingly beautiful.</p>

<p>I’m working to bond an arduino to some of these so I can use them for more mundane modern purposes. But they look great just sitting on the shelf.</p>

A family is shattered by a school fire, and the critically injured mother battles to protect her kids and uncover the truth around the events. Great story about the relationship between a woman and her family, tested by extreme events. The voice used in the story is a little confusing at times – I read the Kindle version, I wonder if the printed version used typography to better set apart the actions and thoughts of various characters.</li>

Great detective tale featuring an abrasive self-destructive sleuth. I should read more in the series.</li>

Another great detective character and story. In both this tale and the Rankin, the leads care about justice and to hell with the rules. But they go about it totally different ways. The Rankin character is a blunt rusty knife, the Zouroudi character is a judo master. Fun stuff.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Beautiful-Forevers-Mumbai-Undercity/dp/1400067553/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367178907&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=behind+the+beautiful+forevers">Behind the Beautiful Forevers</a> by Katherine Boo.

Well written and pretty crisp, a nice coverage of what the phrase “the rule of law” means, its history, and implications for today. Worthwhile.</li>

A rocking show – just his current small backing band of 3 women on drums, bass, and guitar. Opened with a few classics, including a nice variant on “I Could Never Take The Place of Your Man”. A lot of his new material. A nice cover of the Cars’ “Let’s Go” with a shout out to Boston. A really nice cover of “Crimson and Clover”. Along the way Prince was in great lead guitar form, and also picked up the bass at one point for a great solo.</p>

<p>He is a captivating performer. I’ve seen Jack White in a small venue and Buddy Guy, they both pour a lot of emotion into their guitar work, Prince is up there as well.</p>

But maybe I can get used to it.</p>

<p>But moving beyond that, I just want to use a damn printer. There is nothing about printers on the home screen. When you type in “printers” it says it can’t find anything. Awesome. So I bring up the stupid f&amp;*king charms (because menus and ribbons and taskbars weren’t good enough ways to start programs, let’s invent a whole new system, yay), choose Settings, choose “Change PC Settings”. Oh there is nothing called “printers” in this list either. OK click on devices and you can add a device, and then it tries and tries to search for devices. Meanwhile it is showing me a crappy list of devices I do have – great I have a “HL_DT_ST BD-RE WH08LS20” installed, that is good to know. Oh and I have devices called “Microsoft XPS Document Writer” and “Send To OneNote 2013”. Where are those on my desk? Those are so much more important to me than my damn printer.</p>

<p>I know it isn’t cool and strategic to print anymore. But people still need to f&amp;*king print. I eventually found a way to add a printer but don’t ask me where the hell I found it.</p>

<p>Oh and the arduino software won’t install on it, apparently the arduino board is not trusted. To install it, you have to boot into the secret system setup mode which you get to deep in the control panel, and choose to turn off driver signing enforcement. Except this super secret startup mode hangs on my brand new machine and I have to power cycle. That is great, you certainly don’t want the most active community of tinkerers using your operating system.</p>

<p>Oh and I am using with dual monitors – one plain old monitor and one touchscreen. DON’T DO THIS. It sounded like a great idea, keep the new interface off in one screen in its little ghetto, and run all my real apps on the other screen. Except the touch interface is horribly confused now – a touch on my touch screen moves the pointer on my non-touch screen.</p>

<p>Yes I am doing perhaps somewhat niche-y things but Windows used to be good at that, damn it. It would run on anything and let you do anything. Now it is just an OSX/iOS wannabe and not very good at that.</p>

<p>Not in a good mood.</p>
