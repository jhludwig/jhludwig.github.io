The stories behind some of the most unusual and unlikely places on the globe – places belonging to no nation, to many nations, floating, underground, in the sky – and an understanding of the meaning and importance of place.  Enjoyable.  </li>

Great suspenseful adventure in a world filled with magic –  kind of a grown-up Harry Potter milieu.  The first page grabs you – the protagonist awakens with no memory, in a park surrounded by bodies, and in her pocket is a note that says “Read Me”. Stiletto isn’t quite as strong but still a fund read.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dispatches-Pluto-Found-Mississippi-Delta-ebook/dp/B00UDCNM82">Dispatches From Pluto</a> by Richard Grant. An English adventure writer decides to settle in the Mississippi Delta. Interesting look at the culture and issues of a part of the country that seems almost foreign to me.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Stars-Peter-Heller-ebook/dp/B007GZELF2">The Dog Stars</a> by Peter Heller. A different kind of post-apocalyptic novel, the world has largely been emptied out, a very few people try to find their way and remain human.  </li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Season-Broken-Earth/dp/0316229296">The Fifth Season</a> by N. K. Jemison. A small set of related characters finding their way on a far-future(?) Earth peopled by humans and human derivatives, littered with the artifacts of past civilizations, undergoing yet another seismic/volcanic reshaping. Of course there is some conspiracy at work. Good tale, characters dealing with painful issues.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/06/recent-books-29/connectography/"><img src="images/connectography.jpg" alt="connectography" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Connectography-Mapping-Future-Global-Civilization/dp/0812988558">Connectography</a> by Parag Khanna. How the world is moving beyond nation-states to clusters driven by interconnectivity. Well written and a lot of maps, and I am a sucker for maps.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruins-Gorlan-Rangers-Apprentice-Book/dp/0142406635">The Ruins of Gorlan</a> by John A. Flanagan. Pretty standard YA fantasy, but fun nevertheless. I’d read more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Call-Novel-Yannick-Murphy-ebook/dp/B004MMEIVE">The Call</a> by Yannick Murphy. Eh, what started out as a clever structural gadget became tiring. I am a little curious to know what happens to the family but I gave up.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-After-Novel-Kate-Atkinson-ebook/dp/B008TUQ60G">Life After Life</a> by Kate Atkinson. I like Atkinson, but this book also became tiresome, tho I managed to finish. But I’d recommend a different Atkinson.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farthing-Small-Change-Jo-Walton-ebook/dp/B002LA0ANO">Farthing</a> by Jo Walton. How did I miss this? Conspiracy, murder in the English countryside in an alternative history where Britain made peace with the Nazis. Excellent.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Those-Who-Wish-Me-Dead-ebook/dp/B00FPQA76Q">Those Who Wish Me Dead</a> by Michael Koryta. A boy witnesses a murder, and, well, shit happens. Fun but not memorable.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Little-Lies-Liane-Moriarty-ebook/dp/B00HDMMISA">Big Little Lies</a> by Liane Moriarty. Completely fun story of conflicts between parents at a preschool, hilarious but serious. Apparently coming to HBO, this will be fun</li>

Fantastic story of a misanthropic obsessive genius and how he impacted family and friends around him. An incredibly unlikeable and yet sympathetic main character. Very good.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Day-Ellie-McEnroe-Novel-ebook/dp/B00RKQ657E">Dragon Day</a> by Lisa Brackmann. Solid detective tale set in modern day China, where it seems everyone is out for their own advantage, and justice is a hard thing to find.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Souls-Nights-Masque-ebook/dp/B005411EL4">The Alchemist of Souls</a> by Anne Lyle. Fantasy set in the early days of the New World exploration, with a New World quite different than ours, peopled by a non-human race. Entertaining, not sure I am driven to keep up with the series tho.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Birds-Charlie-Jane-Anders-ebook/dp/B00W190RPG">All the Birds in the Sky</a> by Charlie Jane Anders. It’s the end of the world, maybe, and two childhood friends come together to save it, one with a deep science background, one with a deep mystical background. Good characters but I felt it kind of dissolved into mystical goo.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chimera-Parasitology-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B00X47ZY9S">Chimera</a> by Mira Grant. The last in a 3 book series about semi-intelligent and autonomous tapeworms invading human beings. OK it was fun at times but probably 1 book too long.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Victoria-Vanishes-Peculiar-Crimes-Mystery-ebook/dp/B0013TPXD6">The Victoria Vanishes</a> by Christopher Fowler. Fun tale of two aging detectives investigating a very very strange set of murders. I’ve read another in series, solid characters.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Planetfall-Emma-Newman/dp/0425282392">Planetfall</a> by Emma Newman. Ok this started out slow, a group of colonists on a new planet, but it went very strange, with a strange alien experience, and twisted humans.</li>

				<p><p>My last batch of books were very good, and so my bar is raised. I couldn’t get through either of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Witch-Lime-Street-Seduction-Houdini/dp/0307451062">The Witch of Lime Street</a>” by David Jaher. This gets great reviews, but is incredibly choppy, and the characters are unappealing, or to be precise, the author does a poor job of introducing them in appealing fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Master-Algorithm-Ultimate-Learning-Machine/dp/0465065708">The Master Algorithm</a> by Pedro Domingos. This falls into the classic trap that many books of this type fall into – in its attempt to make a technical topic more interesting to a broader audience, it dumbs down its treatment of the topic, and is simplistic and repetitive. And so pushes away readers who have more background. It is obviously hard to achieve the right balance, I could not stay with this book.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phishing-Phools-Economics-Manipulation-Deception/dp/0691168318">Phishing for Phools</a> by George Akerlof and Robert Shiller. OK I have great empathy for the material, an expose of how we are manipulated and deceived (and how we buy into this).

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Mercy-Imperial-Radch-Leckie/dp/0316246689">Ancillary Mercy</a> by Ann Leckie. Third in the series and it is still holding up. Fascinating far future tale of empire and intrigue with a very unique set of ideas about identity.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Verificationist-Novel-Donald-Antrim/dp/0312662149">The Verificationist</a> by Donald Antrim. Very well written, the self-absorbed main character is having a breakdown or trip, and you are along for the ride.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moxyland-Lauren-Beukes-ebook/dp/B01922I24M">Moxyland</a> by Lauren Beukes. Eh, near future spread of technology through the less developed world. Some nice ideas but ultimately bored me.</li>

  <p>We eat pancakes to escape loneliness, yet within moments we want nothing more than our freedom from ever having so<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2015/12/we-promise-ourselves-that-we-will-know-better-next-time-than-to-order-pancakes-in-any-size-or-in-any-amount/veri/"><img src="images/veri.jpeg" alt="veri" /></a> much as thought about pancakes. Nothing can prevent us, after eating pancakes, from feeling the most awful regret. After eating pancakes, our great mission in life becomes the repudiation of the pancakes and everything served along with them, the bacon and the syrup and the sausage and coffee and jellies and jams. But these things are beneath mention, compared with the pancakes themselves. It is the pancake—Pancakes! Pancakes!—that we never learn to respect. We promise ourselves that we will know better, next time, than to order pancakes in any size or in any amount. Never again will we be tempted by buckwheat or buttermilk or blueberry flapjacks. However, we fail to learn; and the days go by, two or three weeks pass, then a month, and we forget about pancakes and their dominion over us. Eventually, we need them. We crawl back to pancakes again and again.</p>
