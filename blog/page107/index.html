				<p><p>Hate the feel of softened water. Didn’t really understand the chemistry of water softening until I poked around a little tonight – <a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/question99.htm">how does a water softener work</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_softener">wikipedia topic</a> – apparently water softeners replace the Ca and Mg ions with Na which is less damaging to pipes, etc. But it still makes the water feel slippery. I’d like something that removes the Ca and Mg and leaves nothing behind. A lot of systems claim to do this, some below:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.lifesourcewater.com/physical_conditioning.html" title="Water Softener - Water Filter - Water Softners">Water Softener - Water Filter - Water Softners</a> * <a href="http://www.advancedwaterfilters.com/">Advanced Water Filters</a> * <a href="http://clearwatergmx.com/">GMX</a> -- this looks way too low capacity * The <a href="http://www.aquaferwater.com/AWS12.html">Aquafer</a> * The <a href="http://www.scaleblaster.com/">ScaleBlaster</a>. Also probably too low capacity but I love the name.</p>

<p>I wonder if any of these work. And are cost effective.</p>

				<p><p>Please please please – pretend you are a student and go out and attend a week’s worth of college visits at other institutions. I think you will find that there is a lot of mind numbing repetition across the presentations and tours. You all have study abroad programs, intern programs, food service, blue light security on campus, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>What is far more interesting to hear about is the unique aspects of your institution and the community you are in. And maybe a direct compare/contrast between your institution and your most direct “competitors”. And consider doing something different in your presentation than every other college; one school brought in a professor to talk with the kids, this was memorable; another school gave away ice cream sandwiches at the end of the tour, a simple gesture but the kids loved it.</p>

<p>I’d consider running two different info sessions and tours – one for first time college visitors, and one for people who have seen 2 or more schools already.</p>

<p>I guess what I’m saying is think a little more deeply about your audience and what they are going thru, and tune the presentation to them.</p>

				<p><p>* “Sunstroke”:amazon by Jesse Kellerman. Great story of a woman searching in northern Mexico for the truth about her missing boss. Great protagonist. Great supporting cast – I love the stonecutter. Very atmospheric. * “A Wicked Snow”:amazon by Gregg Olsen. Really choppy. Not a terrible story but uncomfortable to read. Where was the editor? Great cover blurb by lee child but I can’t fully recommend. * “Mission Flats”:amazon by William Landay. Police mystery set in Boston and Maine. A smalltime Maine chief of police gets involved over his head in a Boston murder conspiracy. Nice twisted ending tho I did anticipate it a little. * “Without Fail”:amazon by Lee Child. Reacher seems a little more fallible in this tale. Misses obvious clues early and often. And the bad guys show up way too late in the book, bad form for a mystery. So not the best reacher but still entertaining. * “Blue Light”:amazon by Walter Mosley. Twisty tale of alien consciousness, drugs, psychosis. Hard to tell what really happened and what was imagined. I found myself liking the characters more than I expected. * “Killing Floot”:amazon by Lee Child. Another slam bang jack reacher tale. Reacher rips the covers off a southern town conspiracy leaving a wake of bodies behind. Don’t screw with reacher. This series continues to be the best airplane books. * “From Fatigued to Fantastic!”:amazon by Teitelbaum. Good overview of chronic fatigue and potential causes and treatments. Not a cookbook, more of a collection of all the ideas around fatigue.</p>
