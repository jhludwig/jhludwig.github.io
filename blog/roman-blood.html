	<title>Recent Books -- Roman Blood, Master and Margarita, Moonbound, On Desperate Ground, Finding Dorothy, Advanced Portfolio Management, Steel Fear, Seven Blades in Black, A Half-built Garden, The Holocaust: An Unfinished History – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="
  Roman Blood by Steven Saylor.  A historical mystery set in ancient Rome.  Quite the page turner.  Apparently a lot of true history in here.
  The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov.  Very well regarded, but I may not be Russian enough, and I do not like farce.   Hard to get into.
  Moonbound by Robin Sloan.  There are a few books that let you peek into a vast strange world and have a fun adventure, and hint at much much more.  The Hobbit was one of those books for me.  This is another.  A fascinating world, a classic hero’s tale, just a lot of fun.
  On Desperate Ground by Hampton Sides.  The story of the Chosin Reservoir campaign in the Korean War.  A brutal story, a brutal war.  War sucks, and hubris and incompetence make it suck more.
  Finding Dorothy by Elizabeth Letts.  I am on the fence here.   I did finish the book, but I never really felt like I found Dorothy.  There is a story in here somewhere about how Dorothy is a representation of the women in Baum’s life, but it never quite clicked for me.
  Advanced Portfolio Management: A Quant’s Guide for Fundamental Investors by Giuseppe Paleologo.  Solid and short explanation of the mathematical basics of portfolio management.  The math is not intimidating at all, a good read.
  Steel Fear by Brandon Webb and John David Mann.  Super fun thriller, reminds me a little of the Alistair MacLean books I loved as a kid, only more modern and better depth.
  Seven Blades in Black by Sam Sykes.  So I enjoyed this as escapist fare, but it is annoying that every chapter seems to feature an even more fearsome enemy, and the hero discovers a power every chapter that just happens to top that enemy.
  A Half-Built Garden by Ruthanna Emrys.  An interesting exploration of a eco friendly future, but WAAAAY too long.  Too much description, not enough story.
  The Holocaust: An Unfinished History by Dan Stone.  Not a happy book at all!  A re-examination of the Holocaust, how widespread the perpetrators were, and how it there are still echoes in our societies today.
