	<title>Recent Books -- The Body Keeps the Score, Unbearable Lightness, Fingerpost, Random Acts of Medicine, Imagine a City – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>

  The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel van der Kolk.  Fascinating book on the effects of trauma and how to work with trauma.  I did not realize how ineffective talk therapy and pharmaceuticals were, and how important other types of therapy involving movement, acting, etc could be.
  The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera.  I wanted to like this, a number of friends like it, and with the author’s passing, it seemed like the time to try it.  I am sure it is my failing that I couldn’t get into it.  Characters are weird and unrelatable.
  An Instance of the Fingerpost by Iain Pears.  I should love this book? I mean I like mysteries and I like clever structures and I like unreliable narrators.  But I just couldn’t ever care about the story or the characters.
  Random Acts of Medicine by Anupam B. Jena, Christopher Worsham.  The authors want to write the “Freakonomics” of medicine but too much exposition and not enough data.
  Imagine a City: A Pilot’s Journey Across the Urban World by Mark Vanhoenacker.  Interesting wander through many of the major cities of the globe, and through the author’s life as he traversed them. I have this image of airplane pilots as being very engineerish, but this author is very poetic and thoughtful.
