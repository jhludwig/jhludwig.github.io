				<p><p>* “Cities in the Wilderness : A New Vision of Land Use in America”:amazon by former interior secretary Bruce Babbitt. I alternate between hate and love for this book. Love the goals of better protecting and restoring our natural landscapes. Bruce is clearly smart and experienced. Hate the general bias towards big expensive governmental mechanisms. Love his willingness to repurpose existing agricultural entitlements to achieve his goals – seems pragmatic and efficient. Again tho hate the general bias towards massive government. I’d argue that the best government is a a very light, deft touch, with great leverage of the marketplace – for instance the Federal Reserve and its management of the economy. Sure wish smart policy thinkers would come up with an analog for managing our natural resources. Whatever, an interesting read by a smart guy. * “Tell No One”:amazon byt Harlan Coben. My second by Harlan, what a great twisty thriller. This guy can engage you. Stud. * “The Turn Of The Screw”:amazon by Henry James. Did I review this before? Good little horror tale. Never quite clear who is seeing what, what is real, what is imagined. Fairly stilted language but still does the job. * “Martian Time-Slip”:amazon by Philip K. Dick. Doesn’t age well. You are going to be more intrigued reading Bradbury (ages well) or reading more current authors. * “Cell”:amazon by Stephen King. Not up to the best of his “classic” period (It, Pet sematary,…). But a good modern scare. * “Life with Jeeves”:amazon by P. G. Wodehouse. Delightful. Plots for a dozen light romances in here. A joining of 3 books – a little long. But in small doses, marvelous. This would be a great book to leave sitting in a cabin – great for idle reading.</p>

<p>Until the adults involved in college sports (the networks, schools, the ncaa, the sponsors) quit stuffing their own pockets and start sharing the revenues equitably with the people creating the value, leakages like this will happen.</p>

				<p><p>OK I have no idea if this is the best of Yakima but it is what I found in 4 days there:</p>

<p>* Where to stay – we stayed in the Hojo’s, it was merely adequate. Locals tell me that the Red Lion and the new Marriott Courtyard are nicer * Dining – <a href="http://www.zestacucina.com/menu/index.html">Zesta Cucina</a> was great! The find of the trip. Great atmosphere, and they handled our huge group (45+) well. We also dined at the <a href="http://www.olivegarden.com">Olive Garden</a> – it was yet another Olive Garden – and at Tequila’s – standard chain Mexican but in converted railroad cars downtown so kind of fun. Both the Garden and Tequila’s also did a good job with our mob. In all cases, do the restaurant a favor – have one person pay and figure out how to break it up later. * Lunch – El Grullense (near the Sundome) is a fine little taqueria. And Miner’s (also near the dome) is classic burger drive-in fare. * Recreation – well of course if you are there for a high school state tournament or a state fair then you will spend a lot of time at the <a href="http://www.fairfun.com/sundome/">Sundome</a>. Note that they have some fairly restrictive rules about fan behaviour for high school events so you might want to dig into it before you go - signs, bodypainting, too much standing, boomboxes – all prohibited. As is outside food of any sort. * Other recreation – the riverwalk along the Naches and Yakima rivers is a pleasant walk. And you can get into the Cascades to the west in a half hour for hiking etc. The <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/wenatchee/forest/formain.htm">Naches Ranger Station on Route 12</a> is a great place to stop and get current condition info, maps, etc. Based on my experience - bring snowshoes if you are heading out in early march, because there aren’t many trails clear yet.</p>

				<p><p>To match my new sli pc, i updated to gaming-optimized input devices – the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2142,CONTENTID=10715">g5 mouse</a> and <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2166,CONTENTID=10717">g15 keyboard</a>. The keyboard is cool – the little lcd display during games is very cool. I’ve seen this keyboard in action for months and finally had to get one. The mouse is also cool – the adjustable weights are awesome – i am running in the heaviest config right now but will see where i end up.</p>

<p>One huge beef tho – the lack of certified drivers. Not that I am anal about certification, it is just that install is a PITA as you have to wade thru a sea of warnings from MSFT that these drivers will make your PC break out in hives. Logitech is a big company, MSFT is a big company, why can’t they get their heads together and get this solved?</p>

<p>A very smart colleague at <a href="http://www.bah.com">Booz-Allen</a> gave me two simple rules to help me in guiding my career:</p>

<p>* <strong>Work on a business that is critical to the enterprise in which you work</strong>. Read the annual report of your company – does it talk about your business a lot, does it care about your business, does your business contribute a substantial profit to the enterprise? If so, the company will invest in and protect the business, and you will personally get support and challenges. If on the other hand the company doesn’t really care about your business – then you will be under-resourced, under-supported, and you may very well find your business shut down or sold some day. * <strong>You can either make things, or sell things</strong>. These are the two sources of enduring value in a business. And I am using a broad definition of “make” – i mean you have to be involved in creating the core value of the business – whether that be making products or providing a service. These are the functions that have to happen no matter what in a business. Every other function is subject to the vagaries of internal politics, bureaucracy, cost-cutting pressures, and other unpredictable forces – and thus is it hard to control your career path.</p>

<p>Following these rules always presented me with opportunities, challenges, responsibilities, and chances for career mobility. A whole separate discussion can be had about whether you want an aggressively upwardly mobile career-building job at all points in your life – you probably don’t – but if you do, these are reasonable simple guidelines.</p>
