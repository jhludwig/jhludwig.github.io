    <p>I upgraded my server today to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx" title="Windows Server 2003 Home">Windows Server 2003</a>. Kind of rocky so far, a lot of events thrown during setup and on reboot, and some troubles getting some services to run. still, http server seems to be alive, tho i can’t access the net as a client. Probably should have read the “planning guide” and actually thought about things before I just rammed it on the system. Forgive any rockiness the next couple of weeks as I get things worked out.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/05/26/aftermarket-car-audio.html">Aftermarket Car Audio</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve never purchased any aftermarket car audio products but I am getting really interested in solutions that would let me listen to my entire ripped cd collection in the car. I picked up <a href="http://www.caraudiomag.com/">CarAudio</a> magazine this week to start to understand the market. <a href="http://www.phatnoise.com/products/digitalmediaplayers/index.php" title="The PhatBox">The PhatBox</a> is one cool product for transporting 20G of music out to the car. The <a href="http://www.kenwoodusa.com/product/product.jsp?productId=2373">Kenwood Music Keg</a> looks like the other generally available solution. The <a href="http://www.omnifimedia.com/products/omnifi_details.jsp?productId=12541">OmniFi</a> from Rockford is another choice, it seems to have some wifi link so that maybe you don’t have to actually physically connect the hard disk in the car to your PC.</p>

<p>Now what I really want tho is just something that will connect my ipod to my car, both charging it and routing the audio out into the car stereo. I don’t need yet another 20gig hard disk with my songs on it, the ipod is just fine. And i am happy to use the ipod UI to tune things in. There are some solutions for hooking up ipods to your car system (for example see <a href="http://www.ipodlounge.com/gearguide.php">this one</a>) but they all seem to use FM as the transport into the car stereo, I want something that connects up with wires for a higher fidelity experience.</p>

<p>It’d be nice if my car just had an aux/rca input jack so i could play any audio content thru the car speakers and amp.</p>

We had three police cars in our driveway this morning, after 3-4 young people celebrating a 21st birthday got out of hand, broke into the boat locker in the park next door, stole a canoe, landed at our dock, and wandered thru our yard to the street at 6:45am. Unfortunately they parked their car at the park, and were nicely caught on a security camera, so they spent the remainder of the day in jail.</p>

    <p>I bought <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/links2003/home/default_2.asp" title="Links 2003">Links 2003</a> and installed recently, wanted to see what state of the art in golf games was. This can’t be it. Buggy as crap – hard to finish a round without a crash. And compared to a modern 3d accelerated game (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament, etc), this is such a slow game. It renders a static background, a player moving, and a little white ball flying thru the air – a pathetic amount of motion and detail compared to one of these other games. And yet it takes Links sometimes as much as a minute to render the next scene. What is it doing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gamers.com/game/1254815">Tiger Woods 2003</a> is reputedly a better game.</p>
