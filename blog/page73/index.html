  <h1><a href="/2006/08/23/sounddogs-2.html">SoundDogs</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve been working on my halloween soundtracks and I needed some new thunder sounds. I’ve been using some thunder tracks off of old sfx cds but they have a lot of ambient hiss – sometimes by design to sound like rain, sometimes just crappy recorded. When you amp up these tracks for outdoor usage, the hiss is just too much.</p>

<p>I wanted some clean thunder tracks and so went to <a href="http://www.sounddogs.com/" title="Sound Effects, Production Music, Royalty Free Music, MP3 AIF WAV Sound Effects">Sound Effects, Production Music, Royalty Free Music, MP3 AIF WAV Sound Effects</a>. Great experience – they have more choices than you can possibly imagine, and they deliver in just about any encoding form you could want. And to reward me, they sent me a free sfx after I ordered – pretty smart, the marginal cost of them doing this is basically nothing and they have made me happy. Recommended.</p>

    <p>Prior to MT3.3, I was using a plugin to automagically convert keywords into categories, and basically using keywords as tags. now I am trying to switch to the mt3.3 official tags feature, but i’d still like the feature that autoconverts tags into categories. i just want one set of descriptive words which gives me the features of tags and categories. is there a plugin that keeps tags and categories in sync?</p>

<p>A question I have tho is how to manage all this content. I am going to end up with a lot of imaged documents. I wonder if all the free photo management apps like Picasa can handle pdfs? i’d love to have all the photo management features – tagging, timeline view, etc.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2006/08/14/recent-books-and-stuff-i-should-read.html">Recent books -- and stuff I should read</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “Beyond Oil”:amazon by Deffeyes. Excellent, breezy book looking at the production and supply issues behind oil and all other energy sources, by a very smart scientist. An essential read if you care about energy policy. It is difficult not to be an advocate of nuclear power after reading this. * “Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World”:amazon by Weatherford. A reasonably engaging history of genghis khan and the mongol empire. Sadly neglected in the history I was taught. One wonders how the world might have turned if just a few events had gone differently – the spread of the plague, the japanese invasion, the indonesian invasion. * “The Ruins”:amazon by Scott Smith. Stephen king-esque. A little slow to start but finishes with a bang. Tho I never really cared about the characters.</p>

<p>Oh and stuff I should be reading – <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/08/phd_macro_readi.html">Marginal Revolution’s recommended reading list for PhD Macroeconomics</a>.</p>

    <p>As i previously mentioned, my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/07/switching_my_gaming_pc.html">widowpc gaming computer has been acting up</a> – it has always had thermal issues, and their support has been weak. I finally ripped open the box and figured out exactly how the liquid cooling system worked, forced some bubbles out of the system and probably broke up some vapor lock in the pump. WidowPC shipped no doc with the system and their support staff doesn’t really know what it is in my box, so I can’t recommend them highly.</p>

<p>I was hoping <a href="http://www.alienware.com/" title="Alienware: High-Performance Systems - Notebooks, Desktop PCs, Workstations, Peripherals">Alienware: High-Performance Systems - Notebooks, Desktop PCs, Workstations, Peripherals</a> would be better, given their Dell ownership and longer tenure in the market. My new alienware arrived yesterday and ominously, the shipping box had a big gash in it – the shipping materials were very flimsy. The front of the case was marred in several spots and when I turned the unit on, it sounded like an Oster Blender. Not Good.</p>

<p>I took a bunch of pictures of the shipping box and the PC and emailed them to Alienware last night. Response email this morning directed me to call in. So call I did. I had to walk three different people (none of them native English speakers) through problem and all the pictures. The last guy wanted me to open the case and figure out exactly what component was grinding itself into bits. This was 45 minutes into the call, I refused. I paid top dollar for a machine that was broken out of the box, and I paid for 3 years of onsite support – I didn’t realize I was the onsite support. He backed down and agreed to take the machine back, it took more than an hour to finally get receive an RMA and Fedex label – nearly two hours total. Everyone was nice but this is crazy, way too much time. So I can’t say I am thrilled with Alienware so far.</p>

<p>I bounce back and forth between building my own machines/providing my own frontline support, and buying retail and demanding retail support. My time is constrained right now and so I fired myself as an assembly/support person and have gone back to retail. But this is no fun.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2006/08/07/halloween-sound-creation.html">Halloween Sound Creation</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>This halloween I want to put a little more effort into some of my sound tracks. I’ve generally been using just selected tracks from various SFX CDs, all burned to mix CDs that I play at various locations.</p>

<p>This year I want to invest a little more in crafting some sounds. First, i really like Pimpf from <a href="http://www.lala.com/frontend/action/albumdetails?id=72339069014735081">Depeche Mode’s Music for the Masses</a> as a basic graveyard tune. I’m using <a href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/showproduct.asp?pid=971">Sony ACID Music Studio</a> to add some reverb and phasing to the music to increase it’s general creepiness. And then mixing in some wind and some howling wolves. Sounds great, this is my first time diving into mixing and track editing and I have to say the Sony software is pretty approachable.</p>

<p>I will probably upgrade to <a href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/showproduct.asp?pid=1005" title="Sony Media Software - ACID Pro 6">Sony Media Software - ACID Pro 6</a> as I next want to create some sounds that will pan across my courtyard – a moaning ghost for instance.</p>

<p>Update: Mixing a lot of sounds tonight. The most reliably creepy effect is to mix together two copies of the same exact track, one shifted up a half note. Turns even the most pleasant tune into a creepy mess.</p>
