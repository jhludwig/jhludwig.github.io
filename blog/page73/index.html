I don’t mind the snarky humour but the pedantic nature of some sections gets old – it is as if it is not enough that the reader open his mind to the writer’s ideas, but that the reader must accept them fully and displace all others.

				<p><p>A solid opening for the season, though just reinforced that we should never ever schedule FCS opponents, there is just no upside. My pregame pick was 44-0 so not feeling too bad.</p>

<p>* At the QB position, Boeckman looked efficient tho at times continues to underthrow the receiver – are the coaches really encouraging him to do this? Against tougher opponents this just seems dumb. Pryor looked great on runs and short passes – he can zip the ball. Not there yet on longer passes and at times made poor decisions to run under pressure. But clearly a talent. * Beanie, beanie, beanie. Honestly, why was he still playing at the time of his injury? The highest paid coach in the Big 10 should have had him out once he hit 100 yards. Hopefully it is just a sprain. The backup running backs played well. * Nice to see a shutout, nothing else would have served against this opponent * Nice to see some kicking practice</p>

<p>Upwards and onwards.</p>
