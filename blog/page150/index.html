By the way you have to love Apple’s iPod support policy – my iPod Photo was acting flakey, they gave me a new one, no questions asked. * <a href="http://www.mckelvie.org/">Sam</a> loves <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/688/slim_devices_rocks">the new slimp3 player</a> (nice blog sam). * <a href="http://www.netstumbler.com/2004/12/17/turnable_surfaces_prevent_wi_fi_leaks/">Tunable glass windows to block selective radio transmissions</a> – because I know everyone is trying to steal our secrets. * <a href="http://estone-tech.com/">Car stereo with removable HD</a> – way easier to use than an ipod in the car * And <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,108697,00.asp">a wifi access point in my car</a> – hmm, once i have full ip in the car, it sure seems like all these proprietary car nav systems with dated map discs will get crushed by mapquest/googlemaps/etc</p>

				<p><p>OK in the last four days Comcast has cut my IP address lease times down to 2 hours. At at the end of that two hours there are often 3-5 minutes when I cannot get a valid lease at all.</p>

<p>Spoke with comcast and got the run around – “reboot everything”, “remove your router”, “unplug your toaster”, “wear a little foil hat like joaquin phoenix did in Signs”. Finally they told me it is all the router’s fault (it’s been working fine for 1 year) and that I need to sign up for their home networking option.</p>

<p>So I am on hold to find out what that is. Anyone have any relevant advice?</p>

<p>UPDATE: spoke with a much better support person at Comcast. Issue has been escalated. I continue to see lease times &lt; 2 hours. And at every renewal, i am getting widely varying IP addresses (not so unusual) AND varying subnet masks – anything from 255.255.255.0 up to 255.255.255.250. that seems odd to me. I’ve switched routers to no avail, also tried routerless.</p>

				<p><p>I got a couple questions about <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001804.html">my post on LED lightbulbs</a>. While the LED bulbs are not ready for primetime, I have had good luck with <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/diy_main/pg_diy.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1268801727.1110222142@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=cceladdedellkfdcgelceffdfgidgln.0&amp;CNTTYPE=PROD_META&amp;CNTKEY=Super%20Categories/Home%20D%E9cor%20%26%20Organizing&amp;MID=9876&amp;pos=p04">these compact fluorescents from HDb</a>. They fit a standard socket and provide a very warm light, almost a little too yellow. But certainly no hint of blue.</p>

<p>I also recently ordered from http://www.lumitroncop.com and from http://www.1000bulbs.com. I ordered compact fluorescents to replace r20s and r30s (spots), we’ll see how those work.</p>

<p>I was motivated to move to incandescent alternatives because my office at home is too hot between all the PCs and devices and lights. Now that some have worked, I am motivated to move the whole house over for the energy savings. The one application that I am stuck with incandescents is for lights on dimming circuits – fluorescents don’t like variable voltage.</p>

				<p><p>I need a car for about 6 months to use up on Lopez Island. You can do long term rentals at places like <a href="http://www.budget.com/bbtm/">Budget</a> but very expensive.</p>

<p>Assuming an existing lease may be the way to go – <a href="http://www.swapalease.com/">Swapalease</a> and <a href="http://www.leasetrader.com/">Leasetrader</a> both seem to have a lot of inventory.</p>

<p>I wonder if contacting some local leasing agents directly might not be the smartest thing to do – they must have some leases in default that they need someone to pick up.</p>

<p>Not ready for primetime. Light is too directional, too blue, and not bright enough. But great for places like the garage where those problems aren’t an issue.</p>
