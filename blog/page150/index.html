				<p><p>Spent a couple nice days there this week. Great weather. Here are some essential links:</p>

<p>* Getting there. <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=ana-sj&amp;direction=west">WSDOT Ferry schedules</a> – read the footnotes carefully as there are a lot of intricacies in Lopez service. If you don’t need a car on the island, <a href="http://www.paracletecharters.com">Paraclete Charters</a> is a great way to go – avoid the ferry lines, and they can drop you anywhere, and they are nice people. * Staying. <a href="http://www.lopezfarmcottages.com/">Lopez Farm Cottages</a> are delightful – clean, completely invisible staff, lots of wild bunnies to entertain you. * Eating. The <a href="http://sanjuanislands.kulshan.com/Washington/San_Juan_County/Lopez_Island/Lopez_Village/Restaurants/Love_Dog_Cafe.htm">Love Dog Cafe</a> is great – we had a great halibut dinner, they do great pizzas, good crabcakes, pastas, etc. Holly ‘s Bakery is great for deserts and pastries. Isabel’s for your coffee fix. Vita’s for takeout sandwiches, food, and wine. All these are in the village, along with the grocery store. No shortage of calores in our two days there.</p>

				<p><p>After my forays this winter to <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001776.html">Duluth</a> and <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001832.html">el paso</a>, I wasn’t expecting much from the next stop in my tour of minor american cities – prescott, arizona.</p>

<p>Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Prescott is a gem. High desert country – great climate. Pleasantly treelined streets. Historical downtown which has largely been maintained. A little college influence. Lots of restaurants and arts for a small city. Biking, hiking trails abound. Great launch point for sidetrips to Sedona or Flagstaff.</p>

<p>I’d not be sad to go back.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK as anyone who has mucked around with fog machines knows, it is hard to get the fog to lie low. You can buy fog chillers or build your own, plans abound on the web.</p>

<p>But here is <a href="http://www.methodzofmadness.com/php/smf/index.php?topic=1391.new#new">a simple solution on the MOM forums</a> – basically run your fog machine output through a pile of mulch. Apparently the temperature and moistness of the mulch cool the fog enough to keep it down. Good idea, I will try this year.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">11 April 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>* El paso was dusty, hot, and windy. So brown compared to seattle. * Stayed at a decent hotel in downtown el paso – <a href="http://www.caminoreal.com/elpaso_i/index.html">the camino real</a>. An oasis of higher income activity in the downtown. * Downtown lively in day – every store rolls their wares out onto the street. But absolutely dead at night. And no one speaks English – I felt like a fish out of water. * You need to head out to the northern or eastern burbs for restaurants, shopping. I ate dinner at the <a href="http://www.guestlife.com/elpaso/dine/dinestate.html">State Line BBQ</a> – it was decent. Good potato salad. * <a href="http://www.utep.edu">UTEP</a> is on some hills overlooking the downtown. Banner year for men’s sports, both the bball and fball teams did well. The <a href="http://www.sunbowl.org/">Sun Bowl</a> is played here annually. * You can walk into Juarez for 35 cents. I spent Saturday morning wandering into Juarez. I was wondering “why do people visit Juarez?”. I wasn’t 25 feet across the border before I had my first Viagra offer. The main tourist street was lined with pharmacies. At 100 feet a cab driver offered to take me to a woman. * It took about 8-10 blocks of walking to punch thru this part of Juarez into the market area with more normal shops, bakeries, restaurants, etc. Much more pleasant.</p>

<p>Net/net, can’t say I’d ever want to come to a sun bowl.</p>

				<!-- <p><p>* El paso was dusty, hot, and windy. So brown compared to seattle. * Stayed at a decent hotel in downtown el paso – <a href="http://www.caminoreal.com/elpaso_i/index.html">the camino real</a>. An oasis of higher income activity in the downtown. * Downtown lively in day – every store rolls their wares out onto the street. But absolutely dead at night. And no one speaks English – I felt like a fish out of water. * You need to head out to the northern or eastern burbs for restaurants, shopping. I ate dinner at the <a href="http://www.guestlife.com/elpaso/dine/dinestate.html">State Line BBQ</a> – it was decent. Good potato salad. * <a href="http://www.utep.edu">UTEP</a> is on some hills overlooking the downtown. Banner year for men’s sports, both the bball and fball teams did well. The <a href="http://www.sunbowl.org/">Sun Bowl</a> is played here annually. * You can walk into Juarez for 35 cents. I spent Saturday morning wandering into Juarez. I was wondering “why do people visit Juarez?”. I wasn’t 25 feet across the border before I had my first Viagra offer. The main tourist street was lined with pharmacies. At 100 feet a cab driver offered to take me to a woman. * It took about 8-10 blocks of walking to punch thru this part of Juarez into the market area with more normal shops, bakeries, restaurants, etc. Much more pleasant.</p>

				<p><p>Reminded again this week how crappy the built-in ftp client in winxp is. Struggled for a day with uploading some simple cgis to a hosting service before it dawned on me that the xp client was sending them in binary mode, not ascii. I upload cgis to a windows server all the time using the xp client, apparently msft does something special between xp clients and windows servers to fix up the uploads because I never had a problem with this config.</p>

<p>And the builtin client doesn’t have a way to force ascii or binary, at least not that I could find.</p>

<p>“Filezilla”:google proved to be a great answer. Reasonable browsing ui, automatically handles ascii/binary selection for most files, handles disconnects/reconnects well.</p>

				<p><p>We love ipods so much that we have four in the house.</p>

<p>And itunes really sucks at handling this. we like to keep all our music on one server and this just creates a legion of problems. Getting itunes on all machines to take notice of new music on the server. Sharing playlists across the network. Ratings collision – we all have different ratings we want to maintain. And doing different loads of music onto each ipod.</p>

<p>Here’s how we manage the last item today – getting different subsets of our collection onto each ipod.</p>

<p>* We keep all our music in one huge directory, with subdirs per artist and album. Makes backup, searching, and all other operations easier. * In itunes I create partitioning playlists. Basically a playlist per user that represents the music they want on their ipod. In our case this is fairly easy as our interests break cleanly on genre lines, and it is easy in itunes to create playlists like “female vocal OR male vocal OR new age OR holiday”. * Then I configure our respective ipods (in the itunes app) to only pick up these playlists on synch.</p>

<p>As I said it is not perfect. Ratings collide. We have to avoid fights over genre tags. I have to do tag maintenance every once in a while. But it works ok for our household.</p>

<p>I am playing around with a different approach – using <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a> to fully replicate our music collection to a bunch of individual machines, and then letting people tag and rate their music as they want on that machine and sync on that machine. This creates a whole bunch of other problems, best solved if we only rip cds on one machine in the house (which is the case today), but it does work better in some ways with itunes.</p>

				<p><p>The web is an amazing thing. Saved us from a cooking disaster this weekend.</p>

<p>We hauled our rice cooker out of the small appliance graveyard in our house – wedged in between the juicer and bread machine, just in front of the waffle iron, on top of the paninni grill. Sadly tho, we had no manual for it. The cooker is like 10 years old, I figured we were hosed.</p>

<p>But hats off to Panasonic for <a href="http://service.us.panasonic.com/operman/">putting all their product manuals on the web</a>, even old ones.</p>
