    <p><strong>Sports Update</strong>. Overlake Gold soccer team tied Snohomish Country Christian 1-1 last night – and had way more shots on goal. Forest Ridge Varsity Volleyball team defeated Archbishop Murphy 3-1 last night and it could have been a lot worse, Forest Ridge was dominant. Wow, sports in a metropolitan private school league are draining – you get to drive all over the city between 3 and 7pm, the worst possible time to be on I-5 and I-405.</p>

    <p><strong>Forest Ridge Board meeting</strong>. We had a great board retreat last week. Some really great people on the board – Mike Russell at <a href="http://www.accenture.com">Accenture</a> and Walt Orlowski (formerly of MD and <a href="http://www.boeing.com">Boeing</a>) are great new additions to the board. I really enjoyed their articulation of the challenging market we face – every school is getting better, we have to improve just to keep our current enrollment – and of the need to have a strong quantative assessment of the market as the baseline for our planning. Really good vibe.</p>

    <p><strong>Floating Lantern</strong>. Got mine built and trialed yesterday – <a href="http://members.accesstoledo.com/kkrazykkaren/Floating/Lantern.html">Floating Lantern</a>. Very nice looking. I downsized a little and used a different lantern and lamp element but otherwise pretty much per these plans. I think i’d like a little higher rpm motor given the smaller diameter of the effect but it still looks good.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/09/13/college-apps.html">College Apps.</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>College Apps</strong>. Liz is making great progress on these. But a lot of work. I’ve been helping on the mechanics and the process. I’ve been exposed a lot to all the online application processes. A quick review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://www.commonapp.org/">Common App site</a> and forms get high marks. This is the application that 200+ private schools accept. High marks for posting edittable PDF forms so that you can type in the key data before giving to the school (for instance the school report form). Also high marks for having a form that can accomodate semesters or trimesters well.</li>
  <li>the Pomona app and Stanford app on <a href="http://www.embark.com">Embark</a> are reasonable. Reasonably clear forms.</li>
  <li>the Caltech app, Pepperdine, and UW apps are all on <a href="https://www.applyweb.com">applyweb</a> but don’t just go to the website, you need to route there through the college sites. Applyweb is a little more confusing than Embark in my estimation. Caltech doesn’t let you advance to later parts of the form until you have submitted the first part which is a downer. UW requires that you transcribe your complete transcript into a standard form on their app, this is a lot of work that is painful.</li>
  <li>U of California gets an incomplete so far. The online version for 2003 is not yet available. PDF forms are available for download. Like UW, you have to transcribe your transcript into their form – a lot of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>For all the apps you will need the Acrobat reader, a high speed connection, and a good laser printer (I recommend color). I also recommend the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/acrofamily/main.html">full Acrobat product</a> so you can overlay text on the forms, this allows you to complete the forms with a very professional look.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/09/12/extra-pcs.html">Extra PCs</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Extra PCs</strong>. I have 4 PCs in my house that see regular use. Because I keep upgrading these, I am starting to accumulate a pile of old PCs that are not really doing anything. I have 3 right now that are just rusting away. They don’t have enough storage by modern standards to store much. I’ve tried to use them as print servers but a) using windows nt server as just a print server is overkill and more management hassle than i want, and b) using linux as a print server with windows clients seems to be more of a config hassle than I have time to deal with. I need to find some other uses that require modest compute cycles, and for which I can find low-hassle maintenance-free software.</p>

    <p><strong>Ebizjets</strong>. One of my partners succumbed and is now an <a href="http://www.sentientjet.com/home.asp?from=ebizjets">ebizjets</a> member. Very interesting idea. I wonder if the prices will go down – today’s WSJ discussed a glut of business jets. Resale prices have certainly dropped. The claim in the article is that fractional rates won’t drop, implying that the economics were driven by operating costs (which haven’t dropped), not capital costs. I wonder tho.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/09/05/does-the-world-need-another-transport-protocol.html">Does the world need another transport protocol?</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>New Transport Protocols</strong>. We saw a company this week pitching a new protocol for a certain internet application. A protocol that is a replacement for a very widely used internet protocol today – something that is regularly emitted by most clients and regularly consumed by most servers.</p>

<p>We asked ourselves – does the world really need a new protocol? It is really hard to bring out a new protocol to displace an entrenched one. Tcpip was invented for low speed serial links with a lot of latency, and then was further tuned for 10mbit csma/cd ethernet, and was further tuned for today’s gigabit switched ethernet. It is not perfect for today’s low latency, low loss, switched fabrics. But it is good enough and so things like ISO died along the way. Heck we can’t even get to IPv6.</p>

<p>Even for fundamentally new media, like wireless (well kind of new, just ignore aloha for the sake of this argument), ip is probably going to win and overwhelm things like bluetooth.</p>

<p>The established base of economic activity around existing popular protocols is so great, it is hard for a new entrant to break in. Even if the new entrant is twice as fast, who cares? That is just 18 months of moore’s law.</p>

<p>So I am eternally doubtful about new protocols. A new protocol is going to have to be dramatically better – 10x plus – or solve a big problem that the existing protocol just can’t be bent to solve.</p>

<p>The cost to distribute a new protocol to hundreds of millions of end nodes and servers is just huge. Very very hard to get a new protocol distributed that is just a replacement for an existing one.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/09/04/travel-to-cleveland.html">Travel to cleveland</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Travel to Cleveland</strong>. Haven’t been on a redeye in years. I used to travel 4-5 days a week including redeyes, early mornings, middays, etc. My most extreme travel was maybe my 24 hoiur trip to paris for a dressing down by a client. I left cleveland and was back in 24 hours, and saw about 4 minutes of paris.</p>

<p>The newly remodelled northwest facility in dtw is great. Very spacious. A marked difference from my last trip here. I used to travel thru here weekly back when I was consulting for gm, standard tube of canada, ontario paper, and other midwest clients.</p>

<p>But of course my most memorable detroit airport moment was the night Liz was born. I was on a consulting assignment for standard tube of canada in woodstock ontario. A colleague and I were driving to detroit the night of november 19 to interview some automotive customers the following day. Between london and detroit we hit black ice and spun into the ditch, thankfully we were not hurt nor was the car damaged. We were towed out later and got to detroit around 2am. I spoke with C and all was fine, she was due in a week.</p>

<p>A half hour later the phone rang. C’s water had broken. She was heading for the hospital. I scrambled out of bed and got a cab to detroit city airport. Before leaving I called ahead to a charter operator and had them get a pilot out of bed. He met me at the airport and we left detroit in a little 4 seater and hopped across the lake to cleveland.</p>

<p>Getting a cab at 4am in cleveland was hard. After repeated calls with greater desparation on each call, the taxi dispatcher came out personally and took me to the hospital. I arrived a few minutes after 5 and at 529 Liz arrived. and she let the world know she was here, she was talking from the word go.</p>

    <p><strong>Dad</strong>. I just saw dad in the icu. He is doing great, they are moving him out of intensive care in the next hour. He looks good, is awake and lucid, and is anxious to get all the tubes out. Mom is doing great too.</p>

<p>The surgery was very successful. They were able to do a valve repair with a cosgrove ring and did not need to replace the valve which is great news. And they performed a maze procedure to correct his arhythmia as well. So very good news.</p>

<p>The cleveland clinic has quite an amazing heartcare facility. According to signs in the hall it is the number one rated heart facility in the country. There are a huge number of foreign patients coming and going here, they have translators on staff. My father’s doctor, dr cosgrove, invented the ring that was implanted in my father – the cosgrove ring. I certainly feel that we are in good hands here.</p>
