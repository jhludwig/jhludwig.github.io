<p>Motivated by <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/testing_wordpress_bluehost.php">Rich</a>, I am finally moving <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/" title="A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way">A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way</a> off my own server and onto a hosted service. Back when I started this thing, it was fun to have it on my own box and twiddle directly with the bits. But I am past that, and doing my own MT and OS upgrades has become tiresome.</p>

<p>I am trying out <a href="http://www.SiteGround.com">SiteGround</a> and <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">wordpress</a> as my new alternatives. Iâ€™ve duped all my content to a new shadow site, and am tweaking that. Seems to work OK, soon I will flip the domain to point to the new site.</p>
