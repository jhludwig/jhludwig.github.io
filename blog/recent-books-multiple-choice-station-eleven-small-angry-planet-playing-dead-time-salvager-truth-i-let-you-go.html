	<title>Recent Books -- Multiple Choice, Station Eleven, Small Angry Planet, Playing Dead, Time Salvager, Truth, I Let You Go – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="
  Multiple Choice by Alejandro Zambra. From the text – “You read books that are much stranger than the books you would write if you wrote.” – and that about sums it up. This is not for everyone, but I happen to like books that play with the structure of books. But don’t blame me if you buy it and say “WTF is this? Why would anyone read such a thing or write such a thing?”
  Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel. Solid post-apocalyptic novel with better characters than typical for the genre.
  The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers. A motley crew of space travelers slowly come to realize what family really means. Pleasant.
  Playing Dead: A Journal Through the World of Death Fraud by Elizabeth Greenwood. Don’t do it, the insurers will get you every time.
  Time Salvager by Wesley Chu. Eh, pretty forgettable space opera.
  The Truth and Other Lies by Sascha Arango. Nice little tale of psychopaths, murder, plots.
  I Let You Go by Clare Mackintosh. Twisty in a way I did not expect at all. Nice read.
