I’d say just an average science book. It didn’t really help me understand quantum computing components or algorithms that much. And also spent too much time on explaining classical computer terminology (explaining a NAND gate and its role as a universal constructor, explaining a Turing machine, explaining NP complete, explaining public key crypto, etc). In the author’s defense I’d guess this is a very hard book to write, I don’t think it is easy to explain quantum effects to those not deeply versed in the subject.</p>

Ford is in little better shape. They both seem like bankruptcy candidates soon, which means the pensioners will get screwed.

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>My cheapo <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000572.html">connectstor NAS box</a> died recently. Just started whirring and whirring, unresponsive to any remote CIFS or HTTP request. I tore it apart and mounted one of the raided 120G drives in a USB2.0 drive enclosure and started looking at it directly from my desktop machine.</p>

<p>First I tried <a href="http://www.powerquest.com/partitionmagic/">PartitionMagic</a> on it. Good news – the volume was recognizable. So-so news – it was an ext2 format volume, the connectstor box runs linux of course. PartitionMagic couldn’t seem to do much with ext2 volumes, I wanted to get the data off the disk.</p>

<p>Google suggests <a href="http://www.ext2fs.com/">Paragon Software’s Ext2FS</a> driver for windows. For $30 seemed worth trying, but their ecommerce site, hosted in europe somewhere, couldn’t seem to take my MasterCard. probably some little trivial problem but I didn’t have the patience to figure out.</p>

<p>Next I tried <a href="http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/explore2fs.htm" title="Explore2fs HomePage">Explore2fs</a>. Very nice windows utility, and I could see all my files, hurray! But trying to copy them out to my windows desktop hung the app. Some of the files made it but not all.</p>

<p>Next I found the <a href="http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/ext2.html">Ext2fs</a> project on sourceforge. A real live ext2 fsd for windows. Easily installed but pretty cryptic mount instructions. I had to know the disk id and volume id i was trying to mount, and i had a little trouble discovering them. But back to Explore2fs, it told me the disk and volume id, and then i could mount using Ext2Fs.</p>

<p>I am now happily copying all the files over.</p>
