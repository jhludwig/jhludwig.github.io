				<p><p>This holiday season, we particularly wanted to help out the families of servicemen and servicewomen who have made or are making significant sacrifices for all of us. We gave to three organizations:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.intrepidmuseum.org/foundation_heroesfund.html">Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund</a> – “The Fund provides unrestricted grants to the families of military personnel who have given their lives in the current operations in defense of our country. The gifts, $10,000 to each dependent family and an additional $5,000 per child, are intended to help these families through any immediate or long-term financial difficulties they may face.” * <a href="http://www.semperfifund.org">Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund</a> – “On May 18, 2004, a small group of concerned Marine Corps spouses founded the Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund to provide financial grants and other assistance to the Marines, sailors, and families of those injured serving our nation.” * <a href="http://www.aerhq.org/">Army Emergency Relief</a> – “AER funds are made available to commanders having AER Sections to provide emergency financial assistance to soldiers - active &amp; retired - and their dependents when there is a valid need.”</p>

<p>Thanks again to Winds of Change for maintaining <a href="http://www.windsofchange.net/archives/003234.php">this great list of pointers for ways to help the troops</a>.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Spent the last week in Hawaii – while on the beach:</p>

<p>* “Amnesia Moon”:amazon by Lethem. In the philip dick vein. Intersting core thesis about fracturing of reality as a response to an external threat. And I am sure that this is the only book I’ve ever read with a blurb by “mc 900 foot jesus”:amazon. How many people on the planet own cds by mc 900 foot jesus and have read this book? * “Snowfall”:amazon, “Kingdom River”:amazon by Mitchell Smith. Decent post apocalyptic yarn. In this case, set in north america sometime after a new ice age, and society has become much more primitive. In the first book, the action is paced well, and the unhappy endings for many of the ?good? protagonists creates a level of reality and pathos that tales of this sort normally don’t attain. The second book falls off quite a bit – pacing not as good and the hero is a bit too invincible. * “A frolic of his own”:amazon by Gaddis. Ok I hate to give up on a book part way thru. I feel like I am wasting the time I’ve already invested in the book, and I feel like I am letting the author defeat me in some strange intellectual contest. But I have to put this down after about 75 pages. I have no idea where the author is headed, I am not intrigued by the characters. The writing style is particularly annoying – we have perfectly good ways to punctuate conversation, why invent new ones which obscure meaning? I assume the author is making a point with this style, perhaps it ties back to the theme (a critique of our litigious culture per one of the jacket blurbs) but it is tiring. One of the jacket blurbs, from richard lacayo of Time magazine, says ?Practically rebuilds the Tower of Babel from the sounds and furies of the late 20th century.?. I have no idea what this means, I can’t make any sense of it, and so I guess it is a very fitting description of this book. * “Icarus”:amazon by Russell Andrews. Like mary higgins clark, only longer. And a bit dull at times. Length kind of beat some of the suspense out. * “Democracy in America”:amazon. I can see why this remains on so many recommended reading lists after 150 years; it is still a very relevant discussion of American politics and history. I am only partway thru but finding this very readable. When you’ve grown up in a particular system, you take so much of it for granted, it is fascinating to see it through someone else’s eyes. A great rehash of inheritance and estates early on that reminds me why estate taxes are not such a bad thing. * “Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell”:amazon. A trendy choice that I expected to dislike, but thia is a very good tale. Thematicallly like “tim powers”:amazon but with very deep characters. Like all stories of this ilk, the metaphysical windup is a bit mushy and nonsensical, but this is no worse than most. I found norrell’s transformation at the end a bit unbelievable, I’d like to have seen deeper development throughout the book of his guilt around introducing the main antagonist into the world, as I think this guilt was the motivator for him to eventually transform himself. Without this development, his transformation seemed a little pat. I’d give it an a- lots of loose ends, but I hope the author avoids doing a sequel as I don’t think wrapping up the loose ends will improve the story.</p>

<p>Rich some things to look at:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.pulver.com/products/sip/">Mega list of sip products</a> up at pulver.com * Another at <a href="http://www.sipcenter.com/sip.nsf/html/SIP+Phones+and+Adaptors">Sipcenter</a> * open source pbx – <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">asterisk</a></p>

<p>The problem I struggle with is this – I have a lot of cheap handsets around the house connected by cat5 back to my wiring closet to my existing pbx. If i replace this pbx – what hardware bridges out to all these analog handsets? Or do I replace them (at great cost) with sip handsets – are there any really cheap sip handsets?</p>

				<p><p>Some great posts I’ve found on the disaggregation of the PC in the home – we aren’t moving to bigger and bigger PCs in the home, but to elements of the computing environment spread all around:</p>

<p>All the most aggressive users of technology I talk to are moving to disaggregation of storage in the home, despite the current designs of pcs which generally don’t encourage this disaggregation.</p>

<p>So the market for fs value-add utilities will be strong for the rest of the decade – not just indexers, but replicators and synchers like <a href="http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Linux.html">unison</a>, <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001746.html">software raid and other lower level solutions</a>, etc. We all have way too much free disk space at our disposal, software will spring up to use it for reliability, performance, ease of use.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>For some reason, about two weeks ago, my IIS server (that this site resides on) quit being able to resolve DNS names. I’ve tried changing my DNS servers, no avail. I’ve tried turning off and turning on the DNS Client Resolver, no avail. The only config change I have made recently is to turn on the WebDAV extension in IIS, I turned that off, no avail.</p>

<p>This happened to me when I first installed XP Server 2003 and it was due to a 3rd-party socket filter that i had to remove. Going to investigate that next. Also going to look at ways to log the traffic at the IP level as i try to hit a named site to see what is happening.</p>

<p>Static pages on the site work fine obviously, but any kind of dynamic page tends to fall over.</p>

<p>Maybe it is time to move to a hosted solution. Not really having fun chasing this crap down.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: used the Network Monitor utility in XP to see that, for whatever reason, the DNS servers I had been using were returning “name not found” to all my requests. Further dug in and found that our ISP had provided us new DNS servers to use for our DMZ boxes a couple weeks ago. All fixed up now. Don’t really understand why the old DNS servers were still operational and still responding to DNS requests at all, but onward and upward.</p>

I’ve tried turning off and turning on the DNS Client Resolver, no avail. The only config change I have made recently is to turn on the WebDAV extension in IIS, I turned that off, no avail.</p>

<p>At the same time, enterprise storage functionality is transitioning down to consumers – <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/storage/lacie-external-sata-drives-027389.php">external sata connectors</a> allowing really high speed detached storage, <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/linux/archives/20041210_instant_nas.phtml">lightweight nas solutions</a>, a bunch of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=software+raid">software raid solutions</a> – but it is all way too hard to use for most people.</p>

<p>Seems to me like there is a path out of commodity pricing for the hard drive guys. The first player to bring enterprise storage functionality – replication, auto-backup, hot swapping, pooling, etc – to consumers and small businesses in a brainlessly easy to use package could be a big winner.</p>

				<p><p>Places we’ve hit recently…</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.supremerestaurant.com/">Supreme</a> in Madrona. Loved it! Great neighborhood place, super service, great food, a calm and relaxing place. * <a href="http://www.serafinaseattle.com/">Serafina</a>. The food was good, we’d go back, but it was very crowded and a little frantic. Good if you are in the mood for that. * <a href="http://www.firenzerestaurant.com/">Firenze</a>. One of our consistent favorites. Not in a very promising space, but great food e.very time. * <a href="http://www.gourmetfoodplaza.com/Series/Restaurants/QueenCityGrill.htm">Queen City Grill</a>. Another consistently good place. Not as trendy as some of the places in Belltown, but always good. * <a href="http://www.flyingfishseattle.com/">Flying Fish</a>. Did the chef just change? We were very disappointed there recently. Every dish was bland and poorly cooked. It will take some dramatic change for us to ever go back.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://www.openwave.com/us/news_room/press_releases/2003/20030915_opwv_reardon_0915.htm">Reardon</a> reminded me recently that I read a lot of books. I looked over <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/cat_books.html">the list</a> this year and was a little suprised myself. And what a lot of dreck in there, I wonder why I plow thru some of this.</p>

<p>But to save others from plowing thru the dreck, here is my short list of good reads this year. Some new, some quite old.</p>

<p><strong>Fiction</strong>:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312278497/qid=1081897958/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Glass Bead Game</a> by Hesse. 3/4s of a year later and I can still recollect vast swathes of the book as well as particular scenes. Well worth the time. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/103-6281811-4989432?index=blended&amp;keyword=The+Curious+Incident+of+the+Dog+in+the+Night-time">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</a>. Totally expected to hate it, thought it was just trendy, but this was a solid and memorable story. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802130208/qid=1082873989/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">A Confederacy of Dunces</a> by Toole. Great great characters, dying to be a movie. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/4770019572/qid=1084987282/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Musashi</a> from which I picked up <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001475.html">my favorite quote of the year.</a></p>

<p><strong>Non-fiction:</strong></p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm">The 9/11 Commission Report</a>. Again, every US citizen should read this. * And while you are at it, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Imperial Hubris</a>. At the very least, thought-provoking and internally consistent. * And lest these two depress you too much, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400041767/qid=1091718131/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig</a> for a view on a country and culture that is really screwed up.</p>

Why does the Windows Media Player make your codec config such a mystery? It is hard to tell what you have installed, unless you grovel the registry.</p>

<p>Lastly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2004/12/01/273160.aspx">a nice post from LarryO about hiding complexity</a>. This sure feels like the reason a lot of software goes wrong…</p>
