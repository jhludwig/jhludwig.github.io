<p>Not ready for primetime. Light is too directional, too blue, and not bright enough. But great for places like the garage where those problems aren’t an issue.</p>

				<p><p>Man these guys at <a href="http://www.cendant.com/">Cendant</a> are abusive.</p>

<p>Not for the first time, I got a $10 “check” in the mail apparently from Budget Rent A Car. In the fine print on the check it mentions that cashing will activate a membership in the National Home Protection Alliance program.</p>

<p>More fine print on the back. Wow, I also get a 2% rebate on all credit card purchases. Oh capped at $5000 of purchases, but $100 bucks is something. Oh and I get more discounts, and some kind of insurance benefit on household expenses.</p>

<p>Now the kicker. Well on in the fine print, I see it is going to cost me $39.99 a month for all this. $40 a month!!!! My gosh.</p>

<p>The entire piece of mail is designed to deceive. The true nature of the offer is buried in fine print. The casual customer of Budget will think they overpaid or something and are getting a legitimate refund.</p>

<p>I was going to write a letter to the CEO of Budget, suggesting that they might want to stop selling their customer names to Trilegiant, the organization that is sending out this abuse. But of course – Budget and Trilegiant are both subs of Cendant!</p>

<p>Bastards.</p>

				<p><p>OK while I was sick I found it hard to even read, but a few books did make it through:</p>

<p>* “Samaritan”:amazon by Richard Price. A great story of a guy whose need to help people is his undoing. A great cautionary tale – when you are trying to help people, don’t do it for your own gratification reasons, as this will often cause you to do the wrong things. Really put yourself in their shoes and help them in a way that is about them, not about you. * “The Year’s Best Science Fiction, 18th Annual Collection”:amazon, editted by Gardner Dozois. Always a great collection – a great way to get names of authors and books that you should read, rather than what the bookstore is promoting. * “Wolves Eat Dogs”:amazon by Martin Cruz Smith. I have no idea what moscow and the ukraine are like … But gosh, smith is good at transporting you, with very few words. Story drug a little long but great imagery. * “The Laughing Sutra”:amazon by Mark Salzman. Reco’d by a very smart friend. Interesting story, intertwining of myth and today. But compare/contrast with Martin Cruz Smith title – I never felt transported to China in this book, the imagery and dialog just didn’t do its job, this story could have been set anywhere.</p>

				<p><p>So after a week of playing with my new mac mini as my hometheater pc, i am mostly happy. I’ve configured it to grab downloaded AVIs (via bittorrent) off my windows file server – the mac connected pretty easily to windows, in some ways it is easier than connecting two xp machines. <a href="http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/avidivx.html">Per this guide</a>, i installed vlc to play the downloaded avis – works great. (Wow I had forgotten how easy it is to install apps on the mac).</p>

<p>Still looking for two things to complete the experience:</p>

<p>* a great 10 foot ui for playing avis and dvds. Myth is overkill, i don’t want all the pvr functionality, i just want the 10 foot UI. * a wireless remote. I have the bluetooth kb and mouse but I want a remote. Maybe this <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/airclick/index.php">griffin airclick</a> tho it doesn’t seem to be shipping yet?</p>

<p>So just a few more pieces and it will be perfect. And for once the mac is the price leader – <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BuildingYourOwnWindowsMediaCenterEdition2005HomeTheaterPCSystem.aspx">compare with windows-based systems that people are building</a>. And of course the mac is the style leader – compare with <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/610/stealth_littlepc_lpc-401fs">this ugly brute</a>.</p>

				<p><p>I’m way behind and so missed a lot of good stuff. But a few things I noticed on Ignition blogs (or blog posts about Ignition or its portfolio)…</p>

<p>* Rich is tracking the <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/02/14/vonage_running_bus_and_billboard_ads.html">emerging voip wars</a>, and the most recent <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net/consumer/2005/02/14/skype_is_coming_out_on_mobile.html">skype device announcement</a> – wow, isn’t this device the kind of thing that HP should have made back in the “HP Way” days? * The Jobster team has gone live with <a href="http://www.jobster.blogs.com">a company blog</a>. * A post I’ve been hanging onto for a while, Martin points to a blog all about <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2004/12/the_best_2004_l.html">the best of 2004</a> and wonders how to make a business out of. Does seem like a natural starting point for a nice little ecommerce business. * Martin also continues <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/01/hanging_with_th.html">his biodiesel adventure</a>… * One of the folks at Ignition has some Ethiopian family members – here is a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExplainingTheEthiopicNumberingSystemAndATinyLessonOnAmharic.aspx">cool post on the Ethopic number system</a>, I had no idea. * Some <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000637031287/">criticism of Melodeo’s service</a> – not sure I totally agree with, I think the Melodeo offering is a reasonable tradeoff of convenience and fairness, but I understand the point. * Rich’s pc hardware investigations – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/02/08/iscsi_for_home.html">iscsi at home</a> and <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/01/05/does_sli_matter.html">Does SLI matter (yes!)</a>. Crap, not only do I not have a water-cooled PC, now I also don’t have iSCSI or an SLI config. I am a loser. * Martin likes <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/01/my_new_favorite_1.html">these web radio stations.</a> I’ve never really understood the attraction, I am an ipod and in-car music listener. But I should try. * Nice press for <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/01/freeware_of_the_3.html">network magic</a> (disclosure – I’m on the board). * Fred <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=738">points to Martin’s posts</a> on tag systems. I am not a believer in tag systems. I think humans just want to do free text searches – let the computers figure out how to parse and tag content. But certainly a lot of heat around tags right now.</p>

				<p><p>My <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000788.html">Chevy Avalanche</a> has a blind spot in which you can hide Mount Rainer, it is just huge. Backing up has always terrified me as I could easily be running over a child, a horse, a small car, and I’d never know it.</p>

<p>The good folks at <a href="http://www.benchmarkmotoring.com/">Benchmark Motoring</a> helped me out – they installed a rearview camera with fisheye lens, just mounted above the trailer hitch. When I shift into reverse, it takes over the nav screen and displays a rear facing video feed.</p>

<p>I didn’t think it would help that much…but I am hooked. I can’t imagine ever getting any car without this again. Not only is it a great safety feature, but your parallel parking becomes brilliant with this. So much better than a rear view mirror. Highly recommended.</p>

				<p><p>Finally feeling good enough to start tinkering again, and to blog about it.</p>

<p>I’m continuing my odyssey to attach every piece of technology I can to my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001775.html">sharp aquous beast of a tv.</a> My Mac Mini arrived last week and I have it hooked up now to the DVI port. Looks great. The gotchas: Apple saves money by shipping the mini with no cables, so you have to go buy a DVI cable ($70 at least) and a stereo mini-jack cable (Aside – why does Apple even bother putting a speaker in the mac mini???). 2nd gotcha – the sharp defaults to an analog video signal from the pc, and you have to go wade thru the menus to force it to look for a digital signal – seems like this could be auto-detected. The mini makes a great hometheater pc – small, quiet, a fine dvd player. And I have bittorrent running on it to fill up the hard disk with tv content.</p>

<p>For additional fun I plugged a <a href="http://www.kingston.com/products/pccard.asp">kingston pcmcia hard drive</a> into the pcmcia port on aquous. What a bizarre feature. I can play slide shows and videos off the pccard. Oh and I can take snapshots and video captures of the current signal, as long as it is from a crappy analog input – analog coax, analog s-video. the tv won’t capture the signal from a digital input or from the component inputs, probably to make the mpaa et al happy. So basically it is a really funky and limited DVR. Just goes to show again how much trouble Tivo is in – it is trivial to slam DVR software into any box now, and storage is cheap.</p>

<p>I still have to fill up the hdmi and 1394 inputs…</p>

				<p><p>* First, read yesterday’s (1/27/05) front page WSJ article on the struggle between comcast and the tv networks/producers to deliver on-demand versions of popular programs. Comcast wants to screw the networks/producers, the content owners want to protect their revenue streams, and so users are left with nothing – or more exactly, users are pushed towards unfettered version of shows that leak out thru bittorrent or other means * The networks are in an untenable position – there is just no way to keep their content contained – even if they have the fanciest drm in the world, at some point the tv signal gets rendered onto an rgb/composite/s-video feed so you can see it – take look at <a href="http://WWW.RGB.COM">rgb.com</a>, you can pick up a box today that can capture 1600x1200, 25 frames per second, off a composite or rbg feed. I.E. there is no way to keep good digital copies from surfacing on the web. * Meanwhile, Tivo is under increasing pressure – and <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/01/early_adopters_.html">it looks like consumers will be satisfied with DVRs from their tv provider</a>, rather than buy a Tivo. Too bad because the Tivo experience is way superior to other DVRs – but the egos at Tivo and at the cable/satellite companies are destroying the Tivo business. * And now Apple is crowding into the picture with the stylish Mac mini – <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/cringely_on_the.html">pointer to Cringely</a>, Steve Makofsky on <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/the_mini_media_.html">why people like the mini (and wondering why they don’t like the PC in he same way)</a>, <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9519">reviews of the Mac Mini</a>. But there is no way to get a cable or satellite digital signal into a Mac Mini today – the video providers are dead set against that happening as it creates another way for digital copies to leak onto the net – so users lose out. Can Steve Jobs pull a rabbit out of his hat and solve this? * And of course Microsoft continues to grind away with the Media Center PC. And I think all these front end boxes need a great back end media store in the home – <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/566/axentra_net-box_home">something like this maybe?</a></p>

<p>Where will we all end up? Rich has some good thoughts about the <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/01/26/future_of_home_theater.html">refactoring of the TV experience</a> – and <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/01/25/future_of_video.html">some criticisms of everyone trying to create EPGs</a>. In the short term, Steve Makofsky points out that <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/are_codecs_the_.html">we are headed for greater complexity and confusion as we have to learn about codecs and other software components.</a></p>

<p>Who is going to be the champion of the user, the friend of the user?</p>
