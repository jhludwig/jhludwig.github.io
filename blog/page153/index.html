    <p><strong>Lyrics</strong>. Useful lyrics site – <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/index.html">A-Z Lyrics Universe</a>. I was looking for the lyrics to Foreigner’s “That Was Yesterday” which has been stuck in my head:</p>

<p><em>But that was yesterday I had the world in my hands But it’s not the end of my world Just a slight change of plans</em></p>

<p>A guilty pleasure. On a more fashionable note, the site also has the lyrics for all the White Stripes cds.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/08/06/hotmail.html">Hotmail</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Hotmail</strong>. Hotmail is declining in utility for me. The hotmail team has obviously started to break the HTTP-DAV interfaces so that I can no longer check email from Outlook or Outlook Express. I guess if I pay for extra storage or MSN8 that I will get the feature back, but given the silent unannounced breakage I am worried that it won’t be turned on very cleanly and supported well. And I have 4 hotmail accounts that I regularly check and I don’t want to pay for all of them separately.</p>

<p>I am going to start looking at other web-based email solutions. I guess I could host my own mail server but I am willing to pay a small amount to outsource it, I am not excited about taking on yet another IT task and management burden.</p>

    <p><strong>Gulf Islands</strong>. Just back from an 8 day trip in SW British Columbia.

Sydney has a beautiful harbour. The baby beluga at the <a href="http://www.vanaqua.org/">Vancouver aquarium</a> was great.</p>

<p>I used our new Kodak DX4900 4Mpixel digital camera with the Easyshare dock. I really love the dock, recharging and downloading pictures is way easier than with past cameras I’ve used.</p>

    <p><strong>Microsoft R&amp;D</strong>. <a href="http://www.paulandrews.com/2002/07/25">Paul Andrews</a> wonders if Microsoft can point to a “single successful original product to emerge from R&amp;D expenditure”.</p>

<p>I’d nominate the DirectX game api on Windows. Highly original work. The core of which was done in the company. A huge amount of economic activity stimulated above the interface (games) and below the interface (video and audio and controller hardware). The single most successful API set introduced on Windows in the last decade.</p>

<p>The Plug and Play work first in Win95 merits a mention as well.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/07/24/biz-plans.html">Biz plans</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Business Plans</strong>. Saw a great business plan presentation this week. Crisp, to the point, fact based, clear demonstration of the distinctive assets of the company. Little in the way of hyperbole about the market, the product architecture. I think some companies must forget that, as a vc, I’ve seen literally thousands of plans and presentations (and thousands more in my life pre-vc). My patience for fluff is gone.</p>

<p>Please please hone your plans and presentations. Tell us about the key people on the team and why they are winners. Tell us about the real customer and product progress you’ve made so far, not what you wish will happen. Be honest about what you don’t know – be honest about the risks and unknowns in your plan, and tell us how you will adapt if plans don’t come true. Be a skinflint in your plans and needs. Focus wins – be clear about your focus.</p>

<p>Now I’d love to hear from folks about how I can be a better prospective investor, from the viewpoint of a startup…</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/07/16/video-ripping-update.html">Video Ripping Update</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Video Ripping Update.</strong></p>

<p>So I am in the midst of moving all my DV and VHS-C home movies to DVD. Here’s my learning so far:</p>

<p>A. Allocate a lot of time. Ripping generally runs in realtime, and you make mistakes and need to rerip, and then you will want to analyze and clean up all the video and chapterize it. And I haven’t even gotten to dvd burning yet. Generally I would say you need to allocate at least 3-4 hours of time for every hour of video you bring in, and that is just to do the basics. If you want to really futz around with editting, add more. B. Buy a big hard disk. No, bigger. One 60minute DV tape was a 13Gig file on my system. my 120Gig NAS is going to disappear fast. C. The ATI all-in-wonder card is working well at the hardware level. But the bundled software is pretty indifferent. In particular the video capture stuff didn’t seem to handle DV well or analog well (it captured my analog in some wierd proprietary file type). D. Win XP Moviemaker was fine for DV capture. Tho slow – why does it go in realtime? I have a 1394 connection, the captured stream is 25Mbps, 1394 is 400Mbps, i should be able to move over the stream 16x faster than realtime but it didn’t seem to allow this? And it didn’t work at all for analog capture, it couldn’t seem to see my S-video input. E. The HP DVD writer (200 external) installed very easy. F. The <a href="http://www.arcsoft.com/products/software/en/showbiz.html">Arcsoft Showbiz</a> software bundled with the DVD has a goofy interface but seems easy to use to do basic chapterization and editting. But note – do not use the auto scene detection feature. It takes a LONG time to process a 13G file, and it doesn’t work – it split my file up into hundreds of snippets that didn’t match with the real scene delineation points at all. Maybe there is something smart I am supposed to do at filming time to tag the scenes.</p>
