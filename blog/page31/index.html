				<p><p>OK I am still “stymied by a linker problem”:http://theludwigs.com/2012/09/trying-to-get-set-up-a-raspberry-pi-dev-environment-on-osx/ in getting a native OSX Raspberry Pi dev environment set up. Stymied might be a strong word, I haven’t looked the make file nor have I spent any time cruising the various forums to see if there is an answer to my problem.</p>

<p>That is because I have moved on to another approach – a vm-based approach. And I am successfully compiling now. The setup:</p>

<p>* Install the “Virtual Box”:https://www.virtualbox.org OSX software, and create a new Ubuntu VM. * Download the latest “Ubuntu image”:http://www.ubuntu.com/download * Bring up the VM, and then follow the recipe at “elinux”:http://elinux.org/RPi_Kernel_Compilation for a foreign Ubuntu machine. Note that these instructions assume you are transferring the image over to a raspberry pi and have a lot of extra steps. I am just trying to get to an image I can run in an emulator, and so once the kernel is compiled, I can flip over to the instructions at… * …“RPIForum”:http://www.rpiforum.net/forum/tutorials/article/16-a-raspberry-pi-emulated-environment-on-osx-lion/. I could run the QEMU emulator inside Virtual Box at this point, but running an emulator inside a vm seems a little nutty. So at this point I can pull the zImage image out of the VM and run the native osx qemu emulator.</p>

<p>So still a little Rube-Goldbergian, but working and viable. And since most of the work is done in a VM, I can move the setup over to a Windows machine or a Linux machine or wherever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The boards do not include NAND or NOR storage - everything is on the SD card, which has a FAT32 partition with GPU firmware and a kernel image, and an EXT2 partition with the rootfs. We’re not currently using a bootloader - we actually boot via the GPU, which contains a proprietary RISC core (wacky architecture). The GPU mounts the SD card, loads GPU firmware and brings up display/video/3d, loads a kernel image, resets the SD card host and starts the ARM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was hopelessly confused as to why I needed a kernel image and a system disk image until I read this. It is no goofier than the PC BIOS but is just different.</p>

I’d like to have a cross compiler, a full linux build, an emulator all operational.</p>

<p>There is a pretty clear outline at “RPIforum from earlier this summer”:http://www.rpiforum.net/forum/tutorials/article/16-a-raspberry-pi-emulated-environment-on-osx-lion/. I’ve had partial success:</p>

<p>* Install Xcode and Xcode command line tools. No problem, I had these around anyway * Install “homebrew”:http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/. A package manager for OSX, a good thing to have. Installing this is what finally “broke my existing flawed OSX install”:http://theludwigs.com/2012/09/beware-the-osx-migration-assistant/ and drove me to reinstall OSX. But installed super cleanly once I had a fresh OSX * Install the dependencies for ARM toolchain: brew install mpfr gmp libmpc libelf texinfo. There is a known error with mpfr compilation, so reinstall that with flags “per homewbrew wiki”:https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/15061. * Then install the Arm tools. BTW, you can’t just copy and past the script from the RPI forum page because of the damn smart quotes – echo “export PATH=$HOME/rpi/arm-cs-tools/bin:$PATH” » ~/.bash_profile will utterly fail * Then compile kernel. This step is unfortunately failing late in the process, I think at the linking stage. Still digging into. I have tried an alternative recipe at “the elinux site”:elinux.org/RPi_Kernel_Compilation, it fails as well, in both cases unhappy with the vmlinux file. * Then install the qemu emulator. the rpi forum recipe is missing a dash, should be a double dash in front of the use-gcc flag i believe. works fine with that change</p>

<p>So I feel close. Just need to dig into the kernel compile problem. Here are the details, I need to study the make file to figure out exactly where this occurs:</p>

<p>``</p>

<p>==&gt; make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=~/rpi/arm-cs-tools/bin/arm-none-eabi- -k &gt; compile.txt size: file: arch/arm/boot/compressed/../../../../vmlinux is not an object file size: file: arch/arm/boot/compressed/../../../../vmlinux is not an object file size: file: arch/arm/boot/compressed/../../../../vmlinux is not an object file size: file: arch/arm/boot/compressed/../../../../vmlinux is not an object file arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux.lds:77: undefined symbol <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__OBJC' referenced in expression make[2]: *** [arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux] Error 1 make[1]: *** [arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux] Error 2 make[1]: Target </code>arch/arm/boot/zImage’ not remade because of errors. make: *** [zImage] Error 2 make: Target <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_all' not remade because of errors.</code>`</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>When I got my Retina Macbook Pro, I used the migration assistant to transfer over all my docs and apps. I had used it in the past and it had worked fine.</p>

<p>But this time, my experience was different. First, it struggled with the amount of picture and music content I tried to transfer over, something about 200G+ of data didn’t make it happy. I ultimately just copied over my iTunes and Aperture libraries manually.</p>

<p>But the bigger problem is that the migration utility refused to copy apps and docs from the “John” account on my old macbook pro to the “John” account on the new machine. It mumbled about the account already existing and demanded I used a new account.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2995807604_219f46cbf9_m.jpg"><img src="images/2995807604_219f46cbf9_m.jpg" alt="" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/uwehermann/" /></a>And this ended up being a disaster. I’ve suffered thru a couple months of a constant chown/chmod fest and I have given up. Nothing wants to run, and sudo doesn’t even reliably solve.</p>

<p>So yesterday I nuked the whole SSD and put a fresh install of Mountain Lion on the machine. I downloaded Mountain Lion from the app store, used “Lion Diskmaker”:http://blog.gete.net/lion-diskmaker-us/ to put it on a usb key, rebooted in rescue mode, formatted the SSD, and reinstalled Mountain Lion. And then reinstalled the 50 or os apps, reconnected mail/cal/contacts to all my accounts, reinstalled plugins for xcode, aperture, safari, etc, copied over my Aperture and iTunes library and docs from a network store, and am pretty much back up and running.</p>

<p>Lesson learned. I’m not the only person in the world that has hit this, here is a “good description of the core problem”:http://pondini.org/OSX/MigrationProblems.html and the many ways you can try to solve. One wonders why anyone thought this was a reasonable way for the migration assistnat to act.</p>

<p>This seems obvious to me. At the limit, if you disclose nothing:</p>

<p>* Your opponent must assume that all your best players will play * Your opponent thus must prep for your best possible effort * Your opponent may get an upside surprise when they find you field a weaker team than for which they prepped.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you disclose every possible injury:</p>

<p>* Your opponent will see that many of your players may be limited * Your opponent may not plan for your best effort * Your opponent may get a downside surprise when they find you field a stronger team than they expected.</p>

<p>It seems obvious to me that you should disclose every injury, major or minor.</p>

<p>* https://twitter.com/lobrien/status/247408555651645440 * https://twitter.com/doozerblake/status/247407834130690048 * https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/247403381012975616 * https://twitter.com/timsonofsteve/status/247413105750077440</p>

<p>The shared assertion is – the lack of easily available health insurance is preventing a lot of people from joining or creating startups. Nothing scientific about this data, it is all anecdotal, but I certainly empathize with the view. Health insurance has certainly been a factor in my personal career decisions over the last decade. I know a half dozen people who have wrestled with the issue as they have considered startup opportunities. My sense is that people are willing to take a lot of salary and equity risk, but they can’t put their family’s healthcare at risk, particularly if they are starting young families.</p>

<p>The current US system is certainly biased towards employment with large established employers. I wonder if the upcoming legislated changes will help to create more movement to small businesses and startups. I wonder if we couldn’t do even more to a) make movement to startups easy, and b) provide coverage in the event of startup failure, so that personal risk is minimized.</p>

<p>There is a lot of wailing and teeth gnashing about our patent system and how that is an impediment to entrepreneurs, but I can’t help but wonder if access to healthcare and health insurance is an even greater impediment.</p>

<p>Update: Marcello wrote a “very reasoned piece”:http://www.geekwire.com/2012/healthcare-reform-todays-ruling-great-news-startups/ on this topic in June, worth a look.</p>

<p>* “The Snow Whale”:amazon by John Minichillo. Don’t know why I picked this up, exactly the kind of satirical farce I hate. Gave up on, blah. * “The Master and his Emissary”:amazon by Iain McGilchrist. Get your pith helmet and machete, this is a deep jungle to fight your way thru. Deep exploration of brain function, psychology, philosophy, history, art, culture. The sections on philosophy just about killed me (which given the thesis I find very intriguing and perhaps even a bit concerning.). Fascinating but set aside a long time to read and ponder. I don’t buy the arguments completely but an interesting and well-detailed articulation of a theory of human culture and how it relates to brain function. One area where the argument rings hollow to me is the discussion of modern music. The author attempts to support his core argument with evidence of the emotionless nature of modern classical music, but gives only one sentence to jazz and completely ignores the music that people actually listen to, pop and rock. I don’t think removing this one support point damages his argument, but it does make me wonder about the overall quality of the argument. But still, a very well thought out discussion and worth reading and thinking about. * “The Prophet”:amazon by Michael Koryta. Needed some light fare to recover from the previous slog. A solid mystery set in smalltown northern Ohio with some character complexity. Fun but not remarkable. * “Where’d you go, Bernadette”:amazon by Maria Semple. OK at first this seemed like light farce and I kind of hated it. I stuck with it just for the Seattle setting but thought “Wow, if you are not in the Seattle/Microsoft network, you will get nothing out of this.” And then the book took a left turn when Bernadette opened up and revealed herself, and became a terrific tale of self discovery, of a mother and a daughter, of love, loss, and reunion. Really enjoyed it, it has been optioned for a movie, hope they pull this one together.</p>

				<p><p>Having installed two ipfire boxes now, some simple tips. Overall it is a pretty straightforward install but these may save you a few minutes:</p>

<p>* You can find this in the online doc, but during install, remember: red is your wan connection; green is your local lan; and blue is your local wifi. You need cards for at least red and green or the install will flip out.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/netsnag.jpg"><img src="images/netsnag.jpg" alt="" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brunogirin/" /></a> * Post install, you can only admin from the green subnet, which is totally sensible. And if you install ssh, it is only active by default on the green subnet, again totally reasonable. * Post install, your wifi network will be inert and useless. You have to further install the hostapd extension using the pakfire command line or gui, and then configure the ssid and password, turn on dhcp, and further enable the mac addresses of each wireless device you want to support. Online guides suggest you also need to install wifi card drivers but this doesn’t seem to be needed, the lastest ipfire build seems to include them. Blue useless. * I’d highly recommend installing the ssh extension. also tcpdump. I have a bunch others installed too. * The samba extension doesn’t seem to work well, all my machines have trouble authenticating to the ipfire box. samba seems to offer a kajillion security settings and i can’t find quite the right combo to work.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fireball.jpg"><img src="images/fireball.jpg" alt="" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/focalintent/" /></a>We have a new firepit at our house fed by a propane tank. It is a very simple design – tank, firepit, burner. Light it and go. It has been many years since we have dealt with propane, and I have forgotten most of hard-won knowledge. I am reminded of my all-time favorite camping joke:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A novice skydiver was taking his first jump. The instructor was reminding him in the plane “When it is time to deploy your chute, pull the ring on the left. If for any reason that doesn’t work, don’t worry, count to ten and pull the ring on the right. And if for some unlikely reason that doesn’t work, reach behind you and pull this tab, the chute is guaranteed to come out.”.</p>

  <p>So the novice leapt out of the plane, counted to ten, and pulled the ring on the left. Nothing. No need to panic, the skydiver thought, I know what to do, I’ll pull the right ring in ten.</p>

  <p>He counted to ten, and then pulled the right ring. Again nothing. Again he thought, no need to panic, I’ll pull the rear tab. And he did, and again nothing.</p>

  <p>So there he was, plummeting to the earth, wondering what to do. And he noticed, down and to his left, a man skyrocketing upward from the earth. Well, the skydiver thought, he must know what he is doing. And so he yelled over to the man, “Hey, do you know anything about parachutes?”</p>

  <p>And the man yelled back “No, do you know anything about propane stoves?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you haven’t used propane, unlike a lot of gases, it is heavier than air, and it likes to invisibly pool in every nook and cranny, and then ignite all at once. Which is exciting in a “you didn’t really want those eyebrows” kind of way.</p>

<p>A modest bit of research on the web reveals that our simple firepit probably needs a bit more complexity in its “burner design”:http://www.moderustic.com/Propane-Burners.html if we would like to have less exciting evening fires. In my defense, I didn’t design this firepit, but I probably should have asked a few more questions about it as it was being built.</p>

				<p><p>* Halloween is soon, and “MonsterGuts”:http://monsterguts.com/index.php always has great props and prop controllers if you just want to buy something and get it working right away. Their thunder and lighting controllers are great, I’ve used for years. I don’t know if I am doing any Halloween display this year but I do love all the stuff up here. But sometimes you just want to build your own effects from the ground up, so… * “Raspberry Pi”:http://www.raspberrypi.org/. A $25 linx SBC, very cool. But you can’t get one of the damn things, they are as rare as hen’s teeth. So I’ve been reading, but not actually playing with one. So in the meantime * “Arduino”:http://www.arduino.cc/. You can get these by the bushel, and there are a ton of accessories – sensors, actuators, add on boards, you name it. “Adafruit”:http://adafruit.com/ and “Sparkfun”:http://www.sparkfun.com/ both have all kinds of addons and kits. I could spend thousands here. The LED and EL lighting products are kind of amazing. * Atom motherboards. You can’t find a Raspberry Pi and the Arduino is too underpowered? Well there are a ton of Atom motherboards with great prices, case or caseless, etc. I’m building a couple different appliances. * Starting to play with “KVM”:http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page a little too, some of the Atom motherboards support. No strong reason, just to learn. * “IPFire”:http://www.ipfire.org/. One of my boxes is running IPFire so I can monitor and control net traffic at a finegrained level. “pfsense”:http://www.pfsense.org/ is another way to go but I found it be much more finicky to install (probably due to BSD roots). * “Cinemagraphs using the MSFT Cliplet tool”:http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/cliplets/. These are kind of fun. Opens your eyes to the future of photo taking and photo postprocessing. Increasingly I think our cameras will just capture a continuous high res data stream and then smart software will extract the interesting views. * I’ve gone 2 factor authentication nuts, turning it on everywhere I can. It does make stuff a little more painful to use but probably worth it. Facebook does seem a little confused, I can’t get it to remember machines I’ve used, and so it keeps asking me to name new machines so it can remember them. I have 37 login machines on facebook now, :(</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/chases-privacy-notification-ive-never-bothered-to-read-one-of-these-before">Chase's "Privacy Notification" -- I've never bothered to read one of these before</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">21 August 2012</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/privacy.jpg"><img src="images/privacy.jpg" alt="" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/" /></a>I received a Privacy Notification from Chase this week, I have a credit card with them. I usually just throw these things in the trash, I’ve always figured they had nothing good to say.</p>

<p>But as a lark, I decided to read this one on my morning walk. It is impressive for its sheer audaciousness.</p>

<p>* What Chase collects can include, but is not limited to, SSN, income, transaction history, account balances, payment history, credit history. OK none of this particularly offends, I am not suprised, they need much of this to operate their card business, tho “transaction history” could cover a lot of info – just the dates, amounts, merchants, or can they work with merchants to amass even more info on exactly what products I buy? Again, tho, this is not an overly surprising or concerning list.</p>

<p>* Chase can share this information with any company or any person on the planet for Chase’s everyday business purposes (processing transactions, maintaining account, responding to court orders, reporting to credit bureaus), for Chase’s own marketing purposes, for joint marketing with any other financial company, and for the use by affiliates or subsidiaries for their everyday business purposes. And I have no control over this, I cannot as a consumer stop or limit this sharing at all. I am pretty sure that “everyday business purposes” and “joint marketing with any other financial company” can be stretched to cover every possible use on the planet, so basically Chase can do whatever they want with my info with whoever they want.</p>

<p>* I can only limit: Chase sharing my creditworthiness with affiliates/subs (big deal, they can all go get the info themselves from Experian/etc), affiliates or nonaffiliates marketing to me (again big deal, since Chase reserves the right to do joint marketing with any of these).</p>

<p>* If I quit being a Chase customer, Chase reserves the right to keep and share my information forever. Nice.</p>

<p>* And why can’t I limit any other sharing? Because Federal law doesn’t require Chase to give you the power to. So basically Chase is saying, “we have no moral or ethical standards, we will share right up to the limit of the law, we don’t care whether it is in your best interest or not”.</p>

<p>After reading all this, I have a pretty good sense of how Chase views me as a customer – just something to be exploited or used as they see fit without regard to my concerns. I’m not shocked, it is not like I ever expected to have a warm and fuzzy relationship with my credit card company. But I did kind of feel like they were making enough money on their explicit fees – merchant fees, annual fees, late fees, interest charges – and that they didn’t need to sell me to any and all comers to juice their returns.</p>

<p>I will probably start to think harder about my bank choices now. I’m curious about online alternatives like “Simple”:https://www.simple.com/. I’d like to find an institution that promises to protect my money, privacy, and identity first and foremost, that requires opt-in for any other use, that shares only the absolute minimum to credit agencies (I certainly accept that any bank will share information about my non-performance with the world, it is my responsibility to meet my obligations).</p>
