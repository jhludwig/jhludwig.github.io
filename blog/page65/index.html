  <h1><a href="/2007/03/22/recent-books-an-eclectic-mix.html">Recent books -- an eclectic mix</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “Remainder”:amazon by tom McCarthy. The tale of a severely brain injured man attempting to recover his life. Vaguely promising premise but I could never really identify with the main or secondary character. Certainly a unique tale though. * “The Shia Revival”:amazon by Nasr. i am not very well educated on modern islam – sunni, shia, wahabi, sufi, all means little to me. this was a fine first book to read – explained enough of the history to understand the genesis of the various strains, and explains the regional politics that are intertwined with the divisions in islam. and brings it all forward to the current situation in iraq, iran, and the rest of the middle east. a very helpful text. i am sure this author has some biases, it would probably be smart to read a few more texts to get a start on understanding the current conflicts. * “Creative concrete ornaments for the garden”:amazon by Hunter. Nice intro to basic concrete techniques. Purely decorative uses, not for structural elements. * “About Alice”:amazon by Trillan. Short soothing sweet read about lifelong love. Quietly inspiring. Calming.</p>

    <p>A <a href="http://www.telenav.com/" title="TeleNav - Always find your way!">TeleNav!</a> app was slammed on my blackberry today. I didn’t ever install it, it just showed up on the homescreen. Basically a kind of spam from cingular I assume.</p>

<p>Anyway i tried it. It wasn’t terrible, but I can’t see why anyone would bother, the google maps app is so much better. The telenav app is a bit of size/speed pig, it doesn’t show traffic data, no satellite views, no white/yellow pages lookup, an annoying upsell ad on the front page. I deleted it.</p>

    <p>I’m in like 10 different pools, my view on various pool managers:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://hoops.pickspal.com/Members/Results.aspx" title="PicksPal Bracket 2007 - NCAA Tournament - March Madness">PicksPal Bracket 2007 - NCAA Tournament - March Madness</a> – easy to enter, a lot of ad content but not annoyingly so. Entire bracket on one page which is nice. * <a href="http://mayhem.sportsline.com/splash/mayhem/spln/opm">Sportsline</a>. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that they show you consensus pick info dynamically as you pick teams – this is freaking awesome. OK the math is sometimes bizarrely wrong but still. My favorite. * <a href="http://tournament.fantasysports.yahoo.com/men">Yahoo</a>. A fine choice. Not fancy but works well. * <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/tcmen/frontpage">ESPN</a>. The worst. Abusive ad content – in tooltips popups, in between regions as you fill in your bracket. I won’t bother to fill in anymore at this site and i would certainly never host one here.</p>
