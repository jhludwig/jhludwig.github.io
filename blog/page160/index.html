				<p><p>Been a busy couple of weeks…</p>

<p>* <a href="http://WWW.lostremote.com/archives/002971.html">Comcast deploying MSFT software</a> – how do I get on the trial? Will it work with <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001197.html">my existing fairly new comcast pvr settop box?</a> The comcast/moto provided software is so clunky, I would love an alternative. * Looks like a little ecosystem of <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=16505954-c444-4d24-aa94-475bb26c1c58">media center addins</a> is developing… * <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7685703146968882/">MSN remote record</a> will let you remotely futz with your media center box…</p>

<p>It’s too bad that it is so hard for consumers to get their hands on all the above – waiting for your cable company to roll the features out is no way to kickstart a market, nor is depending on new pc purchases. Contrast with the <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1719938,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532">Halo2 release</a> which is going to be a huge hit – consumers have an easy way to acquire the product.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: according to someone who should know re the comcast/msft offering, “This is not a trial ? it?s full fledged commercial deployment to over a million subscriber in Washington state. The software will be eventually downloaded to all set top boxes including the older stuff, but I would warmly recommend upgrading to Comcast?s new dual-tuner DVR with HD. It?s a steal at $9.95 a month and if you already have HD, it?s only $4.95. You can order it starting next week”. I can’t find it on the comcast web site yet but I’ll check daily.</p>

I guess I just found this book to be somewhat engaging. The most notable thing about the book is the unusual writing style – thoughts and actions from the viewpoints of multiple characters are intermixed, it takes some fine parsing to sometimes figure out what was action, what was thought, and who was doing it. Is this Saramago’s normal style or was it crafted for this book to convey the confusion and disorientation caused by the world-wide blindness? As far as the story itself, a parable about human nature, how quickly we can descend, and how people can still maintain dignity and hope – well it was a bit of a yawner for me, I think this theme is better explored thru reading actual history books and biographies of world war II or other episodes.</p>

				<p><p>I have to say I am not very happy so far.</p>

<p>I am using the iPod with a windows laptop that has no cd drive. So first i downloaded iTunes 4.7 and installed (well, updated the version of iTunes that was on the machine).</p>

<p>then I attached the photo iPod. oops, doesn’t work, i also need to download the iPod updater, install, and reboot.</p>

<p>Reattach the iPod. It is auto updated. Then I need to detach it and plug it into the wall so it completes the reflash.</p>

<p>Reattach again. All my songs and photos are on a network drive and iTunes claims they are not available. Well they are. Looked all over iTunes for an option to force it to recheck availability. Never found anything, finally selected all of my tracks and told itunes to play them. after a looooong time, itunes finally decided all the songs were available.</p>

<p>detach and reattach the ipod photo. songs updated automatically. now i grovel thru the options dialogs to point it at my photos. looonnng time synching as it downconverts all my photos.</p>

<p>ok i don’t really want downconverted photos, i want the ipod to be a backup of all my photos. click the option to bring over full copies and resync.</p>

<p>ok finally i am ready. i hook the ipod photo up to my tv thru an aux port and try a photo slideshow. hmmm, the photos show up on the ipod photo, but on the tv i only see the first photo, it never changes.</p>

<p>sigh. will try again later today.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The <a href="http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?14@169.FDfGaOrDA9q.1@.689e0193">iPod support site has a relevant discussion</a> which seems to have made my slideshows work. So I am happier, the iPod is fully functional now. Still a total pain to set up tho.</p>

				<p><p>All over the map here. Probably some pithy summary to write about how apps and data of the future should be partitioned and hosted.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000028.html" title="Adam Bosworth's Weblog: Evolution in Action">Adam Bosworth’s Weblog: Evolution in Action</a>: <em>The user interface customized itself to the users needs, location, and data in a dynamic way through the magic of dynamic page layout. Today, a full ten years later, most windows apps still don’t do that. But heck they are only 2 or 3 or 4 generations evolved. Services, in the last decade, may have evolved 600 times by now all in reaction to what they have learned directly from customer use.</em> A pithy observation. * From <a href="http://www.windley.com/2004/11/03.html#a1505">windley.com</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_7/102-4131696-2978514?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;node=13584001&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA">Amazon’s Simple Queue Service.</a> Interesting that AMZN would offer such a general purpose service. * Jon Udell on the <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/29.html#a1104">myth of the one true device</a>.

				<p><p>…is not the presidential results. I am sure the country will muddle through whoever is inhabiting that office.</p>

<p>The thing that is of most local, immediate importance to me is the failure of I-884, the education funding initiative. I’m suprised about the totality of the failure here. Obviously the electorate does not like new taxes. It is obviously going to take way more effort to increase our educational funding – it is going to take unified statewide political support – both parties, all major state and federal elected officials – as well as private sector leaders to ever push any significant educational funding package through.</p>

				<p><p>Great weather! Near full moon, clear and crisp, no rain, very little wind. Perfect for fog creation and fog persistence…</p>

<p>Had our first visitors saturday nite – friends. Plus a lot of drivebys that evening.</p>

<p>Sunday the traffic started early – 4pm – some friends, and parents bringing children who were too scared to come at night.</p>

<p>Crush started at 6. Last visitors at 9:20. We had a shopping cart and a half of candy, and had to start rationing at 8:00. We ended up with just a dozen pieces of candy left.</p>

<p>Lots of ?scream? masks. Lots of teenagers with the slightest attempts at costumes. Princesses, witches. Martial arts.</p>

<p>Best props – fog as always, kids love fog. My demented disfigured monk costume, a lot of people thought I was a prop. Lots of tombstones and skeletons. Our haunted talking tree – popular with all ages.</p>

<p>Bugs: Pneumatics good but finicky. Need to invest a lot more in the offseason on testing and construction of pneumatics. Audio – sound quality great but inflexible – discrete sound sources hardwired via speakerwire to outdoor speakers. Really need a virtual soundboard and retargetable delivery over ip, but weather and power present issues.</p>

<p>Pix later this week.</p>
