	<meta name="description" content="* Adrian is trying out EDGE for wireless connections. Sounds good. I am tired of futzing around with crappy public wifi access points. Couple it with a box like this and you can run your own hotspot where you need it. * Brad in a thread on .net and vcs from this summer. Like he says, we’re agnostic. We can’t afford to be technology bigots. * Martin points out that biodiesel is now cheaper here than regular diesel. Exciting times for energy investors. * I’m a sucker for optical illusions – nice one from phil. * Rich is in love with a9 maps and misquotes me. I think what I was really trying to say is Google is finally figuring out how to be sticky. They are providing a platform now that hundreds of apps are using. As they expand and get thousands of apps to use their underlying service, well that will be quite an asset. * People inside Microsoft took note of the aggressive recruiting that our friends at Judy’s Book and Mpire co-sponsored. Nice work guys! * Phil keeps cranking on his blackberry app – find jobs on your phone, and his app will be featured in an upcoming bberry hacks book. Nice.
