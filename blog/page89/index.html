    <p>It is all coming crashing down around me right at the moment. I don’t feel like I have gadgets and gear, I just have problems.</p>

<p>On my person/in my bag: my blackberry keys are sticking and i have to replace it, my casio digital camera won’t hold a charge.</p>

<p>In my car: the kenwood phatdisk hard disk is corrupt, my nav system is out for repairs.</p>

<p>At work: the vpn has become slow as mud, our firewall is crashing daily, my server box has only 256Meg of ram and is thrashing, i can’t quite configure properly my hosting service for 3 new domains.</p>

<p>At home: firefox 1.02 crashes repeatedly on my main machine. Firefox won’t run at all in user mode on the family room machine. I have hard disk corruption on my game machine. The hard disk in the PC I use to control all my halloween sounds is whining suspiciously. my 10 year old phone system is creaking as i attempt to slam voip into it.</p>

<p>A whole host of things are working ok – my ipod, my tivo, my comcast hd, the two other pcs and the mac mini at home. But the problems are all a little overwhelming at the moment. I may need to massively simplify. I can’t keep spending 3 hours a day fixing things…</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/03/22/contacting-me.html">Contacting Me</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>In a boring meeting the other day, I was reflecting on how many ways people can get ahold of me. I did a little inventory.</p>

<p>Voice: You can call me at:</p>

<p>* 425 709 0772. Ignition central number. Accepts Voicemail * 425 460 0841. Ignition direct number. Accepts Voicemail * 425 922 7055. Cell phone. Accepts Voicemail. * 425 641 4973. Home listed. Accepts Voicemail. * 425 xxx xxxx. Home unlisted. Accepts Voicemail. * 425 xxx xxxx. Onstar in Chevy Avalanche. * 425 xxx xxxx. Vonage. Accepts Voicemail.</p>

<p>Fax: You dinosaur you, you can send me a fax at:</p>

<p>* 425 709 0798. Ignition * 425 xxx xxxx. Vonage.</p>

<p>IM: The younger set can reach me at:</p>

<p>* Jhludwig on AIM * Jhludwig AT hotmail.com on MSN (deprecated)</p>

<p>Email: My most used medium.</p>

<p>* ignitionpartners.com: john, jhludwig, johnlu. Actually a few more are also supported that I’ve set up over the years for various purposes. * fanblogs.com: John. For college football stuff * hotmail.com: jhludwig * gmail.com: john.ludwig * exmsft.com: johnlu (need to verify this still works) * attwireless.blackberry.net: jhludwig (direct to blackberry) * a few other domains i have registered which forward mail to me. * i never bothered to set up my comcast isp account, i guess that could work to, but don’t use it, since i never check it.</p>

<p>Text: again for the younger generation</p>

<p>* SMS me at the cell phone above * Or from a blackberry, send to Bberry pin 20053854</p>

<p>Blog:</p>

<p>* Send a trackback to an entry on theludwigs.com * Trackback or comments on fanblogs</p>

<p>Forums:</p>

<p>* Posts on MethodsofMadness halloween forum * Posts on some school forums</p>

<p>Redirects</p>

<p>* Ebay I believe will redirect messages to my account * All the social networking sites – linkedin, judysbook, friendster, orkut, etc – will send posts/messages to me</p>

<p>Physical mail:</p>

<p>* to ignition * to home</p>

<p>And well you can just Google “john ludwig” and probably figure out a way to get ahold of me. especially now that this is posted.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is – I will actually get all these. I monitor all these inputs on a semiregular basis. Some of them constantly, some more intermittently, but I get them all.</p>

<p>Contrast this situation with the beginning of my working life. I had 1 work phone, 1 work fax, 1 home phone at that time. No email, no sms, no cellphone, etc.</p>

<p>Will this explosion continue? How will people stay on top of it all? The big problem is really controlling use and access. Today I conrol access by deciding to whom and how I reveal these addresses. And then as the addresses leak out, I filter them for unwanted contacts. This seems pretty bass-ackwards. I’d like to be able to publish all of them freely, and then decide based on access lists and rules who is allowed to use which of them.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/03/21/home-cooling.html">Home cooling</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I am certainly on the bleeding edge here – but in the next 5-10 years home cooling is going to get more complicated than it is today.</p>

<p>I’ve got 4 pcs, a network attached printer, various scanners and cameras, a vonage ata box, hubs, speakers, monitors, router, cable modem, and phone system in my office/server room. Naturally a hot room, but it has become unbearable on sunny days – and so I’ve had to add a dedicated air conditioner for this room.</p>

<p>My media center has a similar problem – the cabinet next to my screen contains a receiver/amp, directivo box, comcast box, dvd, vcr, ld player, etc. I’ve had to punch a hole in a wall and install a fan to vent out to the garage.</p>

<p>The heat generated by consumer electronics is just too much. (Attendant with this is the fan noise problem which can be addressed by clever heat sinks and other designs – but you can’t design away the waste heat).</p>

<p>If I was building a new house I’d explicitly design for these issues. Ventilation, extra thermostats, extra cooling capacity – it is a pain to add this stuff later. House HVAC design is going to get way more complicated.</p>

<p>We can do some things to address the problem – <a href="http://www.geekbooks.com/compact_fluorescent_light_bulbs_2005.htm">moving away from incandescent bulbs for instance</a> – I’ve done that in my problem rooms already. But the problem is just going to grow as we add more sophisticated electronics into our life – I am currently reading “The Bottomless Well”:amazon, on which I’ll write a full review later, but it is pretty convincing that we are going to have more waste heat, not less to deal with, in the future.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/03/20/working-around-comcast-problems.html">Working around comcast problems</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve given up on comcast <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001813.html">fixing their IP lease time issues</a>, I am still seeing very short lease times a week+ later.</p>

<p>I have found that my old sonicwall firewall was particularly perturbed by these short leases, so i replaced it with a <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&amp;scid=35&amp;prid=565">Linksys WRV54G</a> that I had purchased a while ago. No amount of coercion could make it work with the xbox tho – i tried port forwarding, turning on and off upnp, assigning the xbox a static ip and putting it into the dmz, etc. Just never clicked.</p>

<p>So I printed out <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/connect/routerlanding.htm">Microsoft’s advice on compatible routers</a> and trundled off to Fry’s this AM. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Microsoft’s list is very stale, not a single router with these model numbers is actually for sale anymore. So i picked up a <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=1&amp;pid=272">dlink DI-704UP</a> -- I know dlink has great market share, and the number was similar to a router that was supposed to be compatible. Works fine.</p>

    <p>* “Light, by M. John Harrison”:amazon. Good science fiction romp – quantum behaviour brought into our everyday lives – very imaginative. * “Fairyland, by Paul J. McAuley”:amazon. A near future story involving the extreme interplay of cypernetics, nanotech, and genetic engineering – quite inventive intermixing of these and their impact on humans and human society. Characters sometimes a little thin – or maybe so transhuman as to be unsympathetic. Deftly handled resolution – didn’t try to answer every question. Of these first two books, I’d read Fairyland. * “Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress”:amazon. Very funny. After reading this, I feel like I have been too grown up my entire life. My favorite line – describing a modern modular wall entertainment center as the “deathstar of furniture”.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/03/13/comcast-dhcp-problems.html">Comcast DHCP problems</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK in the last four days Comcast has cut my IP address lease times down to 2 hours. At at the end of that two hours there are often 3-5 minutes when I cannot get a valid lease at all.</p>

<p>Spoke with comcast and got the run around – “reboot everything”, “remove your router”, “unplug your toaster”, “wear a little foil hat like joaquin phoenix did in Signs”. Finally they told me it is all the router’s fault (it’s been working fine for 1 year) and that I need to sign up for their home networking option.</p>

<p>So I am on hold to find out what that is. Anyone have any relevant advice?</p>

<p>UPDATE: spoke with a much better support person at Comcast. Issue has been escalated. I continue to see lease times &lt; 2 hours. And at every renewal, i am getting widely varying IP addresses (not so unusual) AND varying subnet masks – anything from 255.255.255.0 up to 255.255.255.250. that seems odd to me. I’ve switched routers to no avail, also tried routerless.</p>

I’ve often wished that I could search just a subset of the web – I’d like to give google not a single domain to scope a search, but a list of domains. Jon’s article is a great articulation of that idea in depth – the list of interesting domains he focuses on is your blogroll, but the idea could be used with other lists as well. <a href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2005/03/the_vertical_se.html">Like Tom Evslin</a>, I don’t think I believe in vertical search engines.

  <h1><a href="/2005/03/07/more-on-light-bulbs.html">More on Light Bulbs</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I got a couple questions about <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001804.html">my post on LED lightbulbs</a>. While the LED bulbs are not ready for primetime, I have had good luck with <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/diy_main/pg_diy.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1268801727.1110222142@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=cceladdedellkfdcgelceffdfgidgln.0&amp;CNTTYPE=PROD_META&amp;CNTKEY=Super%20Categories/Home%20D%E9cor%20%26%20Organizing&amp;MID=9876&amp;pos=p04">these compact fluorescents from HDb</a>. They fit a standard socket and provide a very warm light, almost a little too yellow. But certainly no hint of blue.</p>

<p>I also recently ordered from http://www.lumitroncop.com and from http://www.1000bulbs.com. I ordered compact fluorescents to replace r20s and r30s (spots), we’ll see how those work.</p>

<p>I was motivated to move to incandescent alternatives because my office at home is too hot between all the PCs and devices and lights. Now that some have worked, I am motivated to move the whole house over for the energy savings. The one application that I am stuck with incandescents is for lights on dimming circuits – fluorescents don’t like variable voltage.</p>

    <p>I need a car for about 6 months to use up on Lopez Island. You can do long term rentals at places like <a href="http://www.budget.com/bbtm/">Budget</a> but very expensive.</p>

<p>Assuming an existing lease may be the way to go – <a href="http://www.swapalease.com/">Swapalease</a> and <a href="http://www.leasetrader.com/">Leasetrader</a> both seem to have a lot of inventory.</p>

<p>I wonder if contacting some local leasing agents directly might not be the smartest thing to do – they must have some leases in default that they need someone to pick up.</p>

<p>Not ready for primetime. Light is too directional, too blue, and not bright enough. But great for places like the garage where those problems aren’t an issue.</p>
