			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I installed the <a href="http://www.cd3o.com/">cd30</a> network mp3 player today. i’ve been playing around with for an hour or so now.</p>

<p>What to like: well it is nice being able to listen to all my music at my stereo location. no more dragging cds around.</p>

<p>What not to like: the interface doesn’t work very well for a 1000+ artist collection like mine. there is no visual interface, just a remote and voice prompts. the remote permits tegic/t9 style entry of artist names and album names so you can get around ok, but there is no visual feedback at all, just voice response, so it is pretty tedious to get thru a large collection.</p>

<p>Also, I could not get the 802.11 link to work. I probably had the wrong ssid or wep settings. or actually the more i think about it, our 802.11 net is outside our firewall, while my cd30 server is inside the firewall, so i probably had firewall problems. whatever, it didn’t work.</p>

<p>Like with the hp media receiver, to get the best out of this device, i need to go author playlists explicitly for the device so that it is easy to navigate my content.</p>

<p>I just finished a reading concerning fear, certainty, and control. The basic point being there is no certainty in life, so get over your desire for it. A great quote from <a href="http://www.aap-psychosynthesis.org/Assagioli.html">Roberto Assagioli</a> in this reading – <em>“There is no certainty; there is only adventure. Even stars explode.”</em></p>

				<p><p>Halloween tip of the day – From the MoM yahoo group – Fire is usually created visually with cantalope colored orange (pale amber)and with bright pale yellow in random patterns. My suggestion would be to place the light fixture in a coffee can through the bottow with venting on the sides as too not get too warm and then gel the tops with colored gel. The plastic lid, after cutting out all of the center and leaving a half an inch of the lids outer egde and the grip , is great for a holding on the plastic sheet of gel. Gel is a plastic sheet, sold in 20” x 24” sheets for $4.99 It changes the color of your regular white light source to the color of the gel. A quick and easy way to set an entire mood in a theatrical space for a fraction of the cost of a couple of colored bulds.

<p>I remember vividly my first business trip with Jawad. We were down at 3Com. In the middle of the meeting, he excused himself, pulled his prayer mat out of a bag, oriented himself in the conference room, performed his devotions, and then rejoined the meeting. I was so impressed with this – someone who had such confidence in and commitment to their values. I have been a huge fan of Jawad’s ever since.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">01 May 2003</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I played around a lot with the <a href="http://h20015.www2.hp.com/en/document.jhtml?lc=en&amp;docName=bpz01051">HP Media Receiver</a> this week. A lot of promise but a lot of problems.</p>

<p>The Promise: Once I got the receiver playing a slideshow with pleasant background music, my family was entranced. They could have sat for a couple hours watching family photos. I could easily see this becoming a family event a couple times a month.</p>

<p>The Problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance. I have 500+ cds ripped and ~3000 photos. The device is slow to enumerate and browse the collection.</li>
  <li>UI. It just doesn’t scale to a collection this size. Browsing a big flat list of artists or albums doesn’t work. The UI needs to be better informed about my prefs based on my MRU on my PC, or based on explicit config at the PC, and needs a thumbsup/thumbsdown UI.</li>
  <li>Photos. Too many of my photos are rotated incorrectly or are too dark. The software should just autofix this.</li>
  <li>Simultaneous Music and Photo control. I never did figure out during a slideshow whether the pause (or stop or ff) button applied to the photo or the music. Sometimes it seemed to do one, sometimes the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>To take advantage of this device, I am going to end up doing some authoring on the pc side. I am going to make thematic folders of corrected pictures, and also make folders of appropriate background music. I’ll name these folders using yellow page listing tricks to force them to the top of the browse list – “AAA Summer vacation photos”.
