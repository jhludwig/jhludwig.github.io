	<title>Recent Books -- North Woods, The Demon of Unrest, Team of Rivals, Titanium Noir, Translation State, Money, Uncommon Stars, How to Know a Person, Dark Wire – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="
  North Woods by Daniel Mason. I love a carefully constructed novel.  This is great, the tale over the centuries of all the people who have inhabitated a single house, with nicely interwoven stories.
  The Demon of Unrest: A Saga of Hubris, Heartbreak, and Heroism at the Dawn of the Civil War by Erik Larson.  What a train wreck of hubris.  Ego-driven rush into conflict without any consideration of the consequences.
  Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin.  What a tragic national and personal story.  Lincoln was unique and the country was fortunate to have him, during a time of incredible tragedy and personal tragedy.
  Titanium Noir by Nick Harkaway. A pretty classic noir tale, rendered by a good author.
  Translation State by Ann Leckie.  Fun exploration of a very messy political situation.
  Money: The Unauthorized Biography by Felix Martin.  An OK walk thru the history of money.  If you haven’t thought about what money is, this is a fine start.   His prescriptions are a little thin.
  Light From Uncommon Stars by Ryka Aoki.  Quite a romp, aliens and demons and gender/sexuality issues.  Fun read.
  How to Know a Person by David Brooks.   Very provoking for me.  I have not always been good at understanding people, there are skills in here I have not begun to understand and master.
  Dark Wire by Joseph Cox. True story of how the FBI and other agencies duped the criminal world into using a phone system operated by the FBI.  A little light but still engaging.
