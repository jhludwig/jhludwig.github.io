	<title>Recent Books -- Upgrade, Infinity Gate, Dust, Tailspin, Barbarian Days, Money, System Collapse – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="
  Upgrade by Blake Crouch.  Fun bio hackign adventure, not really much new in here tho.
  Infinity Gate by M. R. Carey.  Fun multiple universe romp, a lot of interesting ideas.  I do wish the author had written a smaller story, not every book needs to be part of a universe-ending trilogy.
  Dust: The Modern World in a Trillion Particles by Jay Owens.  Interesting, infuriating, disagreeable, insightful.  I learned a lot about some ecological disasters – the Aral Sea, the Dust Bowl, etc.  I was intrigued by some of the recovery projects underway.  I was annoyed by some of the degrowth talk, an unrealistic approach.  I was confused about the tie to climate change, as the author points out that dust loads were much higher at times in prehistory, and that climate change may be largely a function of sun cycles and orbital oscillations.  Overall, intriguing.
  Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America’s Fifty-Year Fall–and Those Fighting to Reverse It by Steven Brill.  A sometimes-too-long exploration of how the middle class has declined, how the rich have gotten richer, how our political systems have failed us.  A lot of data and anecdotes.  The author is ultimately optimistic but gosh it is a rough and sad tale.
  Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life by William Finnegan.  What a great book. More detail about surfing than I ever wanted (I don’t surf), but all shared in a way that was compelling.  And man, the author’s life choices, a set of choices that I could never have imagined making, chasing after his surfing compulsion.
  Money: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing by Jacob Goldstein.  A breezy and brief history of money.  Not the deepest story but does a nice job of intuitively explaining how money is a social construct.
  System Collapse by Martha Wells.  I loved the prior murderbot books, but this one didn’t cut the mustard.  Strays away from the unique murderbot characteristics and is a generic space adventure.
