				<p><p>In order of increasing strangeness.</p>

<p>* “A confusion of princes”:amazon by Garth Nix. YA space opera, kind of reminiscent of the tales of my youth or even back to John Carter books. * “By the Blood of Heroes”:amazon by Joseph Nassise. WWI and zombies. First in a series. Acceptable but there are better zombie books. * “Immobility”:amazon by Brian Evenson. A nearly invulnerable amnesiac wakes up in a post apocalyptic wasteland and tries to deal with the remnants of humanity. Hint: no one is really his friend. * “The Sorcerer’s House”:amazon by Gene Wolfe. I last read a Wolfe book maybe 20 years ago and at that time thought “wow he is weird”. Well he still is. * “1Q84”:amazon by Haruki Murakami. Childhood sweethearts reunite after 20 years of separation. Oh and she is an assassin, he is involved in a fraud, they’re fighting against a religious cult, some very strange supernatural creatures who might be good or incredibly evil are pulling strings, there is an extra moon in the sky, soulless doppelgängers are wandering around, and other strange shit.</p>

<p>Evernote to the rescue, I created a new note on my phone and made an audio recording of the groan and rattle. Now I have it saved for ever, can play it back at will, email it to the tech, etc. Next time my car makes a funny noise I’ll use the same trick.</p>

<p>There is probably some other way to make an audio recording on my Nokia Lumia but it wasn’t obvious, and the Evernote app is simple and gets the recording to the cloud immediately.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">31 May 2012</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Some early reviews of the original Kindle were very dismissive, wondering why anyone would want to carry around a limited device with a goofy display. These tech-savvy reviewers predicted failure for Amazon, saying that people would prefer general purpose phones or tablets for reading. A lot of these reviewers were not actually heavy book readers tho.</p>

<p>Amazon has done just fine with Kindles. They focused on people who actually bought and read a lot of books. For book enthusiasts, the Kindle has been just fine, and heavy readers have no issue carrying around a device focused just on reading – it saves carrying around 4-5 books. And book enthusiasts spend a lot of money on books and can justify the expense easily. Long term, general purpose tablets may displace the hardware Kindle, but Amazon has played this well, and I suspect focused devices targeting enthusiasts will always have a place.</p>

<p>Two recent TV products are interesting – <a href="https://www.simple.tv/">Simple.TV</a> is a slick looking little box to receive and record OTA programming, won all kinds of kudos at CES. <a href="https://aereo.com/home">Aereo</a> lets you watch OTA TV anywhere on any device, with no antenna or fuss. Aereo is getting a ton of press, less about the product, more about Barry Diller and tussles with broadcasters.</p>

<p>Neither of these products focus on people who spend money on TV – TV enthusiasts. People who like TV spend lots of money on cable subs, on TV sets, on premium channels, etc. Enthusiasts don’t want to spend less, they just want it all to work well and to be a great experience. SimpleTV and Aereo both focus on people who don’t want to spend any money on TV programming, who just want OTA content, which seems strange. Like creating an ebook reader for people who don’t want to actually buy books, who only want to download public domain free books – that strategy has been tried and it has failed. At least SimpleTV lets you watch TV programming on a TV. Aereo doesn’t even connect to a TV set unless you buy something from Roku or Apple or someone else. So Aereo is for people who want to watch TV, but not on a TV, and who don’t value TV programming enough to pay for it.</p>

<p>OK that is a little snarky, obviously there is demand for cord-cutting and these products will find some success. But you’d think someone would create a product aimed at people who like TV, who spend a lot on TV, who want TV on TV sets, and who also want some of the other features of Simple and Aereo – watch anywhere on any device. <a href="http://www.nimbletv.com/">NimbleTV</a> seems like it could be more interesting.</p>

				<p><p>“Rich”:www.tongfamily.com asked me what setup I am using – here is what I have so far</p>

<p>* Zotac IONITX-S motherboard with Intel Atom D525 proc Nivida ION 512MB GPU. You can pick up at “Amazon”:http://www.amazon.com/ZOTAC-Dual-Core-Intel-Wi-Fi-Motherboard/dp/B004V3X9D2 if you want it fast or there are cheaper slower options.</p>

<p>* 4G of DDR3 800Mhz FSB RAM. This is available many places, is super cheap due to modest speed of FSB.</p>

<p>* For a case I like the “open air techstations”:http://www.highspeedpc.com/ so I can get in and out easily. But these things are completely open, so not a great choice if you have an inquisitive cat or a toddler. Another open air case option might be the “Antec Skeleton”:http://store.antec.com/Product/enclosure-skeleton_series/mini-skeleton-90/0-761345-15127-6.aspx but whoa, a 90W power supply seems seriously minimalist</p>

<p>* I can find no clear doc on what kind of power supply these need (ie watts). I picked up a “20+4 pin mini itx supply”:http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817148044 because that seems to be the right thing but I am a little concerned about being underpowered. UPDATE: in email with Zotac support, they suggested 112W for the board, sans hard disk. So throwing in the SSD and Ceton card, 250W seems like it should be fine.</p>

<p>* and the “ceton card”:http://www.amazon.com/Ceton-InfiniTV-Digital-Cable-Quad-tuner/dp/B003B4VLJQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338408276&amp;sr=1-1 for cable feed</p>

<p>* oh yeah I need an SSD, I am using the “Samsung 256G unit”:http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147164 but I’d really like a 1T SSD. But those are crazy expensive.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/nokia-lumia-900-and-lte-networks-good-and-bad">Nokia Lumia 900 and LTE networks -- good and bad</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">15 May 2012</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Ok so I’ve had a chance to use the Lumia on an LTE network for most of a week here in LA.</p>

<p>The obvious good – data services are fast, it is hard to tell you are not on WiFi. This kind of speed is addictive, it is going to suck going back to slower nets in Seattle.</p>

<p>The downside – the battery drains fast. I was also using the phone a lot for nav so I’m not sure how much of my battery drain was due to LTE and how much for nav but the phone couldn’t last a day without recharge.</p>

<p>I also had to reboot the phone twice. Once, MSFT services quit working – bing search, Msft map app. Google worked fine, Nokia maps worked fine, but everything MSFT would just hang. Reboot fixed. (btw, the Nokia Maps app is much better than the MSFT maps app).</p>

<p>Secondly, at a location with so-so LTE service, where the phone kept dropping back to lesser data services and rates, the texting app hung. I could open it but could never type in text and the phone generally was unresponsive. Reboot fixed maybe but it may recur, the phone is feeling a little wonky again right now.</p>

<p>So how am I generally feeling about the device after a month+ of use?</p>

<p>* solid physical hardware, feels good and looks nice * generally solid OS with some nice design touches * some real problems with back button behavior. Most times the back button causes you to leave an app. Sometimes it causes you to go back in an app. And if you leave an app and then click on its home screen tile, the app restarts and forgets your place. So you have to learn to hold down the back button and use the task switch interface to get back in your app. This is all a pain in the ass. The back button shouldn’t sometimes quit and other times go back in an app. And reentering an app from the home tile shouldn’t forget where you are. Super annoying. * solid 3rd party apps when they exist * pathetic marketplace of apps – marketplace design and marketplace contents both are very poor</p>

If you ever have a chance to hear his story, it is worth it.</p>

				<p><p>Today’s experience at Fry’s – I’m trying to set up a MythTV box and I need a cable splitter so that I can continue to use my normal TiVO box. And since this is all digital cable, HD quality, I need the large bandwidth splitter, not the crappy old splitters you find anywhere.</p>

<p>So of course, Fry’s has a huge selection of &lt;900Mhz coax splitters and RG59 cable, and right in the prime display area for their TV component section. All of which is useless. And a teeny number of 2G splitters hidden up the aisle. “We specialize in parts that don’t work with most cable/satellite installs and will just frustrate the hell out of you!”</p>

<p>They could cut their floorspace and staff in half if they’d just stock products that might actually work. Who exactly is served by all these crappy parts? I bet 90% of the customers who buy the old splitters return them when they realize they won’t work. Or maybe it is all a scheme to get people to pay for professional install.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">03 May 2012</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I pay a large amount to Comcast/Xfinity each month to view nearly their entire lineup (ex non-English channels) at our home. And because we pay for a Time-Warner Cable sub as a gift for a family member, I also have access to a TWC account. A lot of dollars per month.</p>

<p>I’d like to watch all this content on my iPad when I am in a room with no tv or when I am out of the house, and I don’t feel like that is an unreasonable expectation given the dollars I spend.</p>

<p>So how do I watch on the iPad? Well as a start I downloaded as many of the branded apps for various channels and distributors as I could find.</p>

<p>* Xfinity TV app. Sounds great but is not useful. Basically a super duper remote control if I am in a room with a Xfinity branded settop box. Doesn’t let me see video, doesn’t do anything if I am out of the room. And since I am mostly a TiVo house, basically not much utility here. I had hoped/expected that Xfinity would give me an iPad app that basically acted as a dvr+tv, and would let me see all my streaming xfinity content. I was wrong. * TiVo iPad app. Looks nice and for some things – remotely managing my scheduled recordings – it is fine. But for watching video? It blows. Apparently I need to have my TiVo and iPad on the same wifi network, and none of my tivos are on wifi, so I can’t watch video. * Showtime app. Performs a distributor validation, only works on AT&amp;T Uverse and Verizon networks. Seriously? I am paying a ton for Showtime access and you guys are going to squabble with Comcast and deny me this service? * HBO Go. A reasonable app. Works on Comcast and works anywhere as near as I can tell, I can watch shows anywhere. So this is great but if the world we end up in is 57 separate apps, one per channel, each with their own UI and login, that will kind of suck. Imagine if your tv had no single guide but per-channel guides which each worked differently, and then different remotes for each channel. Barf. * NBC. A decent experience. Seems to have all their recent shows, no crazy access control. Yes you have to watch ads but that is ok with me, I have to watch ads on TV too. * WatchESPN – nice when it works, but only on TWC, Verizon, Brighthouse. Another case of distributors squabbling and screwing users. * btn2go. no comcast. More distributor squabbling * CBS sports. Claims to have live seasonal NCAAFB and NCAABB content. We will see.</p>

<p>So – I get very little of my content; I am prevented from getting a lot of choices due to squabbling between various members of the distribution chain; when I do get content, it is spewed across many different apps with all kinds of different UIs, guides, control interfaces, etc.</p>

<p>The whole set of players is really underdelivering to me. Is it any wonder people just seek out torrents?</p>

				<p><p>A kind of melancholy grouping of books this week, all exploring time and mortality in different ways. I need to switch it up after these.</p>

<p>* “A Visit from the Goon Squad”:amazon by Jennifer Egan. A half dozen characters and their interplay over their lifetimes. Time wears us all down, changes us, transforms us. The structure seemed a little gimmicky but maybe ok. * “A Step from Death”:amazon by Larry Woiwode. A brutally honest meander thru the author’s life as he contemplates fatherhood and faces death. The narrative bounces paragraph by paragraph across decades, and in the hands of a lesser writer, it would be chaos. But it is excellent. And tough. * “How It All Began”:amazon by Penelope Lively. A chance mugging sets off changes through a set of interconnected lives. Along the way the characters mull over the choices in their lives, the randomness of events, and the passage of time.</p>

				<p><p>“MGoBlog”:http://mgoblog.com/content/bcs-doubts-college-football-stadium-can-host-college-football-game rips apart the rationalization from BCS leaders about hosting of college football playoff games.</p>

<p>The proposal to host these games at schools was awesome and would have created some terrific games with terrific atmospheres, college football is all about atmosphere. Moving to neutral sites blows. The BCS really thinks that a school like UM in a smaller city can’t handle the logistics of a playoff game? Have they been to a Michigan football weekend with a major opponent like OSU or ND?</p>

<p>The BCS may have valid reasons to favor neutral sites (bowl sponsors plyIng them with $), but these are not those reasons.</p>

<p>“Prismatic”:getprismatic.com, on the other hand, has been a pleasant surprise, I get much meatier links, with a lot more relevance, and doesn’t duplicate my twitter stream. Is it better than techmeme or other aggregators, I don’t know, but I am getting value out of it.</p>
