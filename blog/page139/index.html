				<p><p>Very thoughtful article on <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/10/medical_data_is.html">investing in medical data</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fifteen years ago, I indentified data businesses as good place for venture capital investing. Being located in New York, I found investing in core technology to be hard. Data businesses had similar return characteristics and there were a lot more of them in places I could get to easily.</p>

  <p>And I identified three areas that I thought were particularly interesting; financial data, marketing data, and medical data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But HIPAA has set the rules. And my experience in the marketing data world suggests that once the rules are set, the data starts to flow. The absence of rules is a bigger deterrent to data moving because nobody wants to do anything wrong. Now with the rules set, data is going to flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very thoughtful. I aspire to be this articulate about our investment thinking.</p>

I forced a rebuild of all the old pages but because of the entry export/import, all my entry numbers were different.</p>

<p>As a result, search engines are now pointing to pages that look ok but have the wrong content. Sorry. If you use the searchbox on this page here you will find the right content. Search engines will eventually catch up.</p>

If this was done in depth, allowing users to compare investment strategies and particular investments, that’d be pretty powerful. * <a href="http://www.aventureforth.com/2005/09/15/a-vcs-perspective-on-web-20/">A VC’s view of web2.0 investing</a>. Good points. Like the observation that these services can be built and trialed very inexpensively. That seems like the right first step to me – no point in investing huge gobs of time and dollars if no one cares about an initial quick implementation. * Same guy <a href="http://www.aventureforth.com/2005/09/08/video-games-the-tyranny-of-13-year-olds-and-a-7b-market/">on games investing</a> – <em>“Despite the incredible market size numbers, gaming, as a category, hasn’t produced many significant wins for venture investors. I think this will change as the underlying technology continues to improve and as people–not just kids–spend an increasing amount of time and dollars playing games.”</em></p>
