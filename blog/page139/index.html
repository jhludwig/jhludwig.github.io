    <p><strong>Buckeyes’ Physical Play</strong>. This was OSU’s key to victory in my mind – counter Miami’s speed with greater physicality. The Miami fans around us said they hadn’t seen hitting intensity like this before. It is the same level that we saw in the Michigan game. A speed advantage just doesn’t matter that much if you are getting hit constantly behind the line of scrimmage. <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/college/hurricanes/sfl-umfoot06jan06,0,7353010.story?coll=tf%2Dhurricanes">OrlandoSentinel.com: Hurricanes</a></p>

    <p><strong>Blogs and Education</strong>. I am headed up this week to <a href="http://www.forestridge.org">Forest Ridge School</a> to present blog technology to some of the teaching staff and talk about how to use the technology at the schools. Very excited to kick this effort off. I’d like to see the school embrace blogging in at least 3 ways. One, to replace their current extranet site – a great blog implementation would provide a more current and interesting site, allowing posts from the whole school community. Two, as an intranet tool for classroom discussions and other communities in the school. Three, I really want to get some students to embrace blogs. Seems like we need better blog/IM integration than is available today if we want young people to embrace – based on my observation of how much time students spend on IM. We need to think really hard about what parts of the IM experience should be persisted over to a blog, and how this should easily work.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/01/04/fiesta-bowl.html">Fiesta Bowl</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Fiesta Bowl</strong>. What an experience. The first Ohio State game ever for our kids, they will never forget it. A few highlights of our trip:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the band, as always, was amazing. the drum major was outstanding, how does anyone move a baton that way? and all-brass makes such a difference in sound.</li>
  <li>osu fans outnumbered miami fans 10 to 1. It was like a home game. The stadium was half full 90 minutes before the game, started cheering a half hour before the game, and never let up. We stood the entire game. We were on the “miami” side of the stadium, which meant that miami fans were only outnumbered about 4 to 1.</li>
  <li>the setting was beautiful. Nestled in between two hills, desert sunset, perfect temperature. Fireworks after every score. We had great seats on the 35. While the facility is dated, it was a great place to see the game, and it is kind of a shame they are moving in the future to the cardinals’ stadium.</li>
  <li>most of the miami people we met were great. Very into the game and very knowledgeable. Very respectful tho a teensy bit overconfident – but who wouldn’t be with miami’s record of success.</li>
  <li>every waiter, retail sales clerk we met claimed to be from some town in ohio. Yeah right. But I am sure it helped their tips.</li>
  <li>the overtimes were surreal. Time seemed to slow down. Each play took a half hour to play out. They are all etched in our minds. When osu was on defense the place was wild with cheering. No one panicked when miami thought they won, everyone saw the flag fly.</li>
  <li>the miami folks around us were all a little taken aback by halftime. They’ve not run into a program like ohio state. The fans, the nonstop cheering, the band, the intensity of play – it was all beyond their experience. I am guessing that the Big East just doesn’t measure up to the Big 10 in tradition, fan intensity, or intensity of play.</li>
  <li>for me, the signature plays were when clarett wrestled the ball back on the interception, and when we drove in for our touchdowns on qb sneaks. Clarett’s play just demonstrated the intensity and focus of the team – he was NOT going to let miami get away with an interception. and the touchdown plays were classic smashmouth football – everyone knew exactly what play was going to be run, it was just team against team, player against player.</li>
  <li>lastly, our thoughts are with mcgahee, we hope he recovers fully. very sad for him to get knocked out of the game with a tough looking injury.</li>
</ul>

    <p><strong>Xbox Live experience</strong>. Installed this on christmas day. Overall a fun product but some issues. Whacked is a fun social game that we’ve been playing a lot. Very easy to join up with others. The big problem is the communicator voice attachment. It seems like a great idea, and I think when you are playing with known friends it will be fun. But wow did I hear some salty language in the random games, comments that were just not appropriate.

    <p><strong>Samsung Uproar Phone.</strong> Grr. I bought this phone a couple years ago because of the included mp3 player. i haven’t used it much in the last year but i dusted it off and started using again. I wanted to load new music on it of course. A, the old software doesn’t work under XP. B, Sprint doesn’t support the phone anymore and there is no XP software on their site. C, Samsung doesn’t support the phone anymore and there is no XP software on their site. So I now have a phone that has a set of music, for all intents and purposes, welded into the phone for all time. After being introduced just a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Reinforces my determination to NEVER buy a device again that doesn’t support simple open formats and protocols. Vendors don’t maintain their proprietary crap and then you are stuck.</p>

    <p><strong>Hard Disks+Broadband vs DVDs.</strong> <a href="http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/2002/12/18.html#a262">Joshua</a> wonders why people bother with trying to burn DVDs. I had a similar experience recently. I had to get a copy of a video to someone. After capturing it from my camera, I went thru the trouble of trying to get it back on a DVD, worrying about +R/-R formats, hoping the DVD would work in their player, etc. And then had an aha moment and just jammed the video in 4-5 different encodings on my website. Worked great. Leave the DVD burning to someone who wants to screw around with DVD compat issues.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2002/12/17/shared-browsing-i-have-been.html">Shared Browsing. I have been</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><strong>Shared Browsing</strong>. I have been using the Application Sharing feature of MSN Messenger a lot recently. It is a great homework and college app tool, we can sit together and look at online apps, or at various homework searches. But there are some things I hate about it. A, it is such overkill. Tons of code loads and then the entire app window gets scraped, rendered into some protocol, and sent remotely, where a ton of code on the other machine receives and rerenders. B, it is so squirelly. All kinds of paint problems on the receiving end – Windows just doesn’t seem that happy with this crazy idea. C, the interface is absolutely unintelligible. I only understand it because, well, I used to manage the team. My kids think it is the goofiest software. I can’t even imagine explaining it to my dad.</p>

<p>I’d like a simpler, lighter-weight solution. The data I really need to pass between machines is just the URL, cookie data, and some SSL data i think. Looking for solutions on the web – <a href="http://www.ezwebcar.com/Faq.asp#Co-Browsing">ezWebCar</a> -- hmm doesn’t handle ssl, maybe for good reasons. But makes it useless for college apps. <a href="http://www.talisma.com/products/browsing.asp">Talisma</a> has a product which handles SSL but seems enterprise focused. There are other enterprise focused solutions floating around too like Wicom. Then there are classroom focused solutions like <a href="http://www.webwisdom.com/Products/vclassroom.html">webwisdom</a>. But way heavier than I need.</p>

<p>Maybe I should go lower-tech and just use a combo of <a href="http://www.42u.com/video_splitters.htm">KVM boxes and splitters</a> to share the screen. Probably would be more robust than all the software solutions.</p>

    <p><strong>Multiple PCs in the Home</strong>. Something I am starting to wonder about lately – I originally thought that the emergence of multi-PC homes would be a huge boon for Microsoft. And in the short term it is. But long term I wonder. The more PCs I have in my home, the more driven I am to get data off the PCs and get it centralized on servers. With a clean self-descriptive data format so that the data is usable from any PC. And get devices off individual PCs and get them on the net so they are usable from anywhere. And move to very lightweight apps that are easy to deploy and manage on all the PCs. And move to cheap apps since I can’t afford Office licenses for all my machines. In the long run, it seems like this will all play more to appliance vendors, to other device providers, and to alternative app providers, more than it will play to Microsoft.</p>
