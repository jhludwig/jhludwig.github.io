				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">29 May 2008</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK I’ve experienced codec hell on Windows, and while the Mac is much much better, as soon as you do something off the beaten path, well it gets complicated. I wanted to use some clips from a commercial DVD in a presentation (gasp!) and after wandering around the forums for a while, I bought the <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/mpeg2/">Apple MPEG2 codec</a> and then used <a href="http://www.squared5.com/">MPEG Clipstream</a> to rip the entire DVDs. Then I exported to Quicktime and slurped the movie into iMovie. From there I found the clips I needed, created some small projects, and then exported to several formats for PC viewing – and the target PC only has WMP and I can’t change the software load on it. MPEG4 – too much compression, looked terrible. Various QT formats – some look ok but none would play in WMP. Finally settled on AVI as the format – first used the default cinepack compressor with default settings – worked fine but too much compression! Re-cinepacked at the highest quality settings and looked/worked ok. and then redid as DV-NTSC which also looks/works good but is pretty big.</p>

<p>This would all be so much easier if Apple/MSFT could agree on some basic codec loads for their machines.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I use textile to create all my book links in the blog. as a reader pointed out, this unfortunately doesn’t link very directly to the kindle edition of books. So experimenting with textile below:</p>

<p>* “The Story of French”:amazon – this is a textile generated link just using the title * “The Story of French (Kindle)”:amazon – a text with some kindle wordage. oops doesn’t work, when you paren a word it shows up as alternate text and is not sent to amazon as part of the search string * “The Story of French – Kindle”:amazon – another kindle test. this one takes you to a search results page with Kindle edition first * “The Story of Frennch, Kindle Edition”:amazon – another kindle test. blows chunks, doesn’t find any edition of the book</p>

<p>ok so i guess pattern 3 is the best. it is too bad that pattern 2 doesn’t work.</p>

				<p><p>* “The Story of French”:amazon by Jean-Benoit Nadeau. Interesting to a casual student of language, the contrast between the active central management of French and the organic unmanaged nature of English is interesting. The strong role of Quebec, vs the weak role of France itself in advancing the language was illuminating. I also had never understood the distinction between an etymologic language like English and a phonetic language like French – no wonder English is such a pain to learn. Of course like all books about French culture, there were the requisite protestations about the relevance of French and all things French – this got old. * “The Physics of NASCAR”:amazon by Diandra Leslie-Pelecky. A little disappointing. Some interesting views into the engineering behind NASCAR vehicles but the science explanations are at the 9th grade level. I had hoped for more. * “John Adams”:amazon by David McCullough. Terrific tale of a legendary American. Moving in a way I didn’t expect. Adams thought broadly and was principled to a fault. Didn’t use his governmental career to enrich himself or his family. Endured great personal tragedy with grace. An inspiration.</p>
