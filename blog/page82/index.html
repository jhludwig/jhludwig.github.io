    <p>Testing out yet another blog posting tool – elicit from <a href="http://http//www.bingobangosoftware.com/makemoney.htm">bingobangosoftware</a>.  A very unique take on blog posting – very focused on helping semipro bloggers manage their posting rate and their affiliate income.  Easy to add affiliate links, easy to manage your stream of posts thru a calendaring interface.  I don’t know yet if I like the tool but I admire the inventiveness.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: OK on initial testing some goods and bads:</p>

<p>* Good: the scheduler worked perfectly. You can create posts for arbitrary times and they will be posted at that time. I realize there are many other tools to do this, but the outlook-like calendar interface is very nice. * So-so: doesn’t respect mt text processing plugins like textile 2 – but has a full wysiwyg editor and html editor so maybe that is ok * Bad: doesn’t seem to post keywords correctly. Wraps the entry in tags. and most strangely, enters the post body in both the entry body and extended entry fields – not helpful!!</p>

    <p>Very thoughtful article on <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/10/medical_data_is.html">investing in medical data</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fifteen years ago, I indentified data businesses as good place for venture capital investing. Being located in New York, I found investing in core technology to be hard. Data businesses had similar return characteristics and there were a lot more of them in places I could get to easily.</p>

  <p>And I identified three areas that I thought were particularly interesting; financial data, marketing data, and medical data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But HIPAA has set the rules. And my experience in the marketing data world suggests that once the rules are set, the data starts to flow. The absence of rules is a bigger deterrent to data moving because nobody wants to do anything wrong. Now with the rules set, data is going to flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very thoughtful. I aspire to be this articulate about our investment thinking.</p>
