	<title>Ignition blog round up 12/3 – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="* Nice story via Gizmodo on one of our investments, MobileLime * Rendition Networks acquired by Opsware, congrats! * Andy Sack points to a sarcastic NYTimes piece by friedman – as always a fun read. * Adrian found a nice roundup of wifobs and an incredibly valuable nokia headset adapter. * Johnza has a nice post on how to switch customers away from a competitor. Great lessons in here. Also a good post on PR around funding events. Across both these posts, I draw a great lesson – clear focus on your exact goal can always pay off. But you have to know your goal and you have to focus. * Rich as always has a cornucopia of tech posts – Yahoo Toolbar (I agree, you have to get this for the spyware tool), RockXP for PID recovery, a good set of podcasting links, his recos on must have software, the beginnings of his quest to build a htpc. how does the guy have time for a life and job?
