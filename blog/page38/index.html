    <p>* “Carnival”:amazon by Elizabeth Bear. Far future dystopias wracked apart by multilayered conspiracies. Fun story, interesting societies, good characters. * “No Time For Goodbyes”:amazon by Linwood Barclay. Great opening and a solid story overall though it never quite matches up to the evocativeness of the opening.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2008/12/27/trying-out-a-zune.html">Trying out a Zune</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK I had pretty much given up on the Zune, but the latest devices actually look nice (the small form factor ones), and now with the subscription service PLUS the keep 10 songs forever each month offer, I am compelled to try.</p>

<p>Trying to get it to work on my XP machine tho was an abject failure. The software download went fine, but there is some DRM problem, I can’t download any tracks. Did a clean install of Zune, deleted all my DRM directories, ran the resetDRM tool that Microsoft provides – dead dead dead. Filed a service request with Microsoft 36 hours ago, no response. The forums are no help. Stunningly painful experience. Tells me that the Zune team doesn’t really test on old crufty XP installs.</p>

<p>I don’t have another machine sitting around, so I decided to go for degree of difficulty points and installed VMWare Fusion on my Macbook Pro, installed Vista, and installed Zune. OK I can at least download tracks now (after massive futzing with file directory permissions on the Mac side, in the Fusion app, and in the Windows install). Plugging in the Zune, USB connectivity wasn’t flawless but good enough, if it doesn’t work for you, just keep attaching the device and eventually all will be well.</p>

<p>So now downloading the top 50 albums of 2008 per the Rolling Stone, as well as the albums listed in the WSJ this weekend. This is what I like about the Zune, the ability to try out music for basically free. That said, the install troubles on XP (and the many forum postings indicating that this is a common problem) is going to kill acceptance of the device.</p>

    <p>We always buy some board games for the Christmas period and play them in the evening. Started the practice years ago with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MayFair-Games-4102480-Settlers-Catan/dp/B000W7JWUA/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=toys-and-games&amp;qid=1230268789&amp;sr=8-1">Settlers of Catan</a> which remains the gold standard.  This year we tried:</p>

          <td>BoardGameGeek](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/34707). OK it seems like this could be a fun game and we started to enjoy it, but the game exploded into a major argument about the rules. The rulebook is not the strongest.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/31999">Tzaar</a> – fun and quick, but only two player. It is part of some series of games called <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/project_GIPF">Project GIPF</a> that interrelate in some fashion, need to learn more about</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/33154">Wasabi!</a> – some liked, some did not. The winner liked, shockingly. I thought it was fun tho I pissed everyone off by playing the Wasabi! card late in the which really put the brakes on the action.  Late in the game, gameplay really slows down as the board gets cluttered which is a problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Settlers is still the best but these were all entertaining</p>

    <p>* “Ender in Exile”:amazon by Orson Scott Card. It has been probably 20 years since I read Ender’s Game, and this new book does not stand alone. And so at first I was frustrated. But the characters remain appealing and the story deals with meaty post-war issues that are relevant to our times. * “The Reluctant Communist”:amazon by Charles Robert Jenkins with Jim Frederick. True story of a deserter who spent 40 years in North Korea. The insane self-imposed rigors of everyday life in North Korea are stunning.</p>

    <ul>
  <li>“Vacuum Diagrams”:amazon by Stephen Baxter. A pastiche of short stories, many in classic pulp style, strung together with some connective narrative to make into a somewhat interesting whole.  Diverting but ultimately kind of hollow, the main character is pretty thin.</li>
  <li>“Meat Market”:amazon by Bruce Feldman. Nonfiction, Bruce sits inside the Mississippi team for a year following primarily their recruiting travails under (now former) head coach Ed Orgeron. Life on the margins of bigtime college football is tough for the players and the teams, gives me new appreciation for coaches that are able to lift programs up from the doldrums.</li>
  <li>“Nothing To Lose”:amazon by Lee Child.  Another Reacher tale, this one is one of the weaker in the series, or maybe I am just Reachered out.  This book starts to feel like it is heading toward Stephen King territory with Apocalyptic cults which seem to have possessed whole towns.</li>
  <li>“The Watchman”:amazon by Robert Crais.  A Joe Pike thriller, this one is far more satisfying than the Reacher tale above.  Characters are more human, and thus resolution of plot is far more satisfying.</li>

    <p>* “How To Talk About Books You Haven’t Read”:amazon by Pierre Bayard. A great treatise on what the act of reading is really about – how books enter your brain, how they are retained, how they enrich you, how you connect with others about what you’ve read. If you are a thoughtful reader, this is an excellent book.</p>

<p>* “Deal Breaker”:amazon by Harlan Coben. I am not sure what it says about me that I immediately read a formulaic series thriller after the Bayard. But Coben’s books always please. This is the first in his Myron Bolitar series and as good as all the later in the series.</p>
