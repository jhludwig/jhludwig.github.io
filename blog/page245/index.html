				<p><p><strong>How Many Megapixels</strong>. So I saw yesterday that kodak is introducing a <a href="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/products/cameras/dcsPro14n/dcsPro14nIndex.jhtml?id=0.2.6.30.5.8.3&amp;lc=en">14 Megapixel camera</a> for prosumers. Wow. I remember when a guy in a camera store told me “you’ll never need more than 3 megapixels”. Yeah, just like I will never need more than 16K of RAM…</p>

<p>I started to wonder about the logical limit to megapixel growth in cameras. Will we want 100 megapixel cameras? Gigapixel cameras? Terapixel cameras?</p>

<p>Well some quick internet searching tells me that the demand for cameras in the gigapixel range will happen in our lifetime. It is pretty easy to find discussions today on the net of people needing cameras approaching 100 megapixels. For great resolution prints at 11x14, you can chew up pixels fast. I think average people will do this.</p>

<p>And bleeding edge people are talking about gigapixel cameras – for instance <a href="http://snap.lbl.gov/pubdocs/SNAP_Introduction.ppt">NASA mission planning</a> and people researching <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0208/0208013.pdf">petabyte database scaling</a> (again astronomy images).</p>

<p>Will average joes like me want to have a gigapixel camera? My guess is yes or something close to it. I am betting we will all want to eventually have digital photos with at least the resolution of today’s film. And per some discussions on various photo sites, that means we will want <a href="http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0011Yu">400Megapixel+</a> cameras for images with the resolution (pixel, color, and intensity) of film.</p>

<p>My gut says we won’t stop there but that will be a topic for a later post…</p>

				<p><p><strong>College Football</strong>. Wow what a great day for the Buckeyes. A super win over Minnesota, and losses by so many other contenders. I just did a quick pro forma recalc of the BCS polls and, if OSU/Miami/Oklahoma all move up as expected in the computer polls, and if WSU moves up as expected, it is going to be just about a dead heat between OSU and Miami for the 3rd spot. If the effect of WSU winning is greater than linear (ie it opens up the strength of schedule lead OSU has over Miami even more, or WSU moves up higher than 5 in the BCS), OSU could take the number 2 spot! On pins and needles…</p>

				<p><p><strong>Quick Halloween Report</strong>. Another great evening. At least 400 kids came by. We gave away a car trunkful of candy. Big successes: my tombstones, the floating graveyard lantern, the creepy shipping crate. Failures: my axworthy ghost quit running after a short time. My “Ben” rat crate fizzled totally – soundtrack died, door rattling motor died. My DMX remote failed so I couldn’t manually turn on the doghouse fogger, tho the automated system did just fine. I know I should relax but I am already starting to think about next year – replacement of all x10 with DMX, a better remote control option (maybe using a pda and 802.11), some pneumatic effects.</p>

Let’s just have companies publish quarterly a statement of ownership – who owns what shares; how many new options were granted in the quarter; how many grants expired or were cancelled; new stock issuances as a result of financing moves, etc. And then a clear state of EPS impacts of all this – I just want to know, as a stockholder, did I suffer unfair and unwise dilution during the quarter? This is something that companies could do today without solving the problem of how to value options. And it would be valuable.</p>

The <a href="http://www.xantech.com/mrc88/index.htm">Xantech MRC88</a> multizone audio controller, so i can centralize and control all my Halloween audio. Or maybe the <a href="http://www.anthemav.com/NewSitev2.0/AnthemProduct/AVM20/Specs/AVM20Specs.html">AVM20</a> for the same purpose. The <a href="http://www.videoxb.com/">Video xb</a> – one simple box to add on to my PCs to solve all my video capture, storage, and authoring issues. Something from <a href="http://www.azdencorp.com/home.html">Azden</a> for wireless distribution of all my Halloween audio. The <a href="http://www.hifi.com/store/category.cgi?category=search&amp;item=c188cdxx&amp;type=store">Cambridge SoundWorks Radio CD</a> to replace my noisy cheap Timex alarm/cd player. The <a href="http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&amp;prod_id=240T-Silver">Samsung 24” LCD Monitor</a> for my desk.

				<p><p><strong>BCS Rankings</strong>. I’ve been noodling over <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/2002-2003.html">these</a>. What a strange way to pick the teams to play for the championship. <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2002/1027/1451838.html">Brad Edwards</a> at ESPN does a good job digging into the mechanics of the system. I’ve been looking at Ohio State’s numbers the last two weeks and have seen some interesting things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most of the top 6 teams lost “strength of schedule” points this week. Only OSU and Georgia improved. OSU gets a double win here and for quality wins as WSU keeps winning. This is really going to come down to nonconference wins for both teams, as the rest of the way they are in conference play and their conference opponents are going to beat the lights out of each other. OSU needs WSU to continue to win.</li>
  <li>While scoring margin has been eliminated as a factor in computer polls, it clearly is still a factor for human voters, as OSU lost two positions in the AP Poll while Notre Dame climbed two positions. This cost us at least a point and maybe more with downstream effects</li>
  <li>Throwing out the worst computer ranking, it is the NY Times, Sagarin, and Colley Matrix polls that are hurting OSU the most, as they have us two positions behind Georgia. TheColley Matrix poll is out of Atlanta, so that explains that. I don’t fully understand the other polls yet.</li>

				<p><p><strong>Buckeyes.</strong> Nerve wracking win on Saturday but a win is a win. The computer polls don’t care about margin of victory tho clearly the voters do as OSU dropped two spots in the AP Poll. We need some help tho…very disappointing to watch FSU collapse against Notre Dame. Tho the vaunted Notre Dame schedule doesn’t seem so tough now as Michigan lost against, Michigan State has collapsed, Air Force lost again, and of course FSU is having an off year.</p>

				<p><p><strong>School Governance</strong>. Will be attending the PNAIS <a href="http://www.pnais.org/programs/GovConf.html">Governance Conference</a> in early November. Very interested to hear the mood of private school board members as the economy continues to struggle. And when you look at the demographics of this region, the potential market of students is flat or even shrinking a little over the next 10 years. And of course public schools are improving generally. I think we are in for greater levels of competition and greater questioning of the affordability and value of private education, which means we need to focus even more clearly on the quality of our product.</p>
