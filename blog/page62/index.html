    <p><a href="http://formulad.com/index.php" title="Formula Drift - Professional Drifting Championship">Formula Drift - Professional Drifting Championship</a> – great event. The sport is in its infancy here so you can easily get into the pits, up close to the track, meet the drivers, etc. The races are exciting although a little repetitive. They need to think about how to get more cars on the track at once, and to add some uncertainty to the event.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, attending Formula D does not contribute to good driving behaviour. The parking lot was a showcase of amateur drifting and the highway home was a sequence of race vignettes featuring a variety of souped-up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_burner">ricers</a>, including some really nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Skyline">imports</a>. I’ve been known to drive fast at times but I was background noise.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2007/07/06/how-history-is-taught-elsewhere.html">How History is taught elsewhere</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve often wished I could read a sampling of history texts used in high schools worldwide – it would be educational to see how students in different societies are programmed. For instance in the WSJ today, some of the messages that are being pushed in Russia, so different than how we teach history here: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118367568881058545.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" title="A Do-Over for Russian History? - WSJ.com">A Do-Over for Russian History? - WSJ.com</a></p>

<p>_Another teachers’ guide getting Kremlin support, meanwhile, recasts key elements of Soviet history. Dictator Josef Stalin is described as “the most successful Soviet leader ever,” for building industry and leading the country to victory in World War II. The guide explains his purges and the system of camps for political prisoners as a function of his desire to make the Soviet Union strong.</p>

<p>Mr. Putin himself echoed that view at the meeting with teachers, saying Stalin’s “Great Terror” of 1937 – during which at least 700,000 people were executed – wasn’t as bad as atrocities other nations had perpetrated, such as the U.S. use of the atomic bomb._</p>

    <p>Only one keeper here.</p>

<p>* “Legions of space”:amazon by Keith Laumer. Some of that old time science fiction: manly men slashing their way thru space and claiming the universe as their own. Interesting as a nostalgia piece, not sure I’d pick it up otherwise. * “Simple genius”:amazon by David Baldacci. A really crappy potboiler. My buddy Tim warned me. Sorry I spent the 2 days on it. * “Counting heads”:amazon by David Marusek. Nano-infused future society tale. Tugged at some interesting character issues but didn’t really dig into them. The ending was a little predictable as the story devolved into a typical adventure tale. * “Blindsight”:amazon by Peter Watts. Wow! A head spinning first encounter tale with a deep exploration of alienness and sentience. A deeply alien structure is encountered, and humanity sends the most extreme representatives of humanity to grapple with the situation under the theory that it takes an alien to understand one. An ambiguous, atypical, and probably unhappy ending.</p>
