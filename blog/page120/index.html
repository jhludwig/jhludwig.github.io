I just don’t see the value, in 2006, of teaching first the classical bonding models and then much later reexamining from a quantum perspective. The classical models just seem brain-damaging to me. Learning things like “The formal charge on an atom in a Lewis diagram is simple to calculate…it would have a postive charge equal to its group number…from this positive charge, subtract the number of lone-pair valence electrons…and then subtract one half of the number of bonding electrons…” is just painful, it just seems like black magic alchemy when it isn’t founded on a deeper understanding of the underlying behaviour. Oh well.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">04 October 2006</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>UPDATE 11/6/06: I’ll leave the original entry below for history but Alienware finally worked this out with me. I received a full refund. So at the end of the day they were reasonable. I have to credit Amex with assistance, I am sure that raising a dispute via them helped to resolve things. Original entry follows.</p>

<p>-————————————————————</p>

<p>Why? Because I ordered an Alienware box in July, it arrived broken in August, and it is now October and I have yet to see the fixed box returned to me. I have moved on to trying to get my money back. I have contacted support via phone and email so many times I’ve lost count, and all I get is handwaving.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.badsoftware.com/alienwaresucks/" title="Alienware Sucks!">Alienware Sucks!</a> – the classic with a complete guide to providing pressure on recalcitrant merchants. Even merits a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cem_Kaner">small WIkipedia mention</a> * <a href="http://alienwares-cks.blogspot.com/">Another guy</a> who managed to get a refund * some guy has <a href="http://www.fortsmithgamers.com/tshirts.htm">created a t-shirt</a> immortalizing the sentiment * <a href="http://www.computergripes.com/alienware.html">another set of gripes</a> * plenty of forum posts about unhappy alienware users – <a href="http://laptopmag.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=648&amp;PN=1">for instance</a>, <a href="http://www.opentechsupport.net/forums/archive/topic/13912-1.html">or here</a> * <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com/seller1650.html">Reseller ratings</a> which shows a lot of dissatisfaction, and dropping overall scores</p>

<p>Personally I am contacting American Express in an attempt to get my money back, I am sending mail to Alienware daily. I’ve given up on phone support as you will a) spend a lot of time on hold, b) have to reeducate someone new each day (Groundhog Day), and c) learn that they don’t know what is going on and can’t find anyone to help you.</p>

<p>EAST LANSING, MI–Michigan State Coach John L. Smith was unable to finish a pastrami on rye sandwich at Side Streets Deli today, citing the overly generous portions of lunchmeat on the sandwich and the “really thick bread” it was served on.</p>

<p>“It was just too much for me,” said Smith, packing the remaining half of the sandwich into wax paper sheepishly. “All that meat and bread. I felt pretty confident going into the second piece, but one bite and I was finished. They really pile on the meat at that place, I tell you.”</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>J pointed out to me there is a book about “Charlie Weis and Notre Dame’s Rise to Glory” which seems a little odd, since you generally need to both achieve glory and rise to have a “Rise to Glory”. I decided to do a little amazon sleuthing to compare Charlie with some other coaches who just maybe have a greater claim to a “rise to glory” given that they have won national championships – Tressel, Carr, Stoops, Carrol, Paterno. I’m looking for books with the coach’s name in the title, or where he gets an authoring credit of some form:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=br_ss_hs/002-9263046-5070411?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dblended&amp;keywords=charlie weis&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" title="Amazon.com: charlie weis">Amazon.com: charlie weis</a>. Sure enough, we have “The New Gold Standard: Charlie Weis and Notre Dame’s Rise to Glory”:amazon written by some 3rd party. And we have “Echoes of Notre Dame Football: The Greatest Stories Ever Told (Echoes of)”:amazon with a foreword by the Super Genius himself. But most damningly, we have “No Excuses: One Man’s Incredible Rise Through the NFL to Head Coach of Notre Dame”:amazon coauthored by “one of football’s greatest minds who has helped shape today’s game” – if you think today’s game is all about pillow soft defenses I guess. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-9263046-5070411?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=jim+tressel&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Jim Tressel</a> – just one book – “What It Means to Be a Buckeye: Jim Tressel and Ohio State’s Greatest Players”:amazon. Jim writes a foreword here, the book is not about him though. Kind of akin to the 2nd book in the Weis listings, the least self-aggrandizing title. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-9263046-5070411?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=lloyd+carr&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">LLoyd Carr</a>. Nada. Apparently people in Michigan can’t write. Or read. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-9263046-5070411?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=bob+stoops&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Bob Stoops</a>. Two titles, the obligatory “What It Means To Be A Sooner: Barry Switzer, Bob Stoops And Oklahoma’s Greatest Players (What It Means)”:amazon and “Heir to the Sooner Legacy: The Championship Story of Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops”:amazon written by some 3rd party. Apparently people in Oklahoma are doubly infinitely more literate than people in Michigan. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/002-9263046-5070411?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=pete+carroll&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Pete Carroll</a>. No “what it means to be a trojan” title, just a 3rd party championship season “Conquest: Pete Carroll And The Trojans’ Climb To The Top Of The College Football Mountain”:amazon title. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=br_ss_hs/002-9263046-5070411?platform=gurupa&amp;url=index%3Dblended&amp;keywords=joe+paterno&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go">Joe Paterno</a>. You don’t coach longer than Stoops and Tressel have been alive without getting a truckload of books written about you. Deservedly so. Some authored by him, most not. If I were to buy one, it would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quotable-Joe-L-B-Thalman/dp/0966877446/sr=8-7/qid=1159289414/ref=pd_bbs_7/002-9263046-5070411?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Quotable Joe</a></p>

<p>So I’d have to say – Paterno is the clear accomplishment winner – great accomplishments, long career, many books. Stoops, Tressel, Carroll all seem to be right in line with their accomplishments. Carr needs a better PR firm. And Weis wins the pompous bombast title – maybe he should be coaching defense instead of writing a fricking book.</p>

				<p><p>Last book posting for a little while…I am heads down on a lot of other things and probably won’t get a lot of books read for a while.</p>

<p>* “Three Days To Never”:amazon by Tim Powers. If you’ve never read Powers before, this is a good place to start. Good characters, the typical Powers scenario of magic and evil just under the surface of our rational world. If you have read Powers before, I’m not sure this will add anything to your life. * “Gone for Good”:amazon by Harlan Coben. A decent twisty coben mystery. Won’t stick to your ribs but a good beach/airplane book. * “The Enemy”:amazon by Lee Child. Another great reacher story. Earlier in his career. I think I like the later career stories better. * “The Man Who Stayed Behind”:amazon by Rittenberg. Very engaging memoir by someone who lived thru some of the most dramatic events of the 20th century. You can really feel the revolutionary fervor of mao’s china. On reflection it seems amazing how well the america revolution ended up – the quick settling into a durable democratic structure is quite a different than what china went thru or what france went thru. * “Frameshift”:amazon by Robert Sawyer. been on the shelf forever. a decent medical mystery with better-than-average characters who you can really care about.</p>

<p>On other book fronts:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FeldThoughts/~3/23294755/001945.html">Brad Feld’s vacation book list.</a> Probably some gems in here * This <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2006/08/08/692649.aspx">Collecterz</a> thingy might be worth trying. I couldn’t get their site to accept any credit cards tho, all my banks rejected the charges. Oh well.</p>
