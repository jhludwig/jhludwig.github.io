I would switch to a mailsystem today that had a stronger notion and in fact I am evaluating all kinds of solutions currently.</p>

<p>Update: Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha. So I decided to start acting on my words and I thought I’d get a certificate so I could start signing all my email sent from Outlook. I clicked on the link in Outlook to get a certificate and I was take to <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/marketplace/PortalProviderPreview.aspx?AssetID=EY010504891033&amp;CTT=6&amp;Origin=EC010272491033&amp;&amp;helplcid=1033">this page</a> – my guess is that NO ONE tries to get certificates for Outlook based on this.</p>

    <p>I need a cheap longdistance solution for calls within the US. The calling location is deep inside a building at <a href="http://www.pomona.edu">Pomona College</a> and cell coverage sucks.</p>

<p>Option A is prepaid cards. Genuine ATT cards are availabe on <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?query=at%26t+phone+cards&amp;ht=1&amp;sosortproperty=1&amp;from=R10&amp;BasicSearch=">ebay</a> for about 3.4 cents per minute. Or you can go even cheaper if you go to a site like <a href="http://www.callingcardplus.com">CallingCardPlus</a> -- rates down to .5 cents per minute. I am sure quality on some of these cheap plans is iffy.</p>

<p>The location does have 10mbit ethernet and so VOIP is an option – I wonder what will happen when every student starts using VOIP, I bet the campus net is not engineered for that case. <a href="http://www.pulver.com/fwd/" title="Free World Dialup - by pulver.com">Free World Dialup - by pulver.com</a> is a way to start, seems pretty geeky tho, you have to be a NAT expert – OK for me but not sure this will work for the caller. I wonder if <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> is any easier to use. I definitely want an option that uses a SIP phone or a regular phone, I don’t want to use a PC mic and headphones.</p>

Poor sportsmanship – a lot of unnecessary personal fouls, Tressel should have sat Will Smith the rest of the game for some of the fouls he committed. The line was pushed around aby SDSU. SDSU had a good game plan with delays and traps and draws, OSU looked confused and outhit. Krenzel was incredibly ineffective. Way off on passes, especially anything longer than 10 yards. The running game was weak.</p>

<p>The defense finally stood up and saved the day, forcing turnovers and bottling up SDSU. The offense never did show up – no one on offense should earn a leaf for their helments this week.</p>

<p>Were the buckeyes looked ahead to NC State? Not as much as NC State was looking ahead to the Buckeyes, as NC State dropped their game to Wake Forest.</p>

<p>Let’s hope Tressel and the team use this to motivate themselves for next week.</p>

I knew little about the service academies before reading this book, it is a fascinating read. At times I was impressed with West Point; the values that they try to embed in their students are very admirable. At other moments I worried about the end product, as the students seem to be dehumanized and in some ways lose respect for the rest of citizens of their nation. But a great read, very enjoyable, very engaging as it follows the careers and choices of a set of students.</p>

I am on average a centrist with a slight tip to the right on economic issues, but I love this book. The far right creeps me out and I love to see Al whack them. This book is basically a hatchet job on the far right press, Fox Network and its ilk. Very funny. There is no real issue examination in the book, Al can be just as self-righteous as the far right, but he does a great job exposing their worst behaviours. Fox was stupid to sue Al, they just gave the book press and a huge sales impetus (It’s number one on Amazon right now), so even more people are going to see Fox reporters and newscasters exposed. Al is not the guy to do this – I’d love to see someone do a serious investigation of why Fox News and its ilk are so popular and successful right now. I just don’t watch it but obviously a lot of people do.</p>

Their report: a beautiful night. Same weather and lighting as the Fiesta Bowl, felt like a continuation. The 900+ member band and alumni band was awesome. The entire game felt like a coronation, it was the first real public showing of the team since the Fiesta Bowl and the crowd was emotional. Maurice Clarett was very active in the first half, jumping up and down on the sideline right behind Tressell. He was more sedate in the second half, almost as if he was told to cool it.</p>

<p>On offense, Krenzel had a typical Krenzel game – great leadership, good field vision, good movement, great contribution on the ground. But he missed receivers a lot, he got a lot of opportunities in this game, but he wasn’t sharp delivering the ball. The receiver corp seems broad and deep (Childress made some nice catches), if Krenzel was a little sharper the score would have been much more impressive. The rushing game was fine tho not explosive. Hall and Ross looked better as the game went on – thanks to fresh legs from their rotation, and a dominating offensive line. The drive in the middle of the third quarter was just outstanding – OSU at its best – a patient mix of short passes and runs, nothing tricky, but it just wore UW out.</p>

<p>The defense was stifling. Big hits. Pickett was on his back many times, the UW receivers couldn’t get near the ball without getting crushed – Salley just about took himself out of the game with a crushing hit in the 3rd. And when they had to – after a fumble – the defense really poured it on – WIll Smith delivered a stiflign sack in the 4th to end the last meaningful UW threat. The line and linebacker corp seem awesome – the best quote of the game was about LB Simon Fraser, about whom the announcer said “he is so big, they named a university in Canada after him.”</p>

<p>Special teams were good. Sanders seems like a fine punter, nicely replacing Scott Grooms from last year. A field goal block. One unfortunate fumble trying to do too much on a return – the elimination of the halo rule this year really does have an impact, we are going to see a lot more turnovers on punts.</p>

<p>Coaching seemed quietly good. The game plan didn’t give away much, Tressell realizes that there is no point showing off your whole arsenal if you don’t need to. The team was clearly ready for the game, tho they seemed to play at 3/4 speed at times – for this game, that was fine, but it won’t work in the Big 10. The team has time to step it up.</p>

<p>For UW, well this was a tough game to open up a new coaching tenure. The Huskies still lack any kind of running threat. Pickett’s Heisman dreams certainly weren’t helped, he will have to step it up against future opponents. I hope Gilbertson is better than he looks – he looked overmatched, confused, and out of shape out there.</p>

<p>Finally, the broadcast booth. Keith Jackson? First he retired and got a big sendoff. Then he came back, but just for west coast games. Ohio Stadium is a loooong way from the west coast. I like the guy well enough, but I want back that retirement gift I sent him. :)</p>

    <p>I agree with Phil and his friends – <a href="http://www.windley.com/2003/08/29.html#a796" title="Windley's Enterprise Computing Weblog">Windley’s Enterprise Computing Weblog</a> – the flood of truly egregious spam is moving people past caring about privacy issues and big brother issues. They want the spam problem solved and if they have to give up something they will. But at the same time users are drowning in IT complexity. the first company that creates an easy to use secure mail system will capture a lot of users, even if they sacrifice privacy or other features.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/08/29/letter-from-ohio-state-ad-andy-geiger.html">Letter from Ohio State AD Andy Geiger</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Letter from <a href="http://ohiostatebuckeyes.ocsn.com/" title="OhioStateBuckeyes.com : The Official Web Site of Ohio State Athletics">OhioState AD Andy Geiger</a> received today, probably sent to the entire alumni association:</p>

<p>Dear Ohio State Football Fan,</p>

<p>Will any of us ever forget the thrills of the 2002 Football Season and the Buckeyes’ triumphant journey to the Fiesta Bowl and the National Championship? An unprecedented fourteen victories. Thrillingly close games. Individual and collective heroics that carried Ohio State to the very top of college football. Most of all, I treasure the sportsmanship, teamwork, and integrity our team demonstrated along the path to success.</p>

<p>Regrettably, other aspects of last season won’t soon be forgotten either. All season, we witnessed and received letters, email, and phone calls telling us of the vulgarity, rudeness, poor sportsmanship – even vandalism – exhibited by some Ohio State “fans.” These people chose a most unfortunate way of “supporting” our team – with a lack of respect for our opponents, for fellow Buckeye fans, and for themselves. They spoiled the day for many.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we live in a time when the put-down, trash-talking and humiliation have become part of the entertainment and sports culture. This is not the Ohio State way. Not now, not in the past, and certainly not in the future.</p>

<p>Our student-athletes are expected to be role models as representatives of The Ohio State University and I support this notion. However, I believe <em>everyone</em> associated with the University has the same responsibility to make a positive presentation to this community, and to our visitors, any time we host an event.</p>

<p>This season, I am asking for your help. Please let us know of any incidents you witness – or any indignities you suffer personally – either at Ohio Stadium or at an away game. Help us identify those who inflect their poor behaviour on others. Our Department of Athletics has adopted six fundamental values that our coaches, student-athletes, and support staff strive to live by. They are: Education, Integrity, Excellence, Innovation, Respect for the Individual, Leadership.</p>

<p>I urge you, as a member of the Ohio State community, to embrace these core values. You will contribute to making The Ohio State University the very best in everything we do. And, you will help us make our events friendly, wholesome and welcoming for our opponents, their fans, and of course our own Buckeye family.</p>

<p>Cheer heartily for our Buckeyes. Rejoice in the essence of intercollegiate athletics, which allows us to send our sons and daughters into competition with their sons and daughters. But, remember that the great rivalries we enjoy in the Big Ten are built upon a tradition of trust and cooperation. This, tos is worthy of celebration!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Andy Geiger<br />
Director of Athletics</p>

<p><strong>My take:</strong> It is great that the University sent this out. It is a fine first step, and the fact that it did not come bundled with an appeal for money gives it more weight. I hope the University sends this message out 4-5 more times during the season, repetition will help.</p>
