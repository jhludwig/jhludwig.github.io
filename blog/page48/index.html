				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/servicing-my-college-football-addiction">Servicing my college football addiction</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">30 August 2010</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Finally, the first week of college football. And the first week of servicing my addiction. Here is the plan for this year:</p>

<p>* <strong>In person attendance at games</strong>: We’ll make the November Penn State and Michigan games at Ohio Stadium. 4 tickets to each game at $70/pop comes to $560, we are able to easily sell the unused portion of our season ticket books. Oh of course to get the rights to buy 4 tickets and a parking pass, we had to join the “Buckeye Club”:http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&amp;ATCLID=1398165 at the appropriate level, and make ongoing scholarship donations which qualify us to join the “President’s Club”:http://giveto.osu.edu/donorsocieties/presidentsclub/index.html. But we will pretend those aren’t related – in fact we would donate the scholarship money anyway, to help Marion County students with demonstrated need make it through Ohio State. Oh and we will ignore the travel expense to Ohio as well, since we are going to be there primarily to visit family. Oh and I may sneak to a USC or UW game in addition but we will see. And depending on how the Buckeyes do, we may go the bowl game, count on another $2500 for tickets/travel/accommodations in Glendale (hey, go big or go home!).</p>

<p>* <strong>Watching all other weekends on TV</strong>: Sports, and particularly college football, are at least 50% of the driver for our cable/dish subscriptions. We subscribe to enough of a tier on cable to get ESPN, Fox Sports, and the Big-10 network in HD. And since we are splitting time between Seattle and Ohio this fall, we have to maintain subscriptions in both locations since cable and dish subscriptions are not portable. We’ve tried a variety of ways to get around this, but there are no quality solutions – ESPN3 is low quality, the various pirated feeds are even worse, slingbox doesn’t really work for HD content. So say half a cable bill monthly in two locations is attributable to football, that is $50/month * 2 locations * 6 months == $600.</p>

<p>* <strong>Tracking on the PC/iPad</strong>. When I’m at home watching game A, I want to track other games on a medium sized screen. ESPN, ESPN3, and SI are the best of a bad lot – all crammed with ads, tend to have load issues on Saturdays, tend to lag the real action, etc etc. I used to use Sportsline but investment in that site seems to be trending down. I’m not going to allocate any of our internet costs to sports, we would have the same connection if sports didn’t exist.</p>

<p>* <strong>Tracking on the iPhone</strong>. A real weak spot. The ESPN app is the best score tracker – customizable for just my teams, reasonable UI. But massive load issues on Saturdays, something has clearly been engineered poorly in the transaction model for this app, since it is way more load-sensitive than the web site which makes no sense at all. Backup are the websites for SI and ESPN. Twitter also critical since every major sportswriter/sportsblogger is active on twitter. Of course everyone of these data services fails totally when at a live game, as 100K people all try to hit the same cell tower at once. Google SMS is the fallback of last resort, it can sometimes work when the 3G/Edge networks are failing. You can certainly allocate half my cell phone data plan to sports for the 6 months of college football, so let’s say another $300. Yes I would look harder at a different data plan if I didn’t track sports. Overall the lack of a great app to track sports teams on the iPhone is a little surprising.</p>

<p>OK so $3100 in costs to attend games and bowl, $900 in telecom costs, so $4K in direct costs a year to watch college football. Plus the opportunity cost of time – at least 16 weekends, 8 hours of time, 128 hours. And I am probably not being honest with myself about that time commitment. But eternally hopeful that the Buckeyes will win the national championship, thereby justifying all of it!</p>

<p>Getting ready for the season:</p>

<p>* “Live odds”:http://www.bangthebook.com/football-betting/live-football-odds.php. Not that I bet, nor do I believe that odds have much to do with expected outcomes, but still interesting to peruse. * “CFB stats”:http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/ – awesome site with comprehensive stats. For when you need to spew them at someone to prove your school is better. * “Senator Tressel held in high regard by coaching ranks”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/collegesports/2012722914_survey29.html?syndication=rss. Pretty awesome. * “Blogpoll”:http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/rankings/college-football-blogpoll-top-25.</p>

				<p><p>* “Against a Dark Background”:amazon by Iain M. Banks. Banks has a unique and entertaining voice, in his universe advanced technology is just a little perverse and contrary and darkly witty. Fun read although a little long. Amazon says 4.5 stars, Goodreads 3.8, I would definitely comtimnue to read more Banks. * “Ancestor”:amazon by Scott Sigler. 4.5 stars on Amazon, 4.1 on Goodreads, but utter crap. Derivative Crichtonesque garbage with 1D cartoon characters. Not finishable. * “Ariel”:amazon by Steven R. Boyett. Terribly inconsistent tale of a young man and a unicorn in a post-apocalyptic world, but something endearing about the protagonist and his trials. 4 stars on Amazon, 3.53 on Goodreads. 3-3.5 seems about right, a good tale wrapped up in a kind of a sloppy book. * “The Company”:amazon by K. J. Parker. Odd parable of a group of veterans in a vaguely Nordic country who come together years after a war. Their lives have come to be defined by their wartime experiences and their personal forms of cowardice and betrayal. Amazon says 3.5 stars, Goodreads says 3.2. I can’t highly recommend the book but it was interesting enough to finish.</p>

<p>Wow this is an underwhelming list to end the summer on.</p>

<p>* “Haunt Toys”:http://www.haunttoys.com/ – Kurt’s first four posts are great items that I have used and loved. A webshooter and a good lightning controller are critical. The i-zombie lightning controllers have been rock-solid for me. * “The Skull Shoppe”:http://www.skullshoppe.com/ via “Grimvisions”:http://www.grimvisions.com/products/the-skull-shoppe. Kind of pricey but great looking skulls. * “Style Your Garage”:http://www.style-your-garage.com/. OK none of these really have a great Halloween theme but the idea is awesome and maybe I could craft something up for Halloween. * “Lightform”:http://www.grote.com/LightForm/ sheet LED lighting. Has to be good for something. * “Pumpkin Carving”:http://tangleofwires.blogspot.com/2010/07/pumpkin-carving-nice.html from Scott. Man these are impressive. My pumpkins suck. * “Rear-lit Book”:http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20100708/book-lamp-lights-unused-books/. A nice idea that could look nice in a halloween scene. * “LED eyeballs”:http://shop.minispotlight.com/category.sc?categoryId=9. Must have.</p>

				<p><p>It’s been 8-9 months since I last surveyed what I’m using on my iPhone.</p>

<p>On the first screen,</p>

<p>* the bottom bar is still Mail/Messages/Calendar/Safari, I use each of these apps countless times during the day. Calendar is probably the least deserving. The ios4 Mail app is a tremendous improvement over prior versions, thanks to the merging of my 4 inboxes into 1. * the stock Weather/Stocks/Maps/Camera/Calculator/Clock/Phone apps are all there. I don’t love any of these, they all have problems. Why do I have to enter cities in Weather and Clock? Why can’t Stocks show portfolio information? The Maps app hasn’t changed in forever, why can’t it import map settings from my laptop (ChromeToPhone sounds awesome). I have tried to find other stock apps but they all kind of blow. * the Settings app remains on the first page mostly so I can force Wifi on/off and force 3g on/off as i transition between various locations. Why isn’t the settings app just a folder now? * Echofon for twitter use and Byline for RSS readings make the first page. I am sure there are other fine choices in these spaces but these work well for me. * Evernote is on the first page and I am a total convert. I use this for all kinds of info, every day. And I am now trying to use it for my todo list management, tho the inability to enter todo items on the iphone sucks, hence my current trial of… * Egretlist. Which basically exposes all todo items in Evernote. The UI is horrendous – garish, amateurish. But functional. * Lose it! for calorie tracking tho my usage has fallen off (and my waist line shows it!) * 2 Across for NYTimes crosswards. There are newer and more uptodate alternatives but this one is solid. * and finally a Travel folder with TripIt, KAYAK, Southwest, Flight update as the key elements. Yelp, Urbanspoon, Topo Maps, Google Earth, OneBusAway, Point Inside, Zagat, Trip Journal also take spots in there tho I am not committed to any of them.</p>

<p>With football season approaching, some score app will fight back to the top screen – the ESPN sportscenter app or one of the other competitors, I will have to try them all. The ESPN app is fine tho it sometimes grinds to a halt on busy days.</p>

<p>On secondary screens, the other apps that get some use – Facebook, the App Store, Amazon.com, Starbucks Mobile Card, tideApp, Goodreads, Soundhound.</p>

				<p><p>* “Breathless”:amazon by Dean Koontz. A pleasant little romp about the arrival/evolution of a new species on Earth. Some intrigue, some danger, more questions than answers. “Goodreads”:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6327770-breathless gives it a 3.15, Amazon says just 2.5 stars, but I think it is more pleasant than that, I’d say 3. * “Cloud Atlas”:amazon by David Mitchell. An intricately interwoven set of adventures across hundreds of years, all shining a light on unchecked greed and ambition and injustice. Very nicely done, the structure is unusual and engaging. Amazon says 4.5 stars, “Goodreads”:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49628.Cloud_Atlas says 4.2, I give it 5 stars. * “Running Blind”:amazon by Lee Child. An early tale in the Reacher series. Ok tho not great, the central mystery was telegraphed. Amazon says 3.5 stars, “GoodReads”:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455925.Running_Blind says 4.0, I am stuck at about 3 stars. * “Die Trying”:amazon by Lee Child. Another early Reacher. Solid but that is all. “Goodreads”:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220969.Die_Trying says 3.96, Amazon says 4 stars, I’d just say 3. * “Persuader”:amazon by Lee Child. 3 Reacher tales in a month might be a bit much, the misogyny is a little overwhelming. Actually maybe just misanthropy. Whatever. Amazon says 4 stars, “Goodreads”:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455941.Persuader says nearly 4, again I’d just say 3 stars. I am obviously Reacher’d out. * “Bad Things Happen”:amazon by Harry Dolan. Very very very nicely written tale of authors and ambition and murder. The protagonist is an editor of murder tales, and the parallel between his own work process and the evolution of the story is a nice effect. Best read of the summer, amazon says 4.5 stars, it is better than that – 5 stars.</p>

				<!-- <p><p>* “Breathless”:amazon by Dean Koontz. A pleasant little romp about the arrival/evolution of a new species on Earth. Some intrigue, some danger, more questions than answers. “Goodreads”:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6327770-breathless gives it a 3.15, Amazon says just 2.5 stars, but I think it is more pleasant than that, I’d say 3. * “Cloud Atlas”:amazon by David Mitchell. An intricately interwoven set of adventures across hundreds of years, all shining a light on unchecked greed and ambition and injustice. Very nicely done, the structure is unusual and engaging. Amazon says 4.5 stars, “Goodreads”:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49628.Cloud_Atlas says 4.2, I give it 5 stars. * “Running Blind”:amazon by Lee Child. An early tale in the Reacher series.

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">01 August 2010</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Wow, August is upon us, only 4.5 weeks to “OSU’s kickoff with Marshall”:http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2010/08/01/cfbx01-gi89c2m8-1.html?sid=101.</p>

<p>Super excited about the prospects for this year’s OSU team. An experienced offensive backfield and line, a beastly-looking defensive line, and great talent in most other areas. A gnarly in-conference road schedule tho and a strengthening Big-10 conference will make it a tough year tho. Around the nation, I’m also keyed up for the Nebraska-Texas game, I’d love the see the newest member of the Big-10 wax Texas. And I’ll have my eyes on USC, I think they could do very well in a so-so Pac-10. I’ll probably watch some Washington games tho I have never bonded with the team.</p>

<p>As of this moment, I’ll be attending the OSU November home games, Penn State and Michigan. And depending on the season, potentially the bowl game. I might attend a UW game. I wish I could get back to Columbus for the Miami game or to Iowa City or Madison for the big road games but not likely to happen.</p>

<p>Go Bucks!</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>* “The Arabs: A History”:amazon by Eugene Rogan. Sweeping history of Arab nations over the last 1000 years. Conflict with the West is an ever-present theme, but a bigger theme is internal divisions and violent self-destruction within the Arab and Middle Eastern nations. At the first opportunity, people seem to pick up weapons in this part of the world to resolve their differences. Amazon says 3.5 stars, “Goodreads”:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4100352-the-arabs says 4.6 which is very high. A solid book and worth the time. * “Gandhi An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth”:amazon by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. What an inspiration. If every public servant had Gandhi’s commitment to the truth, if every revolutionary had his commitment to nonviolent noncooperation, the world would be a better place. The Middle East needs Gandhi-like leaders! Amazon says 4.5 stars, “Goodreads”:http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112803.An_Autobiography_or_The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth 4.06. Not the best writing in the world but great to read the man’s thoughts directly. * “The Light in the Tunnel”:amazon by Martin Ford. Sloppy lazy singularity crap. Thankfully brief tho I couldn’t stomach actually finishing it. Amazon says 4.5 stars, these people need to think harder. Goodreads says 1 star but then I am the only rater on Goodreads so a little circular. If you really want to read singularity crud, go read Kurzweil or Wolfram, at least those guys have put some effort into their arguments.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">10 July 2010</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>We have a dock on Lopez Island. It is old and falling apart due to years of rough weather. It is fully permitted by all state, local, and federal agencies. We want to replace it with exactly the same structure or something more eco-friendly of exactly the same size. It has been in place for more than 40 years.</p>

<p>We are on round 7? 8? of discussions with the various permitting agencies (and there are a lot – San Juan county, Army Corps of Engineers, Washington DNR, National Marine Fisheries Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and several more I am sure I forgot). We are employing an architect, a dock design/construction firm, a permit expeditor, a biological survey firm.</p>

<p>Currently we have to come up with a pile driving plan. Any kind of pile driver disturbs some form of wildlife. If we use a vibratory pile driver, we have to figure out the 120db attenuation distance for the sound, and then come up with a marine mammal (killer whales and stellar sea lions) monitoring plan. If we use a impact hammer pile driver, we have to determine the 150db attenuation distance for the sound, and then come up with a marbled murrelet (which look “darn cute”:http://www.google.com/images?q=marbled%20murrelet&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi but I’ve never seen one) monitoring plan. Oh and of course our construction window is very limited to avoid disturbing the eagle nesting season. And we’ve already cleared the fisheries and seabed vegetation hurdles (tho they could always rise back up!)</p>

<p>This is not an exercise for the faint of heart or for the budget-conscious. You have to be committed!</p>

				<p><p>Reardon abused me (not really) for still using Matlab and goaded me to look into the ImageJ world. So I am learning. Seems like I need to get smart on</p>

<p>* “ImageJ”:http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ and the “Fiji”:http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page distribution * Python derivatives like “Jython”:http://www.jython.org/ for ImageJ scripting and “NumPy/SciPy”:http://numpy.scipy.org/ for numeric/array processing * There are a ton of other scripting language choices but seems like python covers this well enough. I don’t want the brain damage of “Clojure”:http://clojure.org/.</p>

<p>Other stuff to learn? I’ll have to pick up an editor and source management tool as well. The benefit of all this? Any code I write should be faster, more easily redistributable, and there is a large support community. The disadvantage? I have to assemble all these piece-parts to get something equivalent to MatLab, so more time d&amp;*king around with software which is time taken away from research focus. And the Matlab universe has a pretty good support community too, so not clear I am trading up there. Certainly the ImageJ/Jython/NumPy path is “cooler” along a certain dimension, but do I care?</p>

But visually very funky. Ended up nuking. * “PopCharX”:http://www.ergonis.com/products/popcharx/. This is one utility I can’t live without, and the new version with favorites is nice.</p>

<p>Software I haven’t tried but need to:</p>

<p>* “Things”:http://db.tidbits.com/article/11389?rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+tidbits_main+%28TidBITS%3A+Mac+News+for+the+Rest+of+Us%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader. So frustrated with todo lists on the iphone. I want something that syncs via the cloud with outlook, ical, and has a nice iphone app. * “Panic Transmit”:https://www.panic.com/transmit/. I am pretty happy with Filezilla but Transmit gets super raves. * “Lightroom”:http://thomashawk.com/2010/06/adobe-lightroom-3-i-feel-the-need-for-speed-oh-and-the-most-significant-advancement-in-photo-noise-reduction-i-have-ever-seen.html. I’ve been happy with Aperture and I hate the huge morass of software that Adobe foists on you when you install their apps, but I feel like I’m missing the Lightroom party. * “Trip Journal”:http://www.gadgets-weblog.com/50226711/new_app_turns_your_gadget_into_a_vacation_documentary.php. I’ve installed but haven’t had time to play with yet. * “Yazsoft Sharetool”:http://www.yazsoft.com/products/sharetool/. Always am drawn to these tools that punch thru all the networking goo and let you get your files anywhere – “Homepipe”:https://www.homepipe.net/about.html is another one. But I never seem to stick with them. Something important in that statement.</p>
