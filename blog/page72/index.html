    <p>All my gear and props delivered from <a href="http://www.doortodoor.com/">door  to door storage</a> over the weekend and unpacked today.  I’ve used these guys for storage for 4 years now and they have been great.</p>

<p>Got my pneumatic valves hooked up to <a href="http://www.efx-tek.com/topics/prop-1.html">EFX-TEK :: Prop-1 Controller</a>. This is my planned controller strategy this year. Seems to work just great – I don’t have air hooked up yet but the valves are all click-clacking away under program control.</p>

<p>Also got my <a href="http://www.i-zombie.com/">i-zombie lighting controllers</a> today. As is obvious, I am moving away a little from pc-based control this year and towards a bunch of discrete systems – easier to debug, harder to manage.</p>

<p>Oh and <a href="http://www.scaredy-cat.com/bio.html">Scott</a> graciously showed me some of his past work – awesome. I am really motivated to give the axworthy ghost another try tho I may not have the time this year.</p>

<p>AUSTIN, TX–After watching their team’s decisive victory over the Texas Longhorns on Saturday, Ohio State fans realized that the Buckeyes were virtually unbeatable and perfect in every way. Having locked up the 2006 NCAA championship in only the second week of the season, those fans were left to ponder the only question remaining: Who will the Buckeyes beat in 2007?</p>

    <p>Of course the Buckeyes looked brilliant in beating Texas in Texas as expected. So all is basically right with the world. But look at the rest of these outcomes – <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/scoreboard/BIG10/2006/week2" title="NCAA Football Scoreboard - CBS SportsLine.com">NCAA Football Scoreboard - CBS SportsLine.com</a></p>

<p>* Wisconsin seemed to win handily over a weak opponent, they can feel good. * Michigan and Michigan State won by big margins over weak opponents – but each gave up a lot of first half points. * Iowa, Purdue, and Indiana struggled to win against clearly inferior opponents. I guess Indiana should feel good about any victory. * Penn State and Minnesota thumped by top 25 teams. * and Illinois and Northwestern thumped by weak opponents.</p>

<p>After the 11-0 Big Ten start last week I was feeling pretty good about the league. Not so much now.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2006/08/27/exploring-51-surround-tools.html">Exploring 5.1 surround tools</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’m working on creating some surround sound effects for my halloween setup this year. I’ve been looking for software to do this cheaply but no such luck so far.</p>

<p>I am starting with regular stereo flac files from various sfx discs i’ve purchased over the years. I’m using the 5.1 panning features of <a href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/Products/ShowProduct.asp?PID=1005&amp;KeyCode=7777-4701">Sony Acid Pro</a> to create a static path for the sound thru my listening space – this is pretty easy once you understand the complexities of Acid Pro. This leaves with an AcidPro-proprietary format ffile which you can play with AcidPro. For my purposes this might be good enough.</p>

<p>However it would be nice to create AC3 files that could be played on arbitrary PCs, burnt to dvd, etc. AcidPro will render AC3 files but it is another $199 for the codec pak to do this. I haven’t found much on the web for a free way to render AC3 – one thought tho is to loop back the spdif output from the pc to another soundcard and capture the incoming spdif stream – <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=338286">this post suggests how to do that</a>. But this is not going to be cheaper than just buying the codec pak.</p>

<p>I’d like to find some filter that could capture the spdif stream before it leaves the pc.</p>

<p>Another issue is playback. I am using winamp for playback (because i am playing with the <a href="http://discolitez.com/">discolitez</a> plugin) and winamp doesn’t natively support ac3 playback. <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/WinampAC3.htm">WinAmpAC3</a> looks like it may do the trick tho.</p>
