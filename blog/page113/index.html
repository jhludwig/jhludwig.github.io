I wonder if this is not typical of any capital-intensive industry, I seem to remember seeing the same analysis of the pulp and paper industry at one point tho I can’t lay my finger on it now. I don’t think this necessarily means a lot for society, society will still find a way to fund these industries as they have a lot of utility. As an individual investor or employee though, it certainly suggests that you should run away from these industries.</p>

    <p>I tried a couple years ago to rip all my software cds and just mount their images as virtual CDs. It kind of worked tho it was frustrating. Here are some new pointers that make it worth looking at again – <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a37b2934-badd-4482-a949-552af45bc3b0" title="ComputerZen.com">ComputerZen.com</a> points to a driver from MSFT that mounts an ISO file as a virtual CD. Cdfreaks has a lot of great posts about Ripping of CDs – for instance <a href="http://club.cdfreaks.com/showthread.php?threadid=77918">here</a> and <a href="http://club.cdfreaks.com/showthread/t-77918-p-2.html">here</a>. I don’t care about making copies of CDs but I would love the convenience of not having to have all my game CDs on my desk.</p>

I can see buying a super-blackberry that can do more, but I will never go back to a laptop.</p>

Obviously homes don’t need enterprise-quality SCM but I think we would all agree – finding and managing vendors and service providers for the home is a PITA. Maybe I am just the worst records manager in the world, but when my garage door opener died recently, it was a major effort to find the piece of paper with the installer’s name from 5 years ago. And when you sell a home, all that info generally is lost.</p>

<p>It would be cool if, at the neighborhood level, we could all easily share referrals on service providers, see comments, etc.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/12/02/hp-dvd-movie-writer-initial-review.html">HP DVD Movie Writer -- Initial Review</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve wanted to try this for a while – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001046.html" title="a little ludwig goes a long way: HP DVD Movie Writer again">a little ludwig goes a long way: HP DVD Movie Writer</a> – and so finally bought one and tried it out.</p>

<p>Net impression – I am a little disappointed. This is basically a usb-attached dvd burner with some bundled software. It has a few features to automate the transfer of a vhs tape to dvd – notably a bundled set of video in ports. But I was under the impression that a PC was hardly needed to transfer VHS tapes to DVD – the <a href="http://h30015.www3.hp.com/hp_dec/products/dvd_movie_writer.asp">hp site</a> says <em>“Transfer your home video to long-lasting DVDs … all without additional hardware or software.”</em> and <em>“Transfer, edit and preserve your home video ? even print DVD case covers ? with one easy-to-use device.”</em> and <em>“automatic, unattended conversion of your home movies”</em>.</p>

<p>Well that is all a little over the top. The device is non-functional without an attached PC driving it. And you have to interact a lot with the “Wizard” to get it to capture your tapes. And I am pretty sure you need at least two other devices – a pc and a printer – to print the dvd case covers. The bundled software is the normal set of bundled shlock you will find with a PC or dvd burner these days. Perhaps slightly more automated but the same basic crud.</p>

<p>Now, it did create playable DVDs which is something, this can be hard to do. I didn’t create a single coaster. So I guess it got some things right. But nowhere near as automated and trouble-free as implied.</p>

    <p>I’m curious to know what I can do with my Cisco ATA Voip interface box provided by Vonage. <a href="http://www.djernes.org/~shawn/ata186.htm" title="Asterisk">Shawn Djernes</a> has a little how-to on getting to the web interface, tho I am worried that Vonage has password-protected it. Here’s a <a href="http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/5PP0G0K75U.html">hack from last year</a> that might let me in, I don’t know what firmware I have tho. Anyone have any recos on how to look into the box?</p>

<p>Update: some more good links over on dslreports like <a href="http://www.iconnecthere.com/nonmembers/eng/accessories/accessories_ata.html">this guide to configuring the cisco ata186</a>.</p>

<p>Well dang, none of these work, because they are all specific to version 2.14 or lower of the firmware and i am on version 2.16. Still digging…</p>

<p>Update: the cisco site has some more <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/gatecont/ps514/products_configuration_example09186a00800c3a50.shtml">documentation on</a>…seems like maybe i should try accessing the device thru the IVR and perhaps opening up the device for web config.</p>
