				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">26 April 2019</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>In a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/amp/2019/04/25/mk-8-vw-golf-software-issues/">recent article about the latest VW Golf,</a> the product manager was quoted “Already now there are ten times more lines of code in the latest Golf than in a smartphone”. This statement is interesting in some many directions.</p>

<p>Software content in a car is growing exponentially as connectivity, autonomy, sensors, new compute platforms, electrification all drive into the car and this VW metric is an interesting indicator.</p>

<p>But is that too much software? It seems like my cellphone is jammed full of software, does my car really need 10X the lines of code?</p>

<p>But then the car has at least two major compute domains (UX and drive control) with many smaller compute loads, and maybe it is reasonable to have a lot more software than a smartphone?</p>

<p>Is KLOCs the right way to measure software? That is an ’80s way of thinking about software content and leads to some very bad behavior. Should anyone be proud of this?</p>

<p>What is the quality level of that software? Modern smartphones and the services that power them have the most highly compensated people in the industry banging away on them. How should we feel about a software system with 10x the number of components but with less highly compensated engineers? What is the total lifetime cost of all that software? What is the security exposure of all the software?</p>

<p>The biggest challenge VW is struggling with is OTA updates per the article. The OTA challenge in a car is broad – firmware, headunits, apps all have their own lifecycles and OTA needs. Is there an understanding that a great architecture for OTA and application isolation in the car are probably the first things that should have been put in place?</p>

<p>How much software should be on your mobile phone and in the cloud to support your driving? More or less than is in the car itself? How does that change when your car is always connected?</p>

<p>It is fascinating time in the auto industry. Software content is growing by leaps and bounds. While the VW number may be too high today, there is going to be a LOT more software content in cars over time.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Library-Book-Susan-Orlean/dp/1476740186/">The Library Book</a> by Susan Orlean. A peek inside the history, operations, and stories behind the LA Public Library, written by someone who loves books and libraries. Really enjoyable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Civility-Novel-Amor-Towles-ebook/dp/B004IYJDVG">Rules of Civility</a> by Amor Towles. Surprisingly fantastic tale of a young woman in Manhattan finding her way in the world pre WWII. Started slow but oh my gosh did it pick up. Inspiring in many ways.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trains-Buses-People-Opinionated-Transit/dp/1610919025">Trains, Buses, People: An Opinionated Atlas of US Transit</a> by Christof Spieler. Oh I love maps, and this book is chock full of them, and a great overview of transit in the US. It is easy to focus just on your community and not see the big picture, this really helps to provide context. If you just read Seattle papers, you’d think Seattle is screwing up transit constantly, but this book suggests Seattle is doing a decent job at building out an effective system.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paying-Party-College-Maintains-Inequality/dp/0674088026">Paying for the Party: How College Maintains Inequality</a> by Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton. This book intrigues and aggravates me. Which means it is worth reading and thinking about. A pretty damning takedown of the mainstream college education experience. It doesn’t line up with my own experience – but I saw signs of this dark side, and maybe I just lived in ignorance due to my focus and my advantages heading into college.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/1491-Second-Revelations-Americas-Columbus-ebook/dp/B000JMKVE4/">1491</a> by Charles Mann. Great exploration of the civilizations in America before the arrival of the Europeans. I don’t think I realized just how dramatic the die off due to European diseases was, nor how as a result, the world lost cultures and civilizations that rivaled those of Asia. Sobering, sad.</li>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Fracture-Daniel-T-Rodgers-ebook/dp/B004Z17I8M">Age of Fracture</a> by Daniel Rodgers. I really really wanted to like this book, it is well-regarded and seems to have an interesting thesis about what has happened in the last 50 years in our country. But overly wordy and repetitive, I just couldn’t stay with.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Responses-Organizations/dp/0674276604">Exit, Voice and Loyalty</a> by Albert Hirschman. What a difference from the work above. Tight, focused arguments with detailed supporting notes, with clear economic thinking. Really enjoyed this, a lot of insight into company behavior and political party behavior. Very nice.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Medusa-Uploaded-Novel-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B0756K6X32">Medusa Uploaded</a> by Emily Devenport. Starts out super strong, a laborer on a generation ship stumbles into layers and waves of conspiracy. But flags in the last third.</li>

				<p><p><img src="images/the-electric-state-9781501181412_hr-300x270.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bannerless-Saga-Carrie-Vaughn/dp/0544947304">Bannerless</a> by Carrie Vaughn. Excellent detective tale set in a future America devastated by ecological change. The protagonist is an investigator who travels town to town, and finds herself caught up in a mystery that drags up issues from her own past.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Order-Day-Eric-Vuillard/dp/1590519698">The Order of the Day</a> by Eric Vuillard. Short history of the events leading up to the German invasion of Austria. Literary, lyrical, almost whimsical in its writing, tho undercut by the great tragedy that was unfolding. And of course the book offers pointed lessons for our own time. Easy to see why this book has won so many honors.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Here-There-Everywhere-Recording-Beatles-ebook/dp/B000OVLIQU">Here, There, and Everywhere</a> by Geoff Emerick. A personal and much more human look at the Beatles career by one of the few people who were in the room with them a lot. The book is not without bias, but still super interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/IQ-Novel-Joe-Ide/dp/0316267724">IQ</a> by Joe Ide. Fantastic first novel featuring Isaiah Quintabe, a high school dropout working cases in LA for friends and associates. Great character, great setting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electric-State-Simon-Stålenhag-ebook/dp/B07CMMH9N1">The Electric State</a> by Simon Stålenhag. Exceptional story/art/graphic novel about a strange future/alternative America, where we have let technology run amok. The art is so integral to the story, I can’t imagine the Kindle version is worth buying.</li>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">01 January 2019</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I just reviewed all my books I read over the last year. Here are the ones that stick with me.</p>

<p>Fiction:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Systems-Red-Murderbot-Diaries/dp/0765397536">All Systems Red</a> by Martha Wells. The first in a super fun science fiction series</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Still-Life-Louise-Penny/dp/0312541538">Still life</a> by Louise Penny. The first in her series featuring Inspector Gamache, every entry I’ve read in the series is great.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Committee-Members-Julie-Schumacher/dp/0345807332">Dear Committee Members</a> by Julie Schumacher. Hilarious series of letters from a disgruntled professor</li>
</ul>

<p>On the nonfiction side:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-Lakes/dp/0393355551">The Death and Life of the Great Lakes</a> by Dan Egan. Won’t be everyone’s cup of tea but if you’ve spent time on the lakes, worth a read</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darkening-Age-Christian-Destruction-Classical/dp/0544800885">The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World</a> by Catherine Nixey. Probably will upset some readers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X">Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</a> by John Carreyrou. Wow, so much bad behavior by so many people.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Trump-Touches-Dies-Republican/dp/1982103124">Everything Trump Touches Dies: A Republican Strategist Gets Real About the Worst President Ever</a> by Rick Wilson. Lots of competition for books shining a light on our current “President”, this was my favorite.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Command-Control-Damascus-Accident-Illusion/dp/0143125788">Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety</a> by Eric Schlosser. Wow we have had so many near misses. And this is nuclear weapons – how much slop and error is there in other governmental and corporate processes (say, drug testing) where the stakes are much lower?</li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome any comments or reading ideas from others!</p>

				<p><p>Every year we play a couple board games over the holiday season. This year’s winner was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plaid-Hat-Games-PH1000-Winter/dp/B00HFKITJC">Dead of Winter.</a> The combination of collaborative play with individual secret objectives is great – encourages a lot of dialog but you never quite know if you are hearing the truth. And the surprise changes to objectives or surprise events that happen every turn keeps everyone hoping. Not a short game to play but a lot of fun. We played with 5 people and it was perfect.</p>

This year’s winner was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plaid-Hat-Games-PH1000-Winter/dp/B00HFKITJC">Dead of Winter.</a> The combination of collaborative play with individual secret objectives is great – encourages a lot of dialog but you never quite know if you are hearing the truth. And the surprise changes to objectives or surprise events that happen every turn keeps everyone hoping. Not a short game to play but a lot of fun. We played with 5 people and it was perfect.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guest-Room-Vintage-Contemporaries/dp/0804170983">The Guest Room</a> by Chris Bohjalian.  Sad story about human trafficking and its victims, wrapped up inside a suspense novel.  A little uncomfortable at times, human trafficking is an ugly business.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bring-Me-Back-B-Paris/dp/1250151333">Bring Me Back</a> by B. A. Paris.  Marketed as a great beach read, at first I thought this was an engaging tale, and then I realized that the two protagonists are possibly the two stupidest people I have ever encountered in a novel.  Abandoned.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Army-None-Autonomous-Weapons-Future/dp/0393608980">Army of None</a> by Paul Scharre,  An examination of the issues around autonomous weapons.  Mixed feelings.  Some of the writing is very clumsy, but the discussion of the human/weapons systems integration issues are interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Fascism-Works-Politics-Them/dp/0525511830">How Fascism Works</a> by Jason Stanley.  A catalog of the mechanics of fascism (and an examination of how they are being used today).  Depressing.</li>
