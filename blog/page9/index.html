				<p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43256597-night-boat-to-tangier">Night Boat to Tangier</a> by Kevin Barry. Another great novel by Barry, two men’s lives explored over the course of an evening, great characters and dialog.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48654.Story">Story</a> by Robert McKee. I have no intention of ever writing a screenplay, but this book is highly useful for anyone who needs to communicate ideas – really forces you to think about your story and how to structure it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38322550-the-last-emperox">The Last Emperox</a> by John Scalzi. The first book in this series was interesting, and this closing was satisfying but not particularly memorable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9178059-shakedown">Shakedown</a> by Steven Malanga. There may be some good points in here, but the author doesn’t really help himself get his point out. One, he doesn’t really articulate what his goals are besides railing at unions and the new left. I know he hates union influence in education but I don’t really know what he wants to do about education. Two, he brings out a lot of data in anecdotal form, but never gives the overall context. I don’t know how upset to be about a certain number unless I understand overall spending, what a successful budget looks like, some success examples, etc. Three, he loves to use pejorative words like like “corpulent” and “porcine” and “lavish” and “stratospheric” in place of data, and that is just off-putting – as if he knows he can’t make his case rationally, so he is trying to inflame instead. And anyone who uses these words to describe teacher compensation seems a little disconnected from reality – I don’t know a lot of teachers celebrating their outrageous economic good fortune.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14662.The_Red_and_the_Black">The Red and the Black</a> by Stendhal. Time travel! Reading a book written in 1830 gives you a little view back into that world. Some archaic wording but human nature hasn’t changed, and the book structure seems almost modern.</li>
</ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Tigner-ebook/dp/B07NXXYG1G">The Price of Time</a> by TIm Tigner. What a crappy suspense story. Poor characters, poor plot, just bad. I don’t know why I stuck with it, I am embarrassed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Transitions-Making-Sense-Lifes-Changes/dp/0738285404">Transitions</a> by William Bridges. Much to think about in this book. I have certainly not been thoughtful about the transitions in my life and it is near time to start thinking about the remaining transitions ahead of me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-D-D-Novel-ebook/dp/B01M0HPHR6">The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O</a> by Neil Stephenson and Nicole Galland. Fun time travel historical novel. A trifle long.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical/dp/0307947904">Dark Money</a> by Jane Mayer. Good book but it will be hard to finish. I knew that the Koch’s and their ilk were amoral self-interested traitorous manipulative bas%#@ds but this really brings it home, it is hard to read. It is A-OK to have different views on issues in our society, but the way they have used their money to corrupt the system is sickening.</li>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">28 June 2020</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I’m looking over a bookshelf that I haven’t looked at in a while and there are some books I really fondly remember there. (And also a lot of books I have no memory of.) I am reflecting on how I really want to spend my time reading — I want to read more of these impactful books, and probably read fewer of the ones that are basically junk food.</p>

<p>Some of the great titles that caught my eye:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sparrow-Novel-Book-ebook/dp/B000SEIFGO">The Sparrow</a> by Mary Doris Russell. What a great book exploring morals and culture and misunderstanding.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Party-Classic-Moncure-Pantheon/dp/0375706437">The Wild Party</a> by Joseph Moncure March. I am not deep into poetry but this is nothing but fun. I’ve read this several times.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fatal-Shore-epic-Australias-founding-ebook/dp/B006NKL884">The Fatal Shore</a> by Robert Hughes. Probably needs some updating but an unvarnished look at one aspect of the British empire.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mismeasure-Man-Revised-Expanded/dp/0393314251">The Mismeasure of Man</a> by Stephen Jay Gould. Everything by Gould is excellent, this may be among the most important.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Death-Liberal-England-1910-1914-ebook/dp/B075CMYJS6">The Strange Death of Liberal England</a> by George Dangerfield. A fascinating and literary history tale. The title alone makes this book 100x more interesting than most history books.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ron-Chernow/dp/0679438084">Titan</a> by Ron Chernow. Learned so much about the growth of Standard Oil, and all the good and bad along the way.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Tides-Tim-Powers-ebook/dp/B004LLII12">On Stranger Tides</a> by Tim Powers. Powers has written some powerfully entertaining stories, and never got the renown he deserved.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567">Godël, Escher, Bach</a> by Douglas R Hofstadter. I’d recommend this to everyone. Definitely a desert island read. UPDATE: a reader suggests this one has not aged well, I may crack it open again.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Education-Speculator-Victor-Niederhoffer/dp/0471249483">The Education of a Speculator</a> by Victor Niederhoffer. Gets mixed reviews but I think that is because people expect to learn investment secrets in here, which is not what this book is about. It is more about the human side of his life.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Screwtape-Letters-C-S-Lewis/dp/0060652934">The Screwtape Letters</a> by C. S. Lewis. Whether you are a Christian or not, this is incredibly insightful and engaging. I’ve read many times.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Princess-Mars-Edgar-Rice-Burroughs/dp/1949982998">A Princess of Mars</a> by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I am sure this has aged horribly and I should probably be embarrassed about this one. But as a kid, this was a great rollicking adventure.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Bead-Game-Magister-Novel/dp/0312278497">The Glass Bead Game</a> by Herman Hesse. This hit me hard when I first read it, very introspective look at finding meaning and place in life.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d love to hear about books others have rediscovered…</p>

				<p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upheaval/dp/0141977787">Upheaval</a> by Jared Diamond. Not as breakthrough as his earlier work, but an engaging look at crises and how nations react to them. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Finland because I was so ignorant of Finnish history.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lamb-Gospel-According-Christs-Childhood/dp/0380813815">Lamb</a> by Christopher Moore. An irreverent modern gospel, fun to read and still very true to the story and meaning of Christ. Will not be everyone’s cup of tea but I loved it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eric-Posner-ebook/dp/B07TP5HLWQ">Radical Markets</a> by Eric Posner and E. Glen Weyl. It promises radical ideas to improve the functioning of our markets and society. The first chapter was a little slow. In the second chapter they introduce their ideas for voting, and then offhandedly state that they have patented all this and have software you can buy. And I realize “Damn, this is a whitepaper for their business, and I paid for it.” Didn’t finish.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clockwork-Dynasty-Daniel-H-Wilson-ebook/dp/B01LXFO711">The Clockwork Dynasty</a> by Daniel H. Wilson. Fun story about automatons who have been hiding within human society for eons, and their struggle to understand their own morality and purpose. I’m not sure it is a 4.5 star read but I was entertained.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Uncertainty-Decision-Making-Beyond-Numbers-ebook/dp/B07TJ1YW3Q">Radical Uncertainty</a> by John Kay and Mervyn King. A little academic but I still loved it. Our mania for models and planning is all for naught in a world swept by health care crises, climate crises, social crises, financial crises. We need to continually focus on what is going on underneath the numbers, and invest in resiliency to make it through the shifts and shocks. Good read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Economics-Times-Abhijit-Banerjee-ebook/dp/B07PCQLKSS">Good Economics for Hard Times</a> by Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo. Interesting discussions but not as foundational as Radical Uncertainty.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Don-Eyles-ebook/dp/B07L9YQ9WV/">Sunburst and Luminary</a> by Don Eyles. Fascinating story inside the Apollo program, great depth on the software and compute environment. Most people will find this book a little too in the software weeds but I enjoyed it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Tomorrow-Brendan-Mathews-ebook/dp/B01MT5299R">The World of Tomorrow</a> by Brendan Mathews. Great story of three brothers in New York in the years before WWII, all working their schemes. Great characters.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Least-Believe-Still-Christian-ebook/dp/B00AZ3W2IU">What’s the Least I Can Believe and Still Be a Christian</a> by Martin Thielen. I was raised Presbyterian but it didn’t really take. I still tho got a lot of value out of this book, particularly the first half which debunks some of the worst behaviours of some “Christians”. Recommended for believers and non-believers both.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Divine-Vol-Faust-Act-ebook/dp/B015X9BE8Y">The Wicked + The Divine</a> by Gillen, McKelvie, Wilson, Cowles. I try a graphic novel every so often and this got good reviews. Didn’t really catch my attention, jumped in midstream to the characters and I didn’t ever bond to any of them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock-ebook/dp/B00RKO6MS8">Super Forecasting</a> by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner. Great book about forecasting and leadership. The basic rules resonate across so many fields – be tangible; measure performance; iterate. Really nice work.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Planet-Adventure-Chasch-Servants-Dirdir/dp/0312854889">Planet of Adventure</a> by Jack Vance. If you like Burrough’s Mars books, then you will like this. I read the Burroughs books when I was very young, and they have not held up well, but I loved them as a kid. And I kind of love this tho again has not aged well.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201715953">Introduction to Econometrics</a> by James H. Stock, Mark W. Watson. On my shelves for 16 years, not sure why. An average intro to regression analysis.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-World-100-Objects-ebook/dp/B0052RCX0G/">A History of the World in 100 Objects</a> by Neil MacGregor. Much better than I anticipated, a very readable and visual walk thru the entire span of human history.</li>
