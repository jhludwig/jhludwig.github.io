				<p><p>A great launch yesterday – <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b29aa2fb-5bb2-356c-8fac-6fa51b767a69/%5B%24%24%5D-docusign-shows-strong.html\">Docusign IPO.</a></p>

<p>Congrats to everyone there.  And a big congrats and thanks to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jonathan-roberts">JonRo</a> who unflaggingly championed and supported the company through every zig and zag.  He taught me such valuable investment lessons about persistence and about survival – he stuck with Docusign (and other investments) through every dip, through every tough spot, as they went in and out of fashion, and it all ultimately paid off for Docusign and Ignition investors.  Thanks Jon.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dry-Novel-Jane-Harper-ebook/dp/B01BSN15F6">The Dry</a> by Jane Harper. A breathless page turner according to the reviews – i did consume in about 2 days. Very solid tale set in rural Australia – murder, money, long-hidden secrets.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/04/recent-books-the-dry-easternization-comey/41cc2zc0isl-_sx331_bo1204203200_/"><img src="images/41cC2Zc0IsL._SX331_BO1204203200_-200x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Easternization-Asias-Americas-Decline-Beyond-ebook/dp/B01I85OO00">Easternization</a> by Gideon Rachman.  A good summary of the rise of China and the impact on US domestic and foreign policy.  There is no getting around the fact that China’s economy and hence soft power and military power is going to surpass that of the US, it is simple numbers.  And much about that is OK, China becoming richer is no real threat to us and no real threat to world peace.  That said, there might be some issues that the US differs from China on, and if the US wants a strategy to counter China, we need to focus on multilateral partnerships in Asia and/or Europe and/or the Americas.  We are doing a poor job at that.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Higher-Loyalty-Truth-Lies-Leadership-ebook/dp/B074J6F41V">A Higher Loyalty</a> by James Comey.  Some of you may have heard of this book.  Comey seems very principled.  He doesn’t like Trump and writes a compelling indictment.  I believe he fails tho to really understand his missteps around the election.  Every decision he made was a principled local optimum but globally was an asymmetric skew.  And he doesn’t go to the meta level and discuss how the FBI should behave in the future.  We can take it as a given that both major candidates in the future will have various accusations made against them, and the FBI should probably simply announce that they are investigating both candidates and be transparent about the nature of the charges against them.</li>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I am so saddened and angered about the Parkland shooting. I work with a colleague who lost his child. I have been useless in the last week processing this.</p>

<p>I’ve sat by year after year as these shootings have happened and done nothing. I need to do my part, I need to speak up, I need to take whatever action I can.</p>

<p>I will demand to my representatives that we try to address these shootings. And I am open to trials on many fronts. Reasonable restrictions on assault rifles, let’s try it. More mental health support, let’s try it. Hardening schools, let’s try it. I have my own beliefs about which of these will be most effective (restrictions on assault rifles), but I support any steps that address the shootings, and preferably a basket of steps. Let’s try them all, measure how they do, and try again. The exact steps are not important — it is the repeated trying that matters.</p>

<p>I will demand to my local and state representatives that we try things locally. Don’t try to “boil the ocean” at the Federal level. Start at the state and local level. That is how the country made progress on LGBT rights.</p>

<p>I will support candidates who refuse to take gun lobby money. I want candidates who work on behalf of citizens, not the gun lobby.</p>

<p>We each need to decide how we are going to react to these shootings. I will speak my feelings, and I will demand that we try policies to address the problem, and that we repeatedly try.</p>

				<p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mansions-Madness-Board-Game-2nd/dp/B01J4NB6CO">Mansions of Madness</a> was surprisingly fun.  <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/01/this-holidays-board-game-winners-mansions-of-madness-king-of-tokyo/unnamed/"><img src="images/unnamed-300x169.png" alt="" /></a>We had low expectations, it just didn’t look like our kind of game.  Cooperative sounded too nice. But the pace is good, the iPad app really helped run the game, and once we realized that going “insane” in the game opened up play quite a bit, we had a lot of fun.  Definitely recommended.  Not a short game tho.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/King-Tokyo-New-Board-Game/dp/B01F46RPS4">King of Tokyo</a> – super fast to play, easy gameplay, and the game can shift dramatically in seconds.  Also recommended, and you can fly through a game.</p>

<p>A disappointment was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bezier-Games-ONUWBEZ-Ultimate-Werewolf/dp/B00HS7GG5G">One Night Werewolf</a>.  Maybe we needed more eggnog.  With 5 people, it seemed like the outcomes were obvious.  Maybe we were doing it wrong.</p>
