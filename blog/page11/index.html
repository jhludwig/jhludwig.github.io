				<p><p>Between <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/09/18/ccleaner-cybersecurity-app-infected-with-backdoor/#39607ff7316a">this news</a> and the Kapersky revelations last week, I think the strategy most people should follow for their personal pcs is clear.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t visit sketchy sites that are offering you free software, free movies, etc.  And never download software offering the same.  ”If you aren’t the customer, you are the product.”</li>
  <li>Don’t install 3rd party AV/Security software, this software digs into the heart of your system and just creates another source of vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li>Do accept all patches from your OS vendor – Microsoft or Apple. You should probably allow them to auto patch your system without your intervention.  You have already thrown your lot in with them, why hold back.</li>
  <li>Do run the latest OS from your OS vendor.  That is where their best and brightest people are working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft and Apple have a gajillion people working on security, it is in their interest to protect their products from attacks, you should align yourself with them.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Big-John-Crowley-ebook/dp/B005DB7O0U">Little, Big</a> by John Crowley. Well-regarded and I enjoyed some of the characters, but it lost me when it quickly flipped into faerie. Gave up on.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2017/06/recent-books-crowley-goldbarth-bob-hope-phenomena-raj-harry-august-tom-rob-smith-etc/books-bob_hope_biography-0fd28/"><img src="images/Books-Bob_Hope_Biography-0fd28-198x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Form-Content-Essays/dp/1555977618">The Adventures of Form and Content</a> by Albert Goldbarth. Goldbarth can be challenging but these are excellent essays. I aspire to be as well-read and thoughtful as he is.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Entertainer-Century-Richard-Zoglin-ebook/dp/B00IWTWTFK">Hope</a> by Richard Zoglin. I never thought I’d be interested in a biography of Bob Hope, but a fascinating life story. He was an absolutely dominant entertainer in almost all forms of popular media, and could be incredibly generous, and yet had massive massive flaws. An interesting human being.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phenomena-Governments-Investigations-Extrasensory-Psychokinesis-ebook/dp/B01HZFB2T0">Phenomena</a> by Annie Jacobsen. Got great reviews but the nonsense discussed drove me away. Gave up on.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Empire-British-Conquest-India-ebook/dp/B01IMZ5GFI">The Chaos of Empire</a> by Jon Wilson. Another I abandoned quickly. From past readings I’ve know the British were none too pleasant as they built their empire, and I wanted to learn more, but the early parts of this book just droned on and on with no insight.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farm-Tom-Rob-Smith-ebook/dp/B00FPQCWR8">The Farm</a> by Tom Rob Smith. His earlier books are excellent, but he just never found his voice in this one. A satisfying ending but not a great read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Fifteen-Lives-Harry-August-ebook/dp/B00ECE9OD4">The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</a> by Claire North. Fun. Not memorable but fun.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Orbit-Carolyn-Ives-Gilman-ebook/dp/B00R697BMS">Dark Orbit</a> by Carolyn Ives Gilman. My Kindle says I read this, and the Amazon blurb sounds familiar, but for the life of me, I couldn’t tell you anything about. Read whatever you want to into this.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Graves-Full-Jamie-Mason-ebook/dp/B008J2AEQG">Three Graves Full</a> by Jamie Mason. An attempt at a Fargo-like tale but eh. Not funny enough.</li>

				<p><p>My workflow for years on my MBP has centered on VMWare running Debian/Ubuntu, and all my tools in the VM.</p>

<p>For developing code targeting AWS services, I thought I’d try using Docker for Mac and running Debian images with Docker.</p>

<p>Well that didn’t work. <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/time-in-container-is-out-of-sync/16566">This bug involving time drift in a container</a> has been around for a year now, with no attention paid to it. It basically makes it impossible to access any AWS services. I have to conclude that no one is actually using Docker for Mac.</p>

<p>I’ve also for years used a variety of editors and IDEs on both the Mac and Linux side. I heard such good things about VSCode that I decided to try it. But after any amount of time running it, it starts to miss keystrokes – I first noticed it wasn’t responding to copy/paste from the keyboard, then it also started to fail on simple text entry. I have no time for this, as cool as VSCode may be, it fails on the fundamentals.</p>

				<p><p>Created a site using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar">Codestar</a>. It was pretty easy (the ssh setup instructions are the trickiest thing, they are not perfectly clear). And I like that the resultant site embraces AWS cloud services. But in its drive to easy dev, codestar masks what is going on under the covers, and I am left with a site that I don’t really know how to modify and extend because I don’t understand what has happened beneath me. I doubt I will use it much.</p>

<p>UPDATE: If you think of codestar as just a way to seed a project, it is kind of useful. it would have taken me a while to correctly configure IAM, CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CloudFormation, and Lambda. A tool to seed a project with all this correctly set up is useful. I wish that the tool would emit a script to let me idempotently recreate the project from scratch including all IAM settings.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">25 March 2017</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>The AHCA has failed and people are frustrated and tired. The Republicans want to move on. Trump wants to move on. Some Dems want to gloat. But there is no moving on from this discussion, healthcare is too central an issue in people’s lives.</p>

<p>The AHCA was a political construct. It was “designed” to meet the political objectives of Trump (meet his campaign promise of doing something fast, without regard to what that was) and the political objectives of the republican leadership (destroy Obamacare without regard to how). As a piece of policy, it was harmful to most Americans, and the design of the bill and the effort to pass it were slapdash and amateurish.</p>

<p>It was brought down by the conservative and moderate wings of the party – the conservatives wanted more free market structuring, the moderates didn’t want to hurt their constituents.</p>

<p>So, now what. We have a turned a corner in this country. The Frum article (https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/the-republican-waterloo/520833/?utm_source=atlfb) and Naam’s observations about the Overton window (https://www.facebook.com/ramez.naam/posts/10154105976537493?match=b3ZlcnRvbiB3aW5kb3csb3ZlcnRvbix3aW5kb3c%3D) are useful to read. The electorate has come to expect universal coverage at a reasonable cost (which is what Trump ran on though he was just being politically expedient). Plans that rip away coverage from the poor, from children, from young mothers – those will never get through.</p>

<p>And inaction on costs is not acceptable. People are paying too much for healthcare today. They are mad about it. The US has the highest costs of any developed nation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita). Failure to address the ruinous costs borne by the middle class and working class will result in midterm loss of Republican house seats, and turnover in Democrat seats as well.</p>

<p>The Republican leadership (or new Republican leadership) needs to accept reality. They can’t just throw up their hands, say “darn it”, and move on to their next dream of tax reform. There is plenty of room to work on costs and improve the functioning of the ACA – see Naam’s list (http://rameznaam.com/2017/03/25/healthcare-improvements-republicans-could-make/). There is plenty of room in a system with universal basic coverage to insert market dynamics. The Republicans need to turn their attention to these opportunities. The Democrats need to lead with reasonable proposals and support reasonable efforts.</p>

<p>No one can walk away from the healthcare discussion.</p>

Most fascinating to me was the description of their skin, with its color change capability, embedded photoreceptors, and highly distributed nervous system. I would have liked more cephalopod info.</li>

<p>Atlassian products have more ways to group and scope content, each of which has a million attributes and quirks. It is exhausting and I find myself pushed away from their products. All of this bucketing and grouping does not help me understand what the hell is going on at all.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Nations-History-Regional-Cultures/dp/0143122029">American Nations</a> by Colin Woodard.  Very good and topical read.  I don’t think the boundaries between the nations are quite as crisp as he suggests but his model is very helpful for thinking about how the different parts of the country are thinking about politics these days.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547">Hillbilly Elegy</a> by J.D.

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I purchased a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0178IC734">TP-Link Smart Plug</a>, a top seller in home improvement, to control turning on and off our Christmas tree lights from our Amazon Echo. The final working solution is pretty slick, it works reliably, and it is pretty tolerant of slight differences in phrasing.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/11/amzn-should-make-their-own-home-automation-gear/%e6%89%93%e5%8d%b0/"><img src="images/HS100_us_V1_1134_normal_0_20151017175028-300x225.jpg" alt="打印" /></a>But setup was a long path of horrible. Create a tp-link online account. Download their Kasa iOS app (Really love the profusion of brand names – control our TP-Link™ Smart Plug with the kasa™ iOS app using the Alexa™ integration with our Amazon Echo™). Plug in the TP-Link device and then join it to the kasa app, doing the “private wifi hotspot” dance common to so many iot devices, where you have to leave the app and join a goofy wifi hotspot temporarily. Wait while the pairing happens. Then set a friendly name for the device in the kasa app. Go to the url in the paper instructions to set up Alexa integration. This points you back to a menu in the kasa app. This sends you back to a web page with Alexa integration instructions. Go two menus down in the Amazon Alexa phone app (why isn’t this the Amazon Echo phone app? I bought an Echo. I never bought anything called Alexa) to install a new smart home skill, the TP-Link Kasa skill. Search in the Alexa app for connected devices and pick the tp-link device. Provide the Alexa app with tp-link login credentials. Now I guess it is all set up but I have no idea what phrase to say. Take a guess that the friendly name I gave the tp-link device 8 steps ago is the thing to say, and yay it is.</p>

<p>I bet when I install a 2nd one I get to do much of this again. Kind of dreading that.</p>

<p>How will regular humans do all this? Return rates and support calls must be high. The tp-link should have been pre-provisioned with the necessary wifi connectivity, and the Alexa skill should have been pre-installed, and the phrase should have been pre-configured to a default. And I should have just plugged it in, and it should have worked in seconds.</p>

<p>If AMZN wants this to be a mainstream use, they need to preconfigure the devices, like they preconfigure Kindles or other AMZN hardware. Which probably entails AMZN building their own devices, or running a very strong branding/qualification program. Otherwise this is going to be a very niche experience. Or someone else (GOOG or APPL) will figure this out and displace the Echo.</p>

				<p><p>I find myself a little befuddled these days about our country. Some days I find myself feeling a lot of anger. The decision by a significant minority of our electorate to hand the reins of government to an unfit man, for the sake of unspecified change, is difficult to understand. But I can’t control what happens in distant places, I can’t control how people feel.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/2016/11/lets-stay-positive-and-focus-on-seattle-and-the-west-coast/15032247_10103910583670978_4320759830836294903_n/"><img src="images/15032247_10103910583670978_4320759830836294903_n-300x225.jpg" alt="15032247_10103910583670978_4320759830836294903_n" /></a>What I can control is my own effort and time. And the real opportunity in front of me is to commit myself to making our local community and state an even better place to live. To be more tolerant, more welcoming, give more people a hand up, help create more economic activity, help more people who need help, etc. Seattle is a vibrant place, the state of Washington is an amazing place to live, the West Coast is a great region, but we are not perfect and we have more to do.</p>

<p>As a first tiny positive step, we’ll be attending the <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/events/24690938/peaceful-trump-response-join-hands-around-green-lake">rally at Green Lake this weekend</a> to stand up against fear and hate, and to show our support for the most vulnerable parts of the community. And we also want to demonstrate to local politicians that the community is committed to tolerance and civil rights, and that we will stand with local leaders to fight racism, sexism, xenophobia, etc.</p>

<p>I am confident that we can continue to make Seattle and the West a vibrant and attractive place to live, with great broad-based economies and great tolerance. We have much to do, but we have a great set of people here to do it with.</p>
