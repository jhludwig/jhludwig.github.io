  <h1><a href="/2013/12/07/nbc-dont-screw-this-up-by-making-better-tv-musicals.html">NBC, don't screw this up by making better TV musicals</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Apparently the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/business/media/live-performance-of-sound-of-music-is-big-hit-for-nbc.html?ref=business&amp;_r=0">live Sound of Music was hugely popular</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NBC’s gamble of filling an entire night with live musical theater paid off handsomely on Thursday as “The Sound of Music,” with Carrie Underwood in the Julie Andrews role of Maria, posted the network’s best entertainment ratings for a Thursday night since 2009.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so we are going to get a lot more of these apparently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…this gamble — live theater on network television, a throwback to earlier eras of the medium and events like “Peter Pan” and “Cinderella” — paid off so well it is almost a certainty that the network will be looking for other musicals to mount live around holidays.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We turned it on and left it on for a while and were stunned at just how bad the show was. We found ourselves asking “How did this get on the air?”, “They must have known it was awful, didn’t they?”. And apparently we weren’t alone, as twitter was alive with hate-watchers, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/arts/television/carrie-underwood-stars-in-nbcs-live-sound-of-music.html?ref=arts">critics dumped on the show</a>.</p>

<p>So, NBC, don’t screw this up by doing more of these with bigger budgets, more rehearsals, better actors. That is not why we watched. We watched for the same reason we read about Lindsay Lohan, the reason we watch Jerry Springer and New Jersey Housewives. We love watching carnage unfold before our eyes in slow motion.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/3809445908_9c6d47ff1c.jpg"><img src="images/3809445908_9c6d47ff1c-300x201.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seattlemunicipalarchives/" /></a>My advice – rehearse less. Have Taylor Swift sing live, maybe in some more duets with Stevie Nicks. Hire unstable people – Amanda Bynes and Alec Baldwin seem perfect for the next one. Intentionally antagonize your stars. Inject some randomness into the live performance – have part of the set collapse mid-scene. Liberally stock the backstage area with alcohol. Surprise one of the stars with a cameo from a recent ex.</p>

<p>I’ll watch the next one if I know there is a chance someone will walk offstage in a huff, or go in a rampage live and light part of the set on fire.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/11/30/giving-up-for-now-on-google-two-factor-auth.html">Giving up for now on Google Two Factor Auth</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I love the idea of two factor auth, and I think Google has generally done a good job on it, they have certainly tried to make it easy to use .</p>

<p>But the collision of iOS/OSX and Google TFA is just killing me. The problem probably lies in the Apple products – when you configure a machine to do imap email PLUS smtp send PLUS calendar sync PLUS address book sync, it is just broken. The application specific password provided by google has to get squirreled away by all these apps and it doesn’t appear to work, I consistently have problems keeping SMTP send working. I’ve tried recreating the application specific password multiple times and I always end up broken somehow.</p>

<p>Google is not without fault tho. I have two google-hosted accounts I use regularly – a gmail.com account and my theludwigs.com account. When I try to configure the security settings, the Google web pages get super confused about which account I am in. I’ll try to set the security settings for the theludwigs.com account and I get the page for the gmail account.</p>

<p>So for now I am giving up.</p>

  <p>“Great college football rivalries engage the healthy, activate the disturbed, fascinate the thoughtful, amaze the detached, mystify the rational, horrify the scholarly, encourage the immature, enrich the greedy, and terrify the faint of heart,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Bill Curry, via <a href="http://search.espn.go.com/mark-schlabach/">Mark Schlabach</a> on <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/notebook/_/page/onthemark-131125/ranking-rivalries">ESPN</a>.</p>

<p>Personally I am happy to let my immature and disturbed sides out this week! Michigan football has been sad this year and here is hoping that the sadness continues!</p>

<p>My two earliest vivid memories of the rivalry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Going to the game in Ann Arbor with the family in the early 70s. We had seats in the student section. Some drunk Michigan student next to me kept pushing into my seat and spilling wine on me. We brought a large helium balloon to the game with OSU signage on it, and someone shot it.</li>
  <li>Driving home from the ‘73 tie game, and hearing the announcement that OSU was going to the Rose Bowl, experiencing the double joy of knowing that OSU was going bowling, and Michigan was not. All the cars with Ohio plates on the highway started honking horns and waving, it was a mobile celebration.</li>

  <h1><a href="/2013/11/18/my-android-experiment-is-over-back-to-the-iphone.html">My Android experiment is over, back to the iPhone</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>3 months in and I am done in by hardware failure – I dropped the LG G2, not very much of a drop, and got a nice transverse screen crack that completely disabled touch detection. The device is basically useless. Faced with a need to upgrade, I reverted back to iOS-land and got an iphone 5s.</p>

<p>my net impressions on my return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Again, if an Android phone is your first smartphone, you will be happy. Nice big screen, good battery life, lots of apps.</li>
  <li>The iphone screen seems positively puny now and I really wish the iphone was a little bigger. and the battery is correspondingly smaller, pretty sure I will struggle with battery life again. I would be a fan of a bigger iphone.</li>
  <li>however I have dropped iphones a kajillion times, and they have come away with a lot of corner dings but nothing worse. one drop of my lg and it is trash. :(</li>
  <li>the wideopen nature of android is appealing and I really liked getting widgetized content right on the screen. however the android community is not using this wideopen nature to best effect – the oems and carriers jam all kinds of redundant garbage on the phone, and the launchers and customizing apps can leave your phone a mess, as can app installs.</li>
  <li>the iphone homescreen and shell seems old and static by comparison.</li>
  <li>software fit and finish on the iphone is just SO much better. better touch detection. higher typing accuracy. nicer looking dialogs. fewer clicks to do almost everything.</li>
  <li>and of course the iphone retail experience at an apple store is 10000x better than buying android at retail. I was in and out of apple store in 5 minutes despite a huge crowd. I did go to the att store first to look at possibly an android replacement and despite a much smaller crowd, had to wait 20 minutes. the att staff (or customers) insist on walking through activation there, and of course the att reps also insist on explaining the fractal set of voice/data plans that att offers. the rep tried to convince me that my best option was to add a second line to my account for $30 more a month, so for just a minimum $720 2 year total commitment they would give me some device for free! That sounds great! Give me the undercoating too!</li>
</ul>

<p>basically my advice is – if you can afford an iphone, you will probably be happier in the long run. tho the android experience is still a good experience.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/11/17/my-last-goofy-hardware-purchase-of-the-week-sticknfind.html">My last goofy hardware purchase of the week -- StickNFind</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>So I bought a 4-pack of <a href="https://www.sticknfind.com/">StickNFind</a> BLE stickers. I’m not quite sure why. My hope was I guess that you could use these things for very fine-grained local resolution. Like maybe you could stick them onto game tokens and be able to track game tokens around a board.</p>

<p>Well, not happening. The spatial resolution of these things is pretty gross. At best you can say “hey something is within 5 feet of me”. And there is great variation across stickers. For instance if you line them up at distances of 1, 2, 3, and 4 feet from your phone, you will detect them all, but the apparent ordering of them per the phone will not correlate to their physical distance at all. Not sure why – differences in battery strength, in sticker orientation, in phone orientation, or in manufacturing? Whatever, not happening.</p>

<p>Overall packaging was good, easy to get these started, the app is fine tho they need to take some of the anti-skeumorphic vaccine that is going around. No complaints about quality or ease of use, but these are just very limited devices. I’m honestly not sure what I will do with them. The examples on the box don’t compel me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>find your keys, phone, remote. OK the phone one is stupid since i need the phone app to find the phone. The remote, maybe, but this just isn’t that exciting. My keys are always in my pocket.</li>
  <li>find your wallet, purse, briefcase. The few times I have misplaced my wallet at a store, I have wished that I had some magic solution, but this wouldn’t help, since my problem is not “my wallet is someplace 30 feet around me” but is “my wallet is at one of N distant stores I visited”.</li>
  <li>find your pets? We are dog people and our dog is overly needy, no problem finding the dog.</li>
  <li>find your tablets and tools and toys and cameras. Again not a huge problem</li>
  <li>find your kids. We’ve aged out of that problem. Well we may still have the problem but again it is “where in some distant city is my child”, not “is my child within 100 ft of here”</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be nice maybe if I could put these on some super valuable things in the house and automatically be alerted if they move. I’m not sure what those things are tho.</p>

<p>Maybe I will put them in my cars and quit worrying about remembering where I park.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-cameras/sony-cyber-shot-dsc/4505-6501_7-35827131.html">reviews of this thing have been pretty tepid</a>. And if you review this thing as a competitor to a point and shoot, the reviews are right – this is a pretty funky/bad point and shoot. Clumsy to handle, poor UI, hooking this onto your phone feels downright clumsy and bizarre.</p>

<p>But the concept is super intriguing, though not as a point and shoot replacement. But the ability to mount the lens in one location and control from another is very cool. There are scenarios where I would love this. GoPro scenarios. Events. I have to noodle on.</p>

<p>One thing they have to fix is the horrible custom SSID thing. That is just terrible. Because it means my iPad or iPhone can’t simultaneously connect over wifi to the internet. It should either connect over bluetooth or use an available wifi network.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/11/15/i-got-me-some-noontang.html">I got me some Noontang!</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Today is the day for offbeat hardware tinkering.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/NTR_Android_02.jpg"><img src="images/NTR_Android_02-300x194.jpg" alt="NTR_Android_02" /></a>OK I had to order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cyanics-NoonTang-Pointer-Presenter-Samsung/dp/B00AZPB4PA/">this for the name alone</a>. I mean, who doesn’t want <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Noontang">noontang</a>?</p>

<p>The experience is psychotic. The packaging is super nice actually, very simple, clean looking box, looks like it belongs in an Apple store. Then you read the manual which is a classic mistranslation to English from Korean. I can’t really complain, because if you asked me to translate English to any other language, I would fail horribly, but still.</p>

<p>The hardware is sleek – nice brushed aluminum, seems super solid, nice strap, really very high quality.</p>

<p>You have to download the Noontang app to your phone – more noontang, hurray! And then download the noontang remote pc server for your mac or pc – even more noontang! Actually finding this was tricky since the company’s website is at www.mediacanvas.net and is 100% Korean. And then download was super slow – I thought Korea had great broadband? Oh of course the Mac app isn’t signed as a known developer so you have to go through the normal hoops to install it.</p>

<p>So next you plug your noontang into your phone audio jack. And fire up the noontang app.</p>

<p>The Noontang phone app is pretty clean. The opening screen lets you connect to the pc. I have no idea if this worked, there is no obvious feedback. In theory then you can advance PPT slides on your PC by a gesture on the phone app but this never seemed to work. And I couldn’t seem to enter a password on either the Mac or the phone, or maybe I did and there is no feedback. No idea.</p>

<p>The other feature then is you can hit the phone app button and the noontang laser lights up so it is a laser pointer. Without a battery as it derives power from the phone. Apparently this works by just getting audio over the phone jack, there are some warnings about not trying to use headphones when the app is running, because it will send laser-generating frequencies and intensities into your ears and melt your brain. Or something.</p>

<p>So anyway, the Noontang. I’ll rent out my Noontang if you want to try my Noontang.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Just-Kids-ebook/dp/B003F1WM2K/">Just Kids</a> by Patti Smith. I’m a rationalist, and I have the faulty assumption that most people think like me. This is a very well written memoir by someone who has a very different worldview, the view of an artist. Not only does the author have different opinions than I do, but she processes the world completely differently, and even perceives the world differently. Really makes me appreciate the breadth of humanity, there are very different ways of experiencing life.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Let-Now-Praise-Famous-ebook/dp/B00DKNDFXI/">Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</a> by Walker Evans and James Agee. A lyrical dive into the lives of poor sharecroppers in the early part of the 20th century. It is hard to imagine how this ever got published the first time around, since the book is very antagonistic to the industry and sponsors who brought it to life. This book is unlike most things you’ve read, a good thing.</li>

    <p>Hey, it was a great day already watching OSU walk all over Purdue and avoid a stumble. The defense was great, the offense was great, that <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1834734-ohio-state-qb-braxton-miller-flips-ball-to-wr-for-a-td-vs-purdue">little ad-hoc flip pass</a> that Braxton threw for a td was glorious.</p>

<p>And then Michigan just put the cherry on the top. You can glory in all the hair-pulling and teeth-gnashing over at <a href="http://mgoblog.com/content/michigan-state-29-michigan-6#comments">mgoblog</a>, but the highlight has to be Michigan’s all time rushing yardage low of -48 yards.

  <h1><a href="/2013/10/29/healthcare-gov-should-be-open-source-now.html">Healthcare.gov should be open source now</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>@bfeld posted an interesting article suggesting that <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/10/healthcaregov-why-didnt-the-white-house-use-wordpress-175764.html#.Um76eHDH0ZF.twitter">Healthcare.gov should have used Wordpress as some state sites did</a>. I don’t have a strong opinion on whether Wordpress would have been appropriate, but I do love the call in the article to opensource the entire healthcare.gov project, advanced by a number of people including <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/10/open-source-and-our-government.html">Fred Wilson</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/developers/">Healthcare.gov developers site</a> claims that the source will be available but <a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/HealthCare.gov-Open-Source-Release">the link to the github project is dead</a>.</p>

<p>The source should go public now. A), it would attract an incredible number of eyes that would be able to highlight the problems both known and unknown. B) it would attract the best and brightest eyes, better than the government can apply in a “tech surge”. C) there are undoubtedly a number of terrible security and privacy bugs in the code, as there are in any large software project, and they would get highlighted and fixed.</p>

<p>And D), the citizens own this code and it should be available to all of us, because we paid for it.</p>

<p>I’d like to see the states go public with their code as well, especially states like Washington where the exchange is working, everyone could benefit from seeing what works.</p>

<p>There is no reason whatsoever to not do this immediately.</p>

<p>UPDATE: there is already a whitehouse.gov petition at http://wh.gov/lD8bf, go sign it!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/10/24/im-not-sure-free-productivity-software-is-such-a-great-thing.html">I'm not sure free productivity software is such a great thing</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/msworks2006.jpg"><img src="images/msworks2006-236x300.jpg" alt="msworks2006" /></a>So now Apple has made OS upgrades free, and more importantly, has made productivity software free. A grab bag of thoughts, none of this is fully formed into a thesis.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Of course none of this is really free, it is buried in the price of your device. Just as Windows prices are generally paid by OEMs. I’m not sure the “free OS upgrade” is remarkable or transformational.</li>
  <li>Free productivity apps are more interesting, maybe. Lots of discussion about how this is a “shot across the bow” at Microsoft, despite the fact that Microsoft already made this move with the Surface. But it isn’t much of a shot across the bow. One, the iWork apps aren’t that great. I’ve never used Pages for more than a second because I don’t write memos or papers so I am not sure what it is for. Numbers feels clumsy on iOS and is incomprehensibly different from XL on OSX. Keynote is the best but has horrible interop with Powerpoint. If you are a Keynote-only user and never have to deal with an inbound PPT presentation, it is OK, but that is a pretty small corner of the market. So I’m not convinced any of this is going to affect Microsoft in the slightest.</li>
  <li>It will be interesting to see how Apple organizationally deals with free software. Already one gets the sense that working on OSX and iWork are not the cool things to be doing inside of Apple. Now OSX and iWork are just cost centers. That is a tough position inside an organization. When teams start to squabble about resources and priorities, a non-revenue cost center doesn’t have a lot of pull, it tends to become a backwater in an organization. Money and talent flows elsewhere.</li>
  <li>We used the phrase “market discipline” inside of Microsoft, I think Paul Maritz was the genesis of this phrase. Setting a price on your product, and having to actually close sales with customers, creates great market feedback and market discipline. It is relatively easy to know if you are making customers happy. You get tons of feedback from customers when something they paid for is not working to their expectations. With iWork in particular, where will the market discipline come from? Already these apps are not best of breed, how are they going to get there?</li>
  <li>For years, Microsoft had a cheap productivity suite available, Works. It was generally sold to PC OEMs and was free to users. It was a fine product. It was positioned as being good enough for home and student users, whereas business professionals would want to pay for Office. Guess how many people want to think of themselves as “not professional, I don’t need Office”?</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE: I’ve had some great conversations with people about this post. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dsobeski/posts/10153383351350008">David Sobeski raises some great points</a>, in particular the importance of making updates free and automatic, anything less is a disservice to customers and a nightmare to manage. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mike.conte">Mike Conte</a> and @Natbro both raise the point that sometimes a cost center can be correctly managed and feel empowered, Mike raises the example of the Audi transmission team who feel like they are part of a winning team. All great points and food for thought.</p>

    <p>Someone saw my Surface this week and shook their head, they assumed I was one of the biggest Microsoft Kool-Aid drinkers ever.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/koolaid.jpg"><img src="images/koolaid-300x199.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/koocbor/" /></a>I actually think the <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2012/10/at-least-the-surface-has-forced-me-to-think-about-what-devices-i-carry/">Surface is kind of a turd</a>. I only have one because it is a part of the conversation in the industry, the conversation about the evolution of Microsoft and its attempts to return to relevance. I don’t know how to participate meaningfully in the industry if I don’t have firsthand knowledge of the products involved. So I have a Surface. I have a PC with Windows 8.1. I’ve tried a Windows Phone relatively recently.</p>

<p>For the same reasons I have an Android phone now, because there is a huge conversation in the industry about Android vs iOS, the differing corporate strategies of Google and Apple. I have a hard time understanding that discussion if I haven’t experienced the Android product directly. Maybe if I was more insightful I wouldn’t need to actually use the product, but for me, the product experience is essential knowledge. I’ve read some stock analysts’ dissections of Apple or Google or Microsoft and their lack of hands-on product experience is obvious at times, which suggests all their analysis is flawed.</p>

<p>And I have a Macbook, and an iPad. I’ll probably get one or both of the next generation consoles. I have an AppleTV and a Google Chromecast. Important to understand the home entertainment experience. Oh and several linux boxes running Ubuntu and Centos. Hard to understand the trends around open source and modern software development if you aren’t living with these. And a Raspberry Pi, and piles of Arduinos, super important to understand the IOT wave and low cost computing. I also use AWS. And Heroku. And Cloud Foundry. And have played with a couple other service options. I’ve tried Azure. And of course the legion of higher level services for developers and devops.</p>

<p>It amuses me when someone sees what I am working with and decides I am an apple zealot or linux fan or windows diehard. What I am is a technology enthusiast, and an industry participant. There may be other paths to remaining smart about the industry, but for me, it is all about hands-on experience with the products.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/10/21/first-bcs-standings-are-out-osu-right-about-where-they-should-be.html">First BCS standings are out, OSU right about where they should be</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bcs3.gif"><img src="images/bcs3.gif" alt="bcs3" /></a><a href="http://sports-ak.espn.go.com/college-football/bcs/_/year/2013">#4 in the first rankings</a>, a fine place to be. A #5 average in the computer polls is a lot better than anticipated (<a href="http://www.cfrc.com/Ratings_2013/WK_8.htm">Billingsley</a> in particular loves the Buckeyes), this past weekend’s carnage cleared out a LOT of riffraff. <a href="http://www.bcsguru.com/">BCS Guru</a> as usual had the standings already correctly forecasted.</p>

<p>OSU’s position is exactly where it has been most of the season – OSU needs to win out, and needs 2 of the 3 above them to get a loss. Which seems very possible, consider the remaining largest challenges for #1-3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bama: LSU, @Auburn, and then an SEC championship game against Missouri?</li>
  <li>FSU: Miami, @Florida (OK maybe Florida is not a challenge this year), ACC Championship game against VT?</li>
  <li>Oregon: UCLA, @Stanford, Oregon State, and then a PAC-12 championship game against ASU? UCLA?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some losses hiding in there for someone.</p>

<p>That said, OSU does not seem like they are the equal of any of these teams right now. Defense is just too weak, particularly the defensive backfield. If Iowa can put 24 on OSU, including tight ends getting behind coverage and outrunning DBs for a TD, well that doesn’t bode well. Still a lot of time left in the season though, plenty of time to get better.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steppenwolf-A-Novel-ebook/dp/B00AQUTONI/">Steppenwolf</a> by Herman Hesse. I love Hesse’s “The Glass Bead Game” and so presumed I’d love this more famous work. But too much droning on and on and on about the nature of the Steppenwolf, and not enough demonstrating his nature through plot and action. I’m a quarter of the way through and I just don’t care anymore, I find myself unable to pick the book up and finish. I will keep it on my desk for a while, hoping that I will be inspired to pick back up.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Everything-Store-Bezos-Amazon-ebook/dp/B00BWQW73E/">The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon</a> by Brad Stone. When I was at Microsoft in the 90s, it was a demanding place to work, but I always felt like I was an “owner”. Company leadership created a culture in which we were expected to think and act like owners, it was partly our company. I don’t know if that culture has continued at Microsoft, but it is how I always felt. Amazon is a great company and has done great things, and seems to have maintained an element of nimbleness that Microsoft may lack now, and I love the customer-first focus of Amazon. But the books leaves the impression that, as an employee, one does not feel like an owner, it is pretty clearly Jeff’s company. I’m not sure I would like working there, although there is a ton to learn from the company, and this book does a great job of letting you stick your nose in the tent.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Smartest-Kids-World-They-ebook/dp/B0061NT61Y/">The Smartest Kids in the World</a> by Amanda Ripley. Great comparative work on world education systems. The lesson seems obvious – rather than punishing our kids with more tests, we should be focusing on raising the bar for teachers. The book yammers on way too long, the core ideas could be in a long magazine article, but interesting nonetheless.</li>

    <p>In the “counting chickens way before they’ve hatched department”, look at the remaining schedule for the Seahawks, Niners, and Saints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seahawks remaining opponents are 20-32 in aggregate. Niners: 24-34. Saints: 26-31. Advantage: Seahawks.</li>
  <li>Seahawks remaining opponents average a little worse than 3rd place in their divisions. Niners and Saints, about midway between 2nd and 3rd. Advantage: Seahawks.</li>
  <li>Seahawks have 4 remaining away games. Niners 6, Saints 5. Advantage: Seahawks.</li>
  <li>Seahawks away games are easier – the opponents have an average 2-4 record. Niners: 2-4, Saints: 3-3. Advantage or Push: Seahawks</li>
</ul>

<p>The Seahawks are benefitting in particular from the Giants and Vikings cratering this year. Has left them with a great opportunity to secure home field advantage throughout the playoffs, which of course for Seattle is a substantial advantage.</p>

<p>Enjoy your NFL weekend!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/10/15/towards-better-public-software-projects.html">Towards better public software projects</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/market.jpg"><img src="images/market-300x195.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brighton/" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lazowska">Ed Lazowska</a> shared some observations about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102433617143638&amp;set=a.983268749488.2650547.10701772&amp;type=1">the failures in some recent large scale public (or quasi-public) software projects</a> – notably <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/us/politics/from-the-start-signs-of-trouble-at-health-portal.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0">the federal health portal</a>. This project, like others, has had a massive budget, and undoubtedly has had hardworking and well-meaning people beavering away on it. And yet is is an operational failure so far.</p>

<p>The discussion on Facebook is worth reading, Ed is a super smart guy and has a set of very smart friends on Facebook. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BenSlivka">Ben Slivka</a> points out that this is not a new pattern, many large scale government IT projects struggle. Ed and others point out it is not just large scale government projects, but large scale commercial projects as well. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rick.rashid">Rick Rashid</a> points out agency problems and also the classic mistake of thinking that a “bespoke” solution is required, that off-the-shelf solutions are just not sufficient – Rick’s comments are very short but well worth reflecting on.</p>

<p>I’ve got some observations up there but I will repeat and expand here. First, there is a dramatic contrast between the economics and quality of this project, and that of internet startup projects. Internet startups survive on a fraction, a small fraction, of the budget allocated to the healthcare portal. And the traffic volumes that the healthcare portal aren’t crazy large, internet startups can scale up to handle these traffic levels reasonably quickly. This suggests that as a society we should try to figure out how to get some of the internet startup mojo applied to the health marketplace portal or other public infrastructure problems. Otherwise all that startup effort is going to be used to serve up animated gifs of cats wearing hats or gosh knows what else.</p>

<p>Second, rather than just trying to learn from internet startups and apply the lessons to a large public software project, perhaps we should create a different structure for these projects that encourages entrepreneurs to work hard on our public projects. Rather than have the government run the whole project, perhaps the government should define the goals and establish prizes, ala the <a href="http://www.xprize.org">XPrize foundation</a>. Rather than committing a priori to a project and plan, let 10 or 100 teams chase the goal, and pick the best at the end of the project. Hand out contracts and award dollars at the end to the best projects and cherry pick the results. Have some consolation awards so that ultimately many teams are motivated to fight their way to the finish line. The government may be better setting goals and handing out awards rather than trying to build it all internally.</p>

<p>There are certainly problems with a prize-driven approach, and some thought needs to be applied to ensure that the most obvious pitfalls are avoided. Having a truly independent panel judge the results will be important. Preventing corruption and influence in the judging process will require some effort. Thinking through the IP issues and ensuring that the resultant IP is appropriately owned would be important. And many others.</p>

<p>We have proven that the way we are engineering these large public systems is costly and not very performant. We should discuss different ways to approach the problem, it seems stupid to keep on doing things the same way.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/10/10/why-is-osx-terminal-so-much-better-than-windows-command-prompts.html">Why is OSX terminal so much better than Windows command prompts?</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/cmdprompt.jpg"><img src="images/cmdprompt-300x225.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n3wjack/" /></a>One of the simple reasons why I do most of my dev work on a Macbook is because OSX terminal windows just work way better than Windows command prompts. Notably for copy paste. I can for instance easily copy a command and paste it and re-execute on OSX, or copy it and paste it into an editor window, etc. The normal system-wide copy/paste keyboard commands just work.</p>

<p>Contrast with Windows, where every terminal window has that stupid edit window, and that stupid Mark command, and stupid paste command with no keyboard equivalent (or none that I know). Even the fancy new powershell prompts still have this same old stupid behaviour. it is the behaviour that the dos box had in Windows 95, probably even Windows 3.x before that. In 20 years it can’t be fixed??</p>

<p>Sorry, just in a grumbly mood this morning.</p>

<p>UPDATE: and hey to be clear I am just sshing from either OSX or Windows into Linux VMs. I don’t give a hoot about the native command line tools, except for needing SSH to be present WHICH WINDOWS SCREWS UP AS WELL. C’mon guys, show some pride in your work.</p>

<p>MORE UPDATE: Sadly the Quick Edit setting mentioned in the comments doesn’t really seem to work. Probably why it is off by default. Supposedly it enables Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V Copy/Paste but it doesn’t seem to work on my Win8 machine. Ctrl-C does something – the current selection in the window is forgotten – but doesn’t seem to put the selection into the clipboard. And Ctrl-V just sends a Ctrl-V to the input line, no change. This is true in both the command prompt and the powershell prompt.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/jsnover">@jsnover</a> nothing irks me more than *nix fanboys slamming CMD.

Wiedower (@CTO_Reed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CTO_Reed/statuses/388349973642764289">October 10, 2013</a></blockquote>

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A brief summary of my daily computing environment: I use an android phone currently, iOS iPads, Osx on laptops, win8 on a desktop machine. I develop software components that target most of the above, as well as various flavors of linux for appliances and cloud hosted environments. On a less frequent basis I use a surface RT that I bought at launch. Each os has its pros and cons, each machine has its merits.</p>

<p>I have no emotional attachment to any os because deep down they aren’t all that differentiated. And I can’t afford the luxury of irrational attachment – I need to target users wherever they are, and I need to use tools that are the most efficient. My own usage, and that of most users, is inherently spread across many vendors and many oses, and I don’t see that changing. Multiplatform and interoperability is just a fact of life.</p>

<p>So when I said wanted ssh, I don’t want something better/different than ssh. I want exactly ssh because I need to connect to a variety of environments and ssh is the only reasonable common denominator. Powershell remoting may be super awesome and wonderful, but it doesn’t solve any problem I have, and just introduces a new non-interoperable tool and protocol with its attendant complexity. Not at all helpful – doesn’t save me time, just creates complexity. I am not saying that Powershell remoting is bad, it just isn’t useful in an inherently multiplatform environment. If your environment is Windows only, then by all means embrace Powershell if that works for you.</p>

<p>And when I say I want easy copy/paste, I don’t want copy/paste with some completely different keyboard and mouse interface. Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V and Cmd-C/Cmd-V have become second nature to me, I have a lot of muscle memory built up around those. Giving me copy/paste using some other keyboard interface or mouse interface is not very helpful (nor is command window text selection that works on blocks instead of lines). I don’t need or value innovation in the copy/paste interface, it doesn’t make me more productive.</p>

<p>So for those reasons, for me, OSX is substantially better than Windows as a development tool today. Which frustrates me because these are stupid little reasons, and there is no reason why Windows couldn’t add these features, it would only make Windows more valuable, and would make my life better. And frustrates me because I still have some affinity for Microsoft, and these seem like such petty features over which to alienate developers. If I was in charge, I’d make sure Windows was excellent at modern cross-platform devops, as well as having Windows-centric features. I can’t see the negative in this.</p>

    <p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bc.png"><img src="images/bc.png" alt="bc" /></a>We are getting close to the first BCS rankings and <a href="http://www.bcsguru.com/bcs_standings.htm">the projections</a> clearly identify OSU’s problem – the computers hate them, and they hate the rest of OSU’s opponents. Without a lot of help OSU will be on the outside looking in, even if OSU takes care of business throughout the season. OSU is certainly going to be stuck behind the ACC champ and the Pac12 champ if those teams are undefeated, so OSU needs to remain undefeated and hope those champs have 1 loss.</p>

<p>So this weekend, while OSU is enjoying it’s bye, here is the OSU fan’s viewing guide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BC at Clemson, 1230pm, ABC/ESPN2. Unfortunately I don’t think BC is very good so I have to cheer for Clemson to have one of those days where nothing goes right. Probably not happening.</li>
  <li>UW vs Oregon, 1pm, Fox Sports 1. (Why is this game relegated to Fox Sports 1?) Big rivalry game, these schools don’t like each other. Oregon is awash in Nike money and, in the eyes of Washington fans, is the most corrupt school yet to be caught cheating. The Huskies looked very good against Stanford. Oregon has been running up numbers against hapless opponents. Here is hoping that Oregon trips over their first taste of adversity.</li>
  <li>Stanford at Utah, 3PM, Pac12 Network. Utah is a credible team, Stanford might have a letdown after UW game, it is Stanford’s first tough road game. Certainly reasons to hope for the upset</li>

I can get 3/4s of a day of solid use on a charge, and I am always in the car a little bit each day (with car charger), and so I am generally making it a full day. Much happer.</li>
  <li>As many people have pointed out, the touchscreen is just not as good as the iphone. Fewer pixels, worse software, I don’t know, but it is just not as good.</li>
  <li>Fragmentation has real impacts. I’ve tried to change usage tips with other Android users, and simple things are moved around in the UI from OEM to OEM. Or carrier to carrier. Just stupid on everyone’s part.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m going to probably root the phone in the next couple weeks and see if I can’t get a clean Android build on and see if that improves the fragmentation point. Good tips up on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2456">xda dev</a></p>
