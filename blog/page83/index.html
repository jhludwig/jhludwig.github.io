    <p>Per <a href="http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/natlRank.jsp?div=4&amp;rpt=IA_teamrushdef&amp;site=org">the NCAA stats site</a>, OSU is #1 in rushing defense. And against good quality opposition.

  <h1><a href="/2005/09/20/ncaa-hypocrisy.html">NCAA hypocrisy</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Nice commentary on <a href="http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2005/Columnists/Fiu/COW/Cavalcade_of_Whimsy.htm">collegefootballnews.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Coaches can go from one team to another without having to sit out a year. Students can transfer from one college to another without any sort of a penalty. It’s time the repressive NCAA realizes how unfair it is to its employees, er, student-athletes and allow them to transfer as well if they choose to. If a player doesn’t like the school he’s at, he should be able to leave at any time without penalty. Go ahead, raid away. If a coach doesn’t like this idea, then he should make sure his school and program are good enough to keep the players. As far as the coaches of the “Katrina schools”, if you really care about your players, you’ll let them do what’s in their best interest, not yours. And to the NCAA, it is possible to make exceptions to the rules and use some actual judgment when it’s time to do the decent thing</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hypocrisy of the adults involved with college sports sickens me. Love the games, love the kids, but some of the adults, well…</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/09/19/recent-books-5.html">Recent Books</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Dipped into the nonfiction pool recently:</p>

<p>* “Confessions of an Economic Hit Man”:amazon. OK I don’t doubt parts of the premise here – the developed nations of the western world use economics to influence and control happenings in the less developed countries. And when economics fail, they sometimes use other means. Duh. This is the way the world has worked approximately forever. I am not sure what he is blowing the whistle on. But Perkins is a blowhard. Puts himself in the middle of all the major happenings of the 20th century. Uses the word “I” all the time. Not much acknowledgement to any teams. It seems almost pathological, and the author drops hints about problems in his personal life, you get the sense he has a real pathology here. And he did this job he hates – extending the western world’s economic dominance over the rest of the world – for years and let himself be bought at every turn. Even when he showed signs of a conscience, he jumped back into the job with both arms, at one point claiming “if I didn’t do it, someone else would.” Wow now that is a standup guy. You get the sense he wrote this book now for fame or money or both, not out of some real sense of altruism.</p>

<p>* “The New Normal”:amazon. Here I thought this was a business book, given the author. But really it is a self help book (I haven’t dipped into this genre since <a href="http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=36&amp;ti=26,36&amp;Search_Arg=dyer%2C+wayne&amp;Search_Code=NAME_&amp;PID=7605&amp;CNT=25&amp;HC=39&amp;SEQ=20050919161222&amp;SID=2">Wayne Dyer burst on the market in the 70s</a>). A lot of economic observations but really this is all about taking control of your life. Roger articulates pretty well how technology is giving us even more control, and how your government/employer safety nets are decaying even more (largely out of their control). And how you can and should take the opportunity to grab control of your own life. Great stuff, young people should read this book or something like it. Hat tip to <a href="http://www.ackerley.com/about.htm">chris</a> for the book.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.doortodoor.com/">Door to Door</a> has provided reliable service over the last 3 years but delivery was kind of squirelly this time.

  <h1><a href="/2005/09/16/the-most-boring-weekend-of-big10-football-ever.html">The Most Boring Weekend Of Big10 Football Ever</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK this is the most boring weekend of big 10 football in recent history. The <a href="http://bigten.collegesports.com/sports/m-footbl/big10-m-footbl-body.html">Big 10 itself says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>With eight unbeaten teams and a non-conference record of 18-3, the Big Ten is off to its best start in the last decade.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But boy I beg to differ. With the Iowa, Michigan, and OSU losses last week, the blush is off this rose. And look at some of these stunning matchups this weekend:</p>

<p>* Eastern Michigan at Michigan * Northern Iowa at Iowa * San Diego State at Ohio State * Central Michigan at Penn State * Florida Atlantic at Minnesota</p>

<p>And then there is the that classic: Kentucky at Indiana. Do these states even know what a football looks like? and just no buzz at all around Illinois at Cal and Wisconsin at North Carolina.</p>

<p>The only stories at all this weekend are:</p>

<p>* Purdue’s first real game with a visit to Arizona. A terrible letdown for Purdue if they can’t win this. * Michigan State at ND. Can ND continue to show up strong?</p>

<p>Pretty thin gruel.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/09/12/why-osu-lost.html">Why OSU lost</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK, why did OSU lose to Texas, and why did Texas win?</p>

<p>At a first glance, <a href="http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2005/Columnists/MZ/Week2/IA_Texas_OhioState.htm">Vince Young was the man</a>. He came through early, and he came through late. Along the way he took a beating and still hung in there.</p>

<p>But OSU had many many chances to put this game away – 5 good field goals, 6 attempts. The offense wasn’t a disaster, but it was ultimately not productive enough. The defense and special teams gave the offense the ball in great position all night long, but the offense couldn’t get it in the endzone.</p>

<p>Why? <a href="http://www.bucyrustelegraphforum.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050912/SPORTS/509120313/1006">You can point to Hamby’s bobble of a TD pass in the endzone, you can point to the field goal missed by feet.</a> But these were single plays over the course of a whole game.</p>

<p>The consistent theme was lack of ball movement by the offense. The QBs weren’t bad, although <a href="http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/football/cs-0509120231sep12,1,170147.story?coll=cs-college-print">some feel that settling on one would make a difference</a>. The running game was adequate.</p>

<p>The real problem was failure to make use of the speed of Ted Ginn Jr. and Santonio Holmes. These guys showed on return plays that, when they have a few steps of open field, they can kill a team. But the offense rarely got them the ball with any kind of open field. Invariably they were catching the ball as they were going out of bounds or with a defender’s arms around them. As the <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/football/football.php?story=dispatch/2005/09/12/20050912-D4-01.html">Dispatch says</a>(subscription):</p>

<p>bq. <em>“Rather than worry about how to tackle the elusive Ginn once he had the ball, the Texas defense assigned one or two players to cover him on every down, denying him easy catches and <strong>making him run routes, which he doesn’t do that well.</strong>“</em></p>

<p>To be a great team, OSU needs to figure out how to use the speed of these players. Perhaps the staff needs better plays, perhaps a single QB needs time to settle into the game, but the speed receivers need to get themselves into positions to make big plays.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/09/12/fall-tv-plans.html">Fall TV Plans</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Cleaned out all my old Tivo season passes over the weekend and set up my new plan for this fall. Here’s the lineup:</p>

<p>* Monday: <a href="http://www.fox.com/prisonbreak/">Prison Break</a>, <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Medium/">Medium</a>, <a href="http://www.sho.com/weeds">Weeds</a>. Medium is a holdover from last year. Prison Break is a marginal new add – we don’t think it has found itself yet but we are hoping. Weeds is hilarious. * Tuesday: <a href="http://www.fox.com/house/">House</a>, <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Law_&amp;_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit/index.html">Law&amp;Order SVU</a>. We love the House character, and well SVU is an old favorite. * Wednesday: <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/">Lost</a>. We didn’t get into this last year but will try this year. * Thursday: <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/alias/">Alias</a>, <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/without_a_trace/">Without a Trace</a>. Alias an old favorite, and the characters in Without a Trace have grown on us. * Friday: nothing. DVD night! * Saturdays: NCAA Football. * Sunday: <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/without_a_trace/">Desparate Housewives</a>. Total brain candy.</p>

<p>We’ll sample My Name is Earl, Everybody Hates Chris, The Apprentice:Martha Stewart based on the buzz for the first two, and well we are just curious about the reinvention of Martha.</p>

<p>Later in the season we’ll pick up 24 and The Sopranos.</p>

<p>Shows that didn’t make the list: numb3rs (we sampled last year but the pseudo-math babble annoys us), other law and order shows (we just don’t like the characters as much), malcolm ( a long time favorite but you can’t see it all), the apprentice (we’re tired of the donald), entourage (boring), cold case (we just never got hooked), smallville (we used to love this show but last season was a disaster).</p>

<p>Even with Tivo time compression, we watch way too much TV.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/09/11/texas-25-osu-22.html">Texas 25, OSU 22</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Great game, tough loss. I am a Vince Young believer now. As is the entire state of Ohio. I am also an A. J. Hawk believer, but then I was before the game.</p>

<p>Obviously OSU’s failure to convert on turnovers cost them the game. From my seat, I felt the offense had good balance. QB play was OK. The running game was OK. Where the team failed is getting the ball into the hands of Santonio and Teddy in positions to use their speed. Too often they were catching ball in close coverage or on a sideline or in a situation where they couldn’t get the 1 or 2 steps necessary to use their speed as a weapon. Seems like we needed more crossing routes, more option pitches, more plays designed to get these guys the ball when they are at speed. Their performance on returns certainly shows that these guys can hurt an opponent when they have just a little room to run.</p>

<p>You have to say tho that OSU is certainly just a hair’s breadth away from Texas in terms of ranking. A loss in September to the #2 team is not a terrible blow to national title aspirations. OSU won’t fall that far in the rankings and they will have time to make it up.</p>

I think what I was really trying to say is Google is finally figuring out how to be sticky. They are providing a platform now that hundreds of apps are using.

  <h1><a href="/2005/09/11/gaming-pcs-2.html">Gaming PCs</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>So <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/08/31/gaming_pc_off_the_shelf.html">rich looked at some gaming pcs recently</a> – the big brands of alien, voodoo, and falcon nw. I’m in the market soon for a new pc and looked at their sites. On the way, A9 and Google pointed me towards some other contenders: <a href="http://www.hypersonic-pc.com/2001/index.asp">Hypersonic</a> in New York, and <a href="http://www.widowpc.com/">WidowPC</a> in Texas – the Widow guys are particularly aggressive at trying to get gaming pc search traffic.</p>

<p>And PC Mag mentions <a href="http://www.abspc.com/index.asp">ABS</a> and <a href="http://www.velocitymicro.com/index.php">Velocity Micro</a> as options.</p>

<p>The Widow systems seem to have the most extreme config options. I’m tempted to try them.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/09/07/helping-hurricane-victims.html">Helping Hurricane Victims</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I sure hope that all the bloggers, who have so much time and energy to blast the emergency preparedness and emergency response of our various levels of government, have spent just as much time and energy actually trying to help the victims of this disaster.</p>

<p>Kudos to everyone who has helped. We gave at the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">American Red Cross</a>. <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/">CharityNavigator</a> has some other ideas as well. I understand <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/hurricanekatrina/2002474637_evacuees06m.html">some refugees are coming to the northwest</a> and we’ll look for ways to help them as well.</p>

<p>I don’t know how effective our government response has been and I personally don’t care to dig into that right now. First job is to help people. None of us should expect the government to solve the problem, that is not the way the world works.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/09/07/fanblogs-poll-up.html">Fanblogs poll up</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Latest <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/fanblogs_xiv/005643.php">fanblog poll up</a>:</p>

<p>1. Southern California (11) 167 2. Texas (1) 155 3. Ohio St. 126 4. Tennessee 108 5. LSU 97 6. Michigan 96 7. Virginia Tech 95 8. Iowa 83 9. Georgia 82 10. Florida 53 11. Florida St. 52 12. Louisville 46 13. Arizona St. 19 14. Notre Dame 18</p>

<p>OK I am biased but I think this poll is a lot more valid than the Coaches’ or Writers’ polls. The Fanblogs folks (me included) actually see a lot of these games, certainly we see way more than the Coaches do.</p>
