    <p>I don’t know what R-67 is, but I’ve seen this group – <a href="http://www.reject67.org/" title="Reject R-67">Consumers Against Higher Insurance Rates</a> – running numerous inflammatory ads against it. Google reveals that one of these “consumers” is <a href="http://www.pdc.wa.gov/rptimg/Default.aspx?docid=1044692">State Farm</a>, who has given $284K to the campaign. Another is <a href="http://www.insurancenewsnet.com/article.asp?a=top_news&amp;id=84581">Professional Insurance Agents of Washington</a>. Here’s <a href="http://www.reject67.org/who.html">the whole list</a> – note that it is free for individuals to join, and they have a damn small list. And I wonder how many of these are employees/members of the insurance industry companies/groups?</p>

<p>The duplicity of this campaign pretty much convinces me to vote for R-67, whatever it is.</p>

<p>UPDATE: OK I don’t know why this ticks me off so much, something about these monied interests wrapping themselves in the cloak of consumerism. You can browse all the <a href="http://hera.pdc.wa.gov/wx/showResults.asp?AppName=PDC&amp;AppDesc=PDC%20FILINGS&amp;ShowThumbs=False&amp;MaxDisplay=50&amp;SortOrder=&amp;ShowDocId=True&amp;PromptForCheckOut=False&amp;nFirstRecord=1&amp;SortField='&amp;SearchCriteria=%257E%257Efield9%3Don%26REPORT%2BTO%3D%26strAppName%3DPDC%26DESCRIPTION%252FPARTY%3D%26filt%3Dtrue%26%257E%257Efield5%3Don%26FORM%2BTYPE%3D%26ELECTION%2BYEAR%3D%26%257E%257Efield1%3Don%26BALLOT%2BNUMBER%3D%26%257E%257Efield15%3Don%26%257E%257Efield16%3Don%26FILER%2BNAME%3DList%253A%2B%2527CONSUMERS%2BAGAINST%2BHIGHER%2BINSURANCE%2BRATES%2527%26%257E%257Efield8%3Don%26LEGISLATIVE%2BDISTRICT%3D%26%257E%257Efield3%3Don%26%257E%257Efield4%3Don%26OFFICE%2BSOUGHT%3D%26%257E%257Efield6%3Don%26DATE%2BRECEIVED%3D%26REPORT%2BFROM%3D%26%257E%257Efield7%3Don%26Submit%2BCriteria%2Bfor%2BQuery%3DSend%2BQuery%26&amp;batchnumber=">group’s filings here</a> – you will quickly see that real washington consumers have donated maybe $300 while insurance companies (mostly out of state) have donated millions and millions of dollars to this campaign.

    <p>* “The Night Gardener”:amazon by George Pelecanos. Lots of fancy blurbs, but a weak first half. The characters grew on me, but the setting never came to life. The ending was satisfyingly ambiguous. So an OK read but not my favorite. * “Silence”:amazon by Thomas Perry. Good pacing and situations, well written, but I didn’t like the characters. * “A Great Deliverance”:amazon by Elizabeth George. Great atmosphere, a twisted tale of family and love and hate and sin, detectives who are struggling with their own deep issues – an awesome tale. Very good, I am late to the party on this author. * “The world Without Us”:amazon by Alan Weisman. My one dip into nonfiction. Interesting descriptive essay of our various impacts on the planet and how they will dissipate over time. Not very prescriptive. My own take away is that plastics are the worst thing we are doing to the globe – they are pervasive, long-lived, and there is no good way to scrub them out of the environment.</p>

<p>• The computer stops responding, and you receive a “Display driver stopped responding and has recovered” error message. You can restart the computer only by pressing the computer’s power button. • The computer stops responding or restarts unexpectedly when you play video games or perform desktop operations. • There are stability issues with some graphics processing units (GPUs). These issues could cause GPUs to stop responding (hang). • Visual appearance issues occur when you play graphics-intensive games.</p>
