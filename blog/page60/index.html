Amazon says 3 stars but very bimodal, you either love or hate this book. * “Family Planning”:amazon by Karan Mahajan. Tale of maturation of eldest son and father in a huge family.

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">25 April 2009</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>* “The Atrocity Archives”:amazon by Charles Stross. Stross writes a good tale and this is a fine story, collision of witchcraft and information tech. It is one of Stross’s earliest works and a bit choppy in parts (was originally serialized I believe) but still adequate fun. Amazon gives this one 4.5 stars, I would tend a little lower – say 3.5 stars. * “The Years”:amazon by Virginia Woolf. I guess I am not sophisticated enough for this book. I found it to be a shambling wreck. I didn’t care about the people, the times, the situation. The choppy style was unreadable. I gave up 1/4 of the way through. Amazon gives this 4.5 stars too tho with few user ratings, I would give it a 1 star. People are too enamored with the author’s name. * “Pierre and Jean”:amazon by Guy de Maupassant. Sin, shame, betrayal, remorse, sacrifice, blame, loss, a bit of redemption. A great little story of human foibles and the prisons we make in our own minds. Unlike the Woolf above, I’d happily read another de Maupassant. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I’d agree. * “Days Between Stations”:amazon by Steve Erickson. Pour yourself a big mug of absinthe and settle in with this one. Intriguing but strange. Amazon gives it 4.5 stars though not heavily reviewed. I’m probably a little lower but it is an intriguing book.</p>

It is one of Stross’s earliest works and a bit choppy in parts (was originally serialized I believe) but still adequate fun. Amazon gives this one 4.5 stars, I would tend a little lower – say 3.5 stars. * “The Years”:amazon by Virginia Woolf. I guess I am not sophisticated enough for this book. I found it to be a shambling wreck. I didn’t care about the people, the times, the situation. The choppy style was unreadable. I gave up 1/4 of the way through. Amazon gives this 4.5 stars too tho with few user ratings, I would give it a 1 star. People are too enamored with the author’s name. * “Pierre and Jean”:amazon by Guy de Maupassant. Sin, shame, betrayal, remorse, sacrifice, blame, loss, a bit of redemption. A great little story of human foibles and the prisons we make in our own minds. Unlike the Woolf above, I’d happily read another de Maupassant. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I’d agree. * “Days Between Stations”:amazon by Steve Erickson. Pour yourself a big mug of absinthe and settle in with this one. Intriguing but strange. Amazon gives it 4.5 stars though not heavily reviewed. I’m probably a little lower but it is an intriguing book.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>On the first page, apps I use every day, multiple times:</p>

<p>* Some of the default Apple apps – Mail, Text, Calendar, Safari (all on the bottom row); Weather, Stocks, Maps, Camera, Calculator (a recent promotion back to the first page, the landscape mode scientific calculator is handy now that I am taking courses at UW again), Settings (purely to switch radio on/off for flights), Clock (for alarm and cooking timing), Phone. * Facebook, Tweetie, Todo (synched with rememberthemilk for todo list management), Tripit (awesome for quick access to trip details – flight status, checkin codes, etc), Wordpress for blogging, Amazon.com. OK Amazon is probably going to fall off soon, I don’t do that much ordering while on the iphone. * 2 Across for nytimes crosswords, and Mafia Wars. Mafia Wars is fun tho the math in the game is kind of whack.</p>

<p>On the second page – apps that i need regular access to, or apps that I am trying out:</p>

<p>* App Store, Shazam (tagging music that I hear on the radio/etc), SmugShot (for access to my photos), MiGhtyDocs (google docs access) * Kayak and Flight Update tho they are declining is use thanks to the Tripit app * Pandora tho also declining in use as I am getting new music via other mechanisms * Trying out: Yelp, Air Sharing, SimpleMindX, FS5 Hockey, FriendCast, fring.</p>

<p>On the third page – apps I keep around because I have to or because I need them occasionally:</p>

<p>* Apple default apps Notes, Contacts, Photos, iTunes, iPod, YouTube. Can’t delete them, they have to go somewhere * Urbanspoon, GuitarToolkit – great apps but I don’t currently use that often. I tend to use google maps for finding restaurants instead of urban spoon * Wine Guide, Starmap, Drinks Free, Clinometer, Remote, Google Earth, RTM, Snaptell. All interesting but I rarely find a reason to use. RTM is just not as good as the Todo app</p>

<p>On the fourth page – games that I liked at one point but that are basically ignored now:</p>

<p>* Tetris, Trism, Bejeweled 2. I’ll still play bejeweled every once in a while * Vector Tanks, iShoot. * Pb Dreams, Flick Bowling, Monkey Ball, XOFootball. * Edge, touchPhysics, Koi Pond, Topple, Rolando, newtonica2. All cute. * Black and White. Pretty poor Othello game. * Dr. Awesome. Awesome actually.</p>
