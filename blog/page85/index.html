    <p>Article about <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/pioneerpress/news/local/12157427.htm">online colleges</a> – you can get real phds from places like <a href="http://www.waldenu.edu">walden</a> and capella and <a href="http://www.nova.edu">nova</a>. Early days yet but I am betting these programs grow in popularity and quality – the traditional college system just doesn’t work that well for someone in their 30s or 40s who wants to learn new skills or refresh their education. Personally I thought about going back and getting a PhD after I left Microsoft, but the structure of a traditional program is designed for young people with lots of free time and no other responsibilities. Just doesn’t fit my life that well.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/07/27/reads-this-week.html">Reads this week</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “Crossworld”:amazon by marc romano is a dive into the world of crosswords – the people in the “industry”, their motivations, marc’s own motivations. I am a compulsive crossworder and I got something out of this book – a little bit of background on leading characters. But marc spends too much time discussing and rationalizing his own interest in crosswords, and not enough diving into the stories, behaviours, and anecdotes of others in the industry. It reads as if he did a modest amount of research, had enough material for a long essay, and then bloated it up with a lot of navel gazing. So some value in the book but not a homerun. * “One shot”:amazon by Lee Child is a classic airport book rack thriller. A lone wolf ex-military investigator uncovers and breaks up a massive criminal conspiracy thanks to his unbelievable physical skills and powers of detection. He is three steps ahead of everyone else in the story and just seems to be toying with them. This is not a unique plot, half the thrillers on the airport book stands could be summed up the same way. This story has very nice pacing, an interesting situation, and is better than most. It’d make a great movie script. * “California girl”:amazon by T. Jefferson Parker is a great mystery. Deep characters with deeply intertwined lives. A stark contrast with the prior book – California Girl is a memorable story with memorable characters that altogether makes a great book, but way too complex to ever be a movie. One Shot is an adequately entertaining book but would be a killer summer movie.</p>

    <p>Per the pros, <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005313.php">the Buckeyes have 7-1 odds of being the national champs</a>, behind only USC.</p>

<p>OK I love the Buckeyes, but their line play was not all that strong last season, <a href="http://www.collegefootballnews.com/Big_Ten/2005_Previews/2005_BigTen_Unitrankings.htm">and per at least one ranking</a>, they are not as strong as several of the other contenders in the Big10 this year. On either side of the line.</p>

<p>I have a hard time believing that the relative lack of line strength will result in the top finish in the Big 10, let alone the BCS.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/07/12/vacation-reading.html">Vacation Reading</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “Once An Eagle by Anton Myrer”:amazon. Had this on the shelf since reading <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000994.html">Absolutely American</a>. Purportedly one of the most popular novels at west point. A rousing tale following an infantryman from WW1 thru vietnam. Tends to glamorize military life and demonize all other careers, also denigrates spouses who don’t support the life fully. How do I feel about our armed forces after reading? A lot about honor in here but too much demonization of all other roles in society, and a little too much glorification of the warrior. * “Natural History by Justina Robson”:amazon. The old “encounter with alien artifact/culture which exposes the true nature of the universe” tale, but future potential variations of the human form and their attendant character implications are explored nicely. * “The Mill on the Floss”:amazon by Eliot. What great, fallible, deeply human characters. No supermen here, just people bumbling through life.</p>

    <p>So had to relearn a bunch of cabin life skills from my youth over the last two weeks:</p>

<p>* Power and heat. where is the propane turn on for the cabin? for the stove? for the grill? How do I check propane supply? Who do we get propane from? * What is that munching sound in the wall? What do we do about it? * Securing a boat. Installing an engine lock, storing the gas can and gas line separately during our absence, hiding the kill switch. Not a deterrent to a determined thief but the casual thief will be frustrated. * Saltwater, 4-cycle engine maintenance. New to me, I grew up with 2-cycle Evinrudes. Flushing with fresh water, checking oil, spraying the engine to keep salt from getting a foothold. * Garbage disposal. The joys of hauling your own trash to the dump. As someone on the island said, the dump is the great equalizer, sooner or later everyone has to go there.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/06/24/books-624.html">Books 6/24</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve been intrigued forever by a couple of phrases that have entered the vocabulary and so I finally read:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0192835505/qid=1119675524/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-1551338-7422408?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">She by H. Rider Haggard</a>. I’ve always wondered about the origin of “She-who-must-be-obeyed.” A classic adventure yarn with moments of brilliance. And who can pass on a book with a jacket blurb by Freud: “a strange book…full of hidden meaning.” * “Catch-22 by Joseph Heller”:amazon. I knew the reputation of this book, but I didn’t realize it was such extreme farce. A little offputting at first, but I got sucked in. And the last couple chapters really slam the book home for me, as some of the farcical elements are left behind and you are forced to confront the realities of war. A timely read.</p>

<p>Oh and <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/06/me_and_books.html">some book pointers over on marginal revolution</a>, always looking for more suggestions.</p>

<p>* Online reviews and rankings of doctors and hospitals. * Information and breaking news about medical ailments and treatments. * Software and tools that let people manage their medical records online. * Health “concierges” or “coaches” who help patients navigate the medical system. * Walk-in medical clinics where, say, in 15 minutes and for $39, you can discover whether your child has an ear infection.</p>

    <p>Hit <a href="http://www.attrition.ws/76/">Tiger Mountain</a> this morning for a hike. It is a nice area and incredibly convenient – maybe too convenient as it was quite crowded particularly at lower elevations, and the trails are pretty beat. But a gorgeous morning so I can’t complain.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="http://www.theludwigs,com/video/outdoors/GoodMorning.TigerMountain.061905.wmv">my good morning video</a> (3Meg), about 500 feet up from the trail head. And a little later on, on the backside of Tiger Mountain, <a href="http://www.theludwigs,com/video/outdoors/WalkingForDoughnuts.TigerMountain.061905.wmv">walking and thinking about doughnuts</a> (7Meg), the logical conclusion of any hike.</p>

  <h1><a href="/blog/2005/06/19/per-category-xml-feeds.html">Per Category XML Feeds</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve added per-category XML feeds to my blog – helpful guidance at <a href="http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/000458simple_rss_customizations.php">Learning Movable Type</a>. They are all at www.theludwigs.com/archives/.xml.</p>

<p>So what? Well now I can create meaningful tagclouds for my categories. I’ve got one for the <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/theludwigs/default/50">most recent posts for the whole blog</a>. But more interestingly I’ve got one <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwighalloween/default/50">for just my halloween postings</a> – this gives a great sense of what topics dominate my halloween category, what themes are most popular. And is a nice way to autogenerate tags and hierarchy for the category – I don’t have to do any work! I’ve just added one for <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwigbooks/default/50">my book posts as well</a> (not yet updated) and <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwigsoftware/default/50">my software posts</a> (also not yet updated).</p>

<p>Now it would be even cooler if i could yoke tinyurl functionality to this, so that you could ask for the page www.theludwigs.com/faulkner or www.theludwigs.com/books/faulkner and my site would find the tag in a tagcloud and return the relevant page. Some people have posted <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=374">sample tinyurl clone code in response to ed’s posting</a>, in my copious free time i may look at this. I want my own tinyurl functionality anyway for other reasons.</p>
