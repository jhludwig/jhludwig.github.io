  <h1><a href="/2004/01/05/kvms-with-audio.html">KVMs with Audio</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’m trying to find a good KVM with Audio for home use. I’ve started with this – <a href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&amp;Section_Id=201729&amp;pcount=&amp;Product_Id=160623" title="Welcome to Belkin - OmniView™ SOHO Series KVM Switch with Audio, USB and VGA">Belkin OmniView SOHO Series KVM Switch with Audio, USB and VGA</a> – and while it works largely as promised, it has some real drawbacks. The video and audio switching are fine. But the keyboard/mouse/usb switching is troubled – the box is basically a USB 1.x hub which is switched back and forth between machines. And this creates some problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is usb 1.x and not usb 2.0 which creates all kinds of annoying error messages because I have downstream usb 2.0 devices.</li>
  <li>the usb hub introduces latency in kb/mouse interactions which is at time noticeable in games.</li>
  <li>the hub just plain drops some kb input – for instance if you hold down the control key for more than 5 seconds, the hub forgets. really bad if you are trying to select a lot of messages in your inbox for instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>So i can’t recommend this box. I may try the PS2 model and see if it improves the latency and keyboard problems – it may since i think the ps2 switching is just an electrical switching and doesn’t try to get fancy with a usb hub. What I’d really like tho is a usb2.0 based kvm with low latency and no keyboard drops. Google points toward some <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=usb+2.0+kvm">usb2.0 kvms</a> but they don’t have audio. Maybe i should just get one of these kvms and have a separate switch for audio?</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/12/29/10000-rpm-wd-drive.html">10,000 RPM WD drive</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Built a shuttle this weekend with a <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/current/retailkits/wd360gdrtl.asp" title="WD Raptor 36 GB 10,000 RPM ESATA Hard Drive Kit - WD360GDRTL">WD Raptor 36 GB 10,000 RPM ESATA Hard Drive Kit - WD360GDRTL</a> as it’s boot drive – a nearly 40% improvement in speed over your standard 7200 rpm drive. Wow it makes a huge difference, I am very happy!</p>

<p>Training XP to use a SATA drive as a boot drive was a little tricky – involving:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing a SATA PCI card – I had a maxtor (promise-based) card that came free with another hard drive so I used that. Installed fine, tho XP has no drivers for it, but the drivers on the CD were certified</li>
  <li>Connecting up the WD drive. This was confusing. The drive end of the SATA cable was a 15 pin power-carrying connector, and the documentation warned many times about NOT connecting the standard 4-pin drive power connector if you were using a 15-pin connector. However, on the PCI card end, the SATA cable was data-only, and it was clearly not delivering power to the drive. I wasted time here until I finally just connected a spare 4-pin drive power connector and everything worked</li>
  <li>Getting confused by XP, which was looking for some Promise SATA driver, but finally just ignoring this error message after reading some forums which said it was harmless</li>
  <li>Running the included WD utilities to copy all my files from my old IDE boot drive over to the SATA drive, and setting the SATA drive to be a boot drive.</li>
  <li>But of course the utility didn’t really set the SATA drive up to be a boot drive, you have to muck around in the BIOS to do that, enabling SCSI boot as SATA masquerades as SCSI at this level of the system</li>
</ul>

<p>But it all works now and it is great!</p>

    <p>We’ve played a lot of games over the holiday. Our grades:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.callofduty.com/index.asp" title="Activision: Call Of Duty">Call Of Duty</a>: A+. Multiplayer incredibly fun, servers easy to connect to, firewalls not a problem. The only real beef is the stupid bunny-hopping behaviour that some players adopt to avoid incoming fire.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Counterstrike</a>: A-. Great multiplayer gameplay. But aged graphics, ridiculously painful downloading required to get up and going, and confusing game lobby behaviour.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/">Halo for PC</a>. B+. Fun, not a bad way to spend time. But just doesn’t seem to have the same addictiveness of Call of Duty or Counterstrike.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.easportsbig.com/games/ssx3/home.jsp">SSX 3</a>. B+. OK we are suckers for snowboarding games. This is a reasonable next version of the SSX line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.xiii-thegame.com/uk/virtualtour/">XIII</a>. C+. A great idea and a good story line. But incredibly stupid save game behaviour makes the single player missions painful – needless repetition of solved missions is no substitute for real challenge. Oh and the end of level bosses are juvenile, making the game feel like a Mario title.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hidden-and-dangerous.com/hd2/index.aspx?bhcp=1">Hidden and Dangerous 2</a>. C-. A nice looking game, but so realistic that the fun is sapped out of it. Yes I am sure a single shot from that gun would really take me out of commission, but a fun game needs to be a little more forgiving.</p>

Why all the hoopla over oil? What about electronics independence, or timber, or food, or any other good we happen to import? And do we think more government involvement in the energy market will make it more efficient? And do the numbers even work out, could we realistically and economically ever be energy independent? I just think this is a weird platform plank to pin your hopes on. It may be a good thing to do but it has no emotional resonance with me.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/12/22/making-pcs-as-easy-as-tvs.html">Making PCs as easy as TVs</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>For a long time I’ve thought that I was unlikely to ever put a PC in my family room next to the TV, because a PC was so unfriendly. And the PC really hasn’t gotten a lot better.</p>

<p>But I read this article – <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,1417555,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532" title="Easy as a TV">Easy as a TV</a> – and my recent experience adding HDTV, a PVR, a new DVD player, and a media receiver to my family room is starting to warm me up to the idea of a PC in the room.</p>

<p>While a PC is still a pain in the ass to use, the aggregate user interface of my home-theatre receiver, dvd player, pvr, media receiver, game box, etc is WAAAY worse than any PC experience. The inconsistent terminology across devices, modality, crappy remotes, etc – I can’t imagine how regular human beings ever make all this stuff work. I could drop in a PC and wipe out the need for a dvd player, pvr, media receiver, game box, etc. And a nicely done integrated PC could have a much more consistent UI across all these.</p>

<p>I think the real challenge here is for the CE industry to realize that they are on the brink of being wiped out by general purpose computing platforms, and getting their act together quick to simplify the experience for traditional CE equipment. Or the battle will be over.</p>

One from a guy I don’t know that well and who has only a modest number of connections – the benefits in our connection may flow mostly to him. And one from a guy I know perhaps a little better, and who is very well connected – the benefits in our connection may flow more to me. Accept both? Neither? Split the hairs and accept the guy who I know a little better and who has substantially more benefit for my network connectedness? I am very confused about what the criteria should be for accepting connections as I know most people are. A LinkedIn connection is so binary…</p>
