				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/yet-another-collaboration-startup">Yet Another Collaboration Startup</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">02 July 2003</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I was looking at the plans of yet another collaboration startup this week. Yet another interesting system to help people codify and automate collaboration. And yet another system that will die an unmourned death I suspect.</p>

<p>End users have voted over and over again in favor of ad-hoc collaboration tools – email, IM. We happily bounce messages back and forth to collaborate. But make us structure it just a little bit and we overwhelmingly reject the solution. We are just too impatient and short-term lazy to create a structured message, to use a more structured workflow tool, to do the upfront design work to create a collaboration app.</p>

<p>The same dynamic exists with spreadsheets and databases. The dominant use for spreadsheets is simple lists with some modest calculations. Databases would be perfect for this but we use spreadsheets because we can jump right in with no upfront design time, we don’t have the patience to do a little design upfront.</p>

<p>But I wonder if we can’t do a little better in email, perhaps drawing some inspiration from spreadsheets. When I collaborate in email, I am often making a list – a meeting agenda, a list of tasks we need to do, a list of questions we need answers to, a list of assignments. And then I’d love it if I could easily see status against that list. It would be nice if my email editting app would auto-recognize lists, and then track responses and status to list items, letting me see a summarized view of the list of items being discussed in a thread.</p>

<p>It has to be really lightweight, any list should be autorecognized and formatted, as Word does today if you try to create a list of items.</p>

<p>Just early thinking. I’d like to see some lightweight collaboration grow up from simple email, rather than continue to see heavyweight groupware software.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/partitioning-of-processing-power">Partitioning of processing power</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">02 July 2003</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I’ve been wondering a lot about the practical implications of the partitioning of processing power on the PC.</p>

<p>I’ve been dutifully buying machines with faster and faster <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/roadmap/index.htm?iid=ipp_browse process_roadmap&amp;" title="Intel? Products - Processor Roadmap">Intel processors</a>, I even bought a dual proc machine, and I have to say – the results have been underwhelming. All this processing power just seems to get sopped up by Windows, Office, all the taskbar cruft that programs and oems install, etc etc. As I have doubled and tripled the power available to me, my life hasn’t gotten a lot better.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I’ve also been adding processing power even faster to my video subsystem as I’ve kept up with the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=products">nvidia</a> and ati product leapfrogs. And I have to say – my computing experience has gotten visibly, materially better over the last 24 months, games are looking better by the month.</p>

<p>And so I have started to wonder about the “right” model for partitioning processing power on the PC platform. I am not wondering in computer science sense. I am wondering at pragmatic, social level. I wonder if creating a pool of dedicated processing power, not generally accessible to general purpose programs, has created an environment in which games have been able to move ahead faster. And I am wondering if keeping this processing power away from the general use pool, away from all the general purpose cruft on my machine, has in fact been the reason that games have been able to take off. If all game processing power was intermingled with the general purpose cpu, would we have seen the same rate of improvement?</p>

<p>I wonder if we wouldn’t be served by more special purpose co-processors. A network/security processor where all the code for firewalling, virus checking, intrusion detection, compression, etc could happen. A reliability coprocessor where dedicated code could be backing up, examining systems for failure, predicting problems, etc.</p>

<p>Certainly not a traditional view of how to evolve the PC but I wonder.</p>

				<p><p>Dave has an idea for a <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/subsHarmonizer" title="In progress: Subscriptions harmonizer">Subscriptions harmonizer</a> so that you can use multiple aggregators. I’d certainly be a customer. I kind of solve it today by using Newsgator which I leave running all the time at work; and then I use Outlook Web Access to browse my aggregated news folders from home. It works ok but it doesn’t let me use arbitrary aggregators at home, or keep sub lists in sync across multiple aggregators.</p>
