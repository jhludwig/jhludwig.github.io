I personally don’t quite get it – within our extended family, everyone has a cell phone with a huge bucket of minutes, they’ve moved their long distance usage to the cell phone, and so their local phone bill has dropped to the basic $20-30/month level.

A great book. I immediately ordered copies and sent to my young relatives. Great, wise counsel on how to live a principled, thoughtful life and not just get drawn into the crowd. And the style chosen makes the material very accessible, despite the many references to sometimes unfamiliar material. Every young ambitious person out to make their mark on the world should read this book.</p>

				<p><p>…I’d focus on the academic market. I have two family members heading to college this fall, and they both need laptops with wifi for their campuses. If this is becoming the default at every major college campus, then we are seeding the market with a huge number of capable machines, a huge number of free hotspots, a user base that is very willing to try new services. What great services could we build to target these users and to help them?</p>

				<p><p>I see that <a href="http://www.raelity.org/archives/computers/internet/weblogs/blosxom/blosxom_2_0.html" title="raelity bytes">Blosxom 2.0</a> has shipped. Claims to have better IIS support than past versions. I wish I had time to try it again because the core design principle – leverage the file system hierarchy as your category hierarchy – is so appealing to me, no new storage system created. As a result, backup, copying, storage management, etc are so much easier. But I just don’t have the time to reimplement the blog again right now. I did play around with previous versions a lot but they were so hard to get working on IIS and NT.</p>
