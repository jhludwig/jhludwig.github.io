				<p><p>Can’t wait for the season to start.</p>

<p>To put a little damper on my enthusiasm tho – <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005403.php">The buckeyes are already #3</a> – in football revenue. <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_05_01__arch_file.htm#111711545198246615">The Sports Economist points out</a> that expenditures don’t seem to correlate strongly with success though. But they don’t negatively correlate with success either.</p>

<p>Either way, about 85 kids are generating $46M in revenue for the school, which is getting used up to support other sports, build nice facilities, and pay some big salaries to adults. I still have a problem with the morality of this, more of the money should flow to the benefit of the players on the team. Some small suggestions – give the players 8 years of free tuition so that they can realistically get an education and play football. Or underwrite the tuition for the children of former players. Fund a modest disability insurance program for the players.</p>

<p>Anyway, kickoff is 17 days away…</p>

				<p><p>* “What’s My Name, Fool?”:amazon is a great collection of writings on sports by Dave Zirin. Zirin writes about the dirty underside of sports – the exploitation of poor uneducated young athletes; racism, sexism, and homophobia; the exploitation of sports by media and by politicians; the grotesque amounts of public monies spent on professional sports. Great great stuff. The histories of Ali, Jackie Robinson, Curt Flood, and others who fought for reform and for justice are illuminating. A very worthy read. * “Cheaper by the Dozen”:amazon – What a wonderful book. The father is an amazing character, the stories are fabulous. A very bittersweet ending, but that serves to make the story more human and authentic. Don’t know how I missed this growing up. * “The Ginger Man”:amazon by J P Donleavy – Horrid. Couldn’t finish. Brutish character, I learned nothing from him. The “Nicholas Baker”:amazon of 40 years ago – horrid little story that doesn’t need to be told. * “Gravity’s Rainbow”:amazon – A lot of interesting references and construction. But ultimately I didn’t care about anything happening in the book and put it down after 100 pages. If you want a farcical wartime book, read Catch-22. * “Keeping Watch”:amazon and “Folly”:amazon by Laurie R King. Wow, great pageturners. Great mysteries, great twists (especially keeping watch), really great characters who you care about. I like these much better than her period mysteries.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">14 August 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Just back from Lopez, great time. Some tips on hiking up there:</p>

<p>Stop by the chamber of commerce office in the village. Get their list of hikes and current directions – it is quite accurate. Many hikes on the island are on DNR land, accessible only by easement over private property – it can be a little tricky. The Chamber of Commerce directions are great.</p>

<p>The best hikes in my view:</p>

<p>* Shark reef. Short. But nice coastline and sealions. Very busy. * Otis Perkins Park. Go at low tide. A long expanse of beach. Probably safe to ignore private property signs. * Chadwick hill. Definitely need those instructions, accessing the trail head is tricky. No one goes here – Trail is rough, rough. But more vertical than most the trails on the island * Iceberg point. Again you need those instructions, tricky to find the trail. Not strenuous but a gorgeous piece of property, sealions, great views, some vertical gain. Lots of sun. This is the best on the island.</p>

				<p><p>Article about <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/pioneerpress/news/local/12157427.htm">online colleges</a> – you can get real phds from places like <a href="http://www.waldenu.edu">walden</a> and capella and <a href="http://www.nova.edu">nova</a>. Early days yet but I am betting these programs grow in popularity and quality – the traditional college system just doesn’t work that well for someone in their 30s or 40s who wants to learn new skills or refresh their education. Personally I thought about going back and getting a PhD after I left Microsoft, but the structure of a traditional program is designed for young people with lots of free time and no other responsibilities. Just doesn’t fit my life that well.</p>

				<p><p>* “Crossworld”:amazon by marc romano is a dive into the world of crosswords – the people in the “industry”, their motivations, marc’s own motivations. I am a compulsive crossworder and I got something out of this book – a little bit of background on leading characters. But marc spends too much time discussing and rationalizing his own interest in crosswords, and not enough diving into the stories, behaviours, and anecdotes of others in the industry. It reads as if he did a modest amount of research, had enough material for a long essay, and then bloated it up with a lot of navel gazing. So some value in the book but not a homerun. * “One shot”:amazon by Lee Child is a classic airport book rack thriller. A lone wolf ex-military investigator uncovers and breaks up a massive criminal conspiracy thanks to his unbelievable physical skills and powers of detection. He is three steps ahead of everyone else in the story and just seems to be toying with them. This is not a unique plot, half the thrillers on the airport book stands could be summed up the same way. This story has very nice pacing, an interesting situation, and is better than most. It’d make a great movie script. * “California girl”:amazon by T. Jefferson Parker is a great mystery. Deep characters with deeply intertwined lives. A stark contrast with the prior book – California Girl is a memorable story with memorable characters that altogether makes a great book, but way too complex to ever be a movie. One Shot is an adequately entertaining book but would be a killer summer movie.</p>
