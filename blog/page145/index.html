				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">19 June 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I’ve added per-category XML feeds to my blog – helpful guidance at <a href="http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/000458simple_rss_customizations.php">Learning Movable Type</a>. They are all at www.theludwigs.com/archives/.xml.</p>

<p>So what? Well now I can create meaningful tagclouds for my categories. I’ve got one for the <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/theludwigs/default/50">most recent posts for the whole blog</a>. But more interestingly I’ve got one <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwighalloween/default/50">for just my halloween postings</a> – this gives a great sense of what topics dominate my halloween category, what themes are most popular. And is a nice way to autogenerate tags and hierarchy for the category – I don’t have to do any work! I’ve just added one for <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwigbooks/default/50">my book posts as well</a> (not yet updated) and <a href="http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwigsoftware/default/50">my software posts</a> (also not yet updated).</p>

<p>Now it would be even cooler if i could yoke tinyurl functionality to this, so that you could ask for the page www.theludwigs.com/faulkner or www.theludwigs.com/books/faulkner and my site would find the tag in a tagcloud and return the relevant page. Some people have posted <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=374">sample tinyurl clone code in response to ed’s posting</a>, in my copious free time i may look at this. I want my own tinyurl functionality anyway for other reasons.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK I can’t leave well enough alone. I have to take every opportunity to turn everyday human experiences into geekfests.</p>

<p>So I got <a href="http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&amp;prod_id=SC-X105L%2fXAA">a Samsung SC-X105 Sports Camcorder</a>, attached the remote lens with the provided straps to my head, and went out yesterday morning. You can see and hear what I saw – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/video/outdoors/Waterfall.CougarMountain.061705.wmv">a little waterfall</a> (1 Meg), <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/video/outdoors/TreeCover.CougarMountain.061705.wmv">a nice tree covered trail</a> (2 Meg), <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/video/outdoors/Ribs.CougarMountain.061705.wmv">griping about my ribs</a> (2 Meg), and <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/video/outdoors/BagleySeam.CougarMountain.061705.wmv">the Bagley Seam trail</a> (6 Meg).</p>

<p>These videos are “sports videos” – you see it as I did it, handsfree video shooting, so very jerky and hopping all over the place. The camera is a great fun toy tho some serious aggravations as noted by other reviewers – you have to keep telling it to use the external remote lens every time you turn it on, it doesn’t remember this setting. But it is incredibly small, the camera comes with a caribiner clip instead of a belt loop which is great, and the remote lens is just way cool.</p>

<p>Oh the other problem is the video format – the doc all says “MPEG video” but it is using some Samsung-tweaked codec that nothing in the world understands. So you have to install the Samsung app, force it to convert the video to DVIX or DVI, and then you can use another app to play with – I used Windows Movie Maker as I had it lying around.</p>

Too bad, this would be fascinating to watch. I’m embarrassed to admit that I haven’t contributed anything to Wikipedia yet.</p>

				<p><p>Ok I watch way too much video – broadcast tv, sports, dvds, tivo, bittorrent downloads. I like to think that a lot of it is inspiring, thought-provoking, inspirational, or at least well-produced.</p>

<p>But I do have some guilty pleasures. <a href="http://www.thewb.com/Shows/GenericShow/0,11116,228773,00.html">Beauty and the geek</a> is great fun. Shallow babes and socially inept geeks, forced to help each other.</p>

<p>Even further in the gutter, <a href="http://www.cheaters.com/">cheaters</a>. Nothing like a surprise public confrontation of an adulterer for fun. And the smarmiest host on TV. Not to be missed.</p>

				<p><p>I’ve been pretty skeptical of tagging. There is a lot of evidence that most people don’t bother to associate keywords with content, no matter how easy the software makes it. And tags drift over time, and people disagree on the meanings of individual tags. And search engines make it easy to search the raw text of sites, so why bother with adding keywords? If I want to annotate a site with keywords, well I can just create a blog entry that uses those keywords, and I will be able to find it later on my own blog, or on Google.</p>

<p>But I am intrigued by <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/06/tagcloud-beta-create-keyword-clouds.html">Tagcloud, thanks Phil</a>. And by the <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/06/09/MovableTypeTaggingPlugin.html">Tags Power Tool</a> for movable type. These both make it way easier to automatically create a category hierarchy for my own site. I try to use categories today but they have all the problems of tags; these tools would perhaps help me to automatically create tags and categories.</p>

<p>I guess I am still skeptical about tagging schemes that require people to explicitly tag content, but tools which smartly autogenerate tags seem interesting and possibly useful.</p>

				<p><p>I’ve done a good job since rededicating myself to exercise – getting out on the trails 2 or 3 times a week. And I am still having fun.</p>

<p>On the downside, I fell and broke a rib Sunday. Ouch. Doesn’t prevent me from hiking but quite painful. Basically a rookie mistake – climbed onto a moss-covered fallen log and my feet flew out from under me. I have crappy instincts yet when it comes to the woodlands. As a kid I spent all my summers on the <a href="http://www.pointeaubarilchamber.com/">rocky shores of georgian bay</a>, and to this day I am pretty good at scrambling along rocky, slippery shorelines – I have great instincts when it comes to mossy, slippery, unstable rocks. I have none of those instincts for woodlands terrain.</p>

<p>I haven’t done a podcast yet, and well, it just needs to get way easier and simpler than this if I am ever going to. I can’t see podcast creation ever becoming mainstream, certainly not at this level of complexity. Maybe if I could just talk to my cell to record a high quality podcast, i’d do it.</p>

				<p><p>OK we had intended to hit <a href="http://www.washingtonhikes.com/1999/rattlesnake/index2.html">Rattlesnake Ledge</a> this morning but life got in the way. Perhaps next weekend. Instead I got back out to <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/gis/vmc/Recreation.htm#CM">Cougar Mountain</a> for the second time this week. Starting from the RedTown trailhead, i went out on the Wildside trail and then did a counterclockwise loop on the Marshall’s Hill/De Leo Wall circuit. A nice circuit, I strongly recommend the counterclockwise direction, or you face a killer trail up the De Leo Wall.</p>
