	<meta name="description" content="I read a lot of books this year.  There were some really good ones, and I couldn’t get down to a list of just 5 ala Bill Gates.  I have 10 I would recommend.  I was mostly drawn to nonfiction about macroeconomics this year, trying to get smarter about what is really happening in the world as we seem to enter a new era of money management.   I was also drawn to some great escapist adventure stories, because well the real world has been challenging.

		<p>I read a lot of books this year.  There were some really good ones, and I couldn’t get down to a list of just 5 ala <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Holiday-Books-2021">Bill Gates</a>.  I have 10 I would recommend.  I was mostly drawn to nonfiction about macroeconomics this year, trying to get smarter about what is really happening in the world as we seem to enter a new era of money management.   I was also drawn to some great escapist adventure stories, because well the real world has been challenging.</p>

<h3 id="economics-and-society">Economics and Society</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49644992-the-price-of-peace">The Price of Peace: Money, Democracy, and the Life of John Maynard Keynes</a> was excellent, a great telling of the factors that influenced Keynes.  I was ignorant about him and never realized how committed he was to social reform and delivering economic benefits to everyone.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44525996-escape-from-rome">Escape from Rome: The Failure of Empire and the Road to Prosperity</a> argues that the collapse of Rome gave rise to the diverse competitive structure of the West that made it so successful, and seems relevant today. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/408549.Savage_Peace">Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919</a> is an interesting look at a time period when American democracy was under great stress from pandemics and factionalism, certainly lessons for today.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385639.Secrecy">Secrecy: The American Experience</a> is something I should have read long ago, the rise of government secrecy over the last century is not good for us.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358538-a-libertarian-walks-into-a-bear">A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear: The Utopian Plot to Liberate an American Town (And Some Bears)</a> is a hilarious tale illustrating the failures of extreme libertarianism.</p>

<h3 id="adventure-and-mystery">Adventure and Mystery</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175828.Iron_Lake">Iron Lake</a> is a great mystery set in Northern Minnesota.  It was easy to imagine being there and the characters were excellent, I am very late to this book and author.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55077697-the-blacktongue-thief">The Blacktongue Thief</a> is the start of a great new series, reminded me of Fritz Leiber’s “Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser” books that I read as a kid.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360562.Sharpe_s_Rifles">Sharpe’s Rifles</a> is a book from the midpoint of this character’s series, a fun romp in the Napoleonic era.  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</a> is a great space exploration and first contact tale.</p>

<h3 id="and-then-one-more">And then one more</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25584210-everything">Everything: A Book of Aphorisms</a> is a very nice compendium of wisdom.</p>
