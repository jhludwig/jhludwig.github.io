  <h1><a href="/2005/06/18/cougar-mountain-617.html">Cougar Mountain 6/17</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK I can’t leave well enough alone. I have to take every opportunity to turn everyday human experiences into geekfests.</p>

<p>So I got <a href="http://product.samsung.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&amp;prod_id=SC-X105L%2fXAA">a Samsung SC-X105 Sports Camcorder</a>, attached the remote lens with the provided straps to my head, and went out yesterday morning. You can see and hear what I saw – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/video/outdoors/Waterfall.CougarMountain.061705.wmv">a little waterfall</a> (1 Meg), <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/video/outdoors/TreeCover.CougarMountain.061705.wmv">a nice tree covered trail</a> (2 Meg), <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/video/outdoors/Ribs.CougarMountain.061705.wmv">griping about my ribs</a> (2 Meg), and <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/video/outdoors/BagleySeam.CougarMountain.061705.wmv">the Bagley Seam trail</a> (6 Meg).</p>

<p>These videos are “sports videos” – you see it as I did it, handsfree video shooting, so very jerky and hopping all over the place. The camera is a great fun toy tho some serious aggravations as noted by other reviewers – you have to keep telling it to use the external remote lens every time you turn it on, it doesn’t remember this setting. But it is incredibly small, the camera comes with a caribiner clip instead of a belt loop which is great, and the remote lens is just way cool.</p>

<p>Oh the other problem is the video format – the doc all says “MPEG video” but it is using some Samsung-tweaked codec that nothing in the world understands. So you have to install the Samsung app, force it to convert the video to DVIX or DVI, and then you can use another app to play with – I used Windows Movie Maker as I had it lying around.</p>

  <h1><a href="/blog/2005/06/09/tagging-evolution.html">Tagging evolution</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve been pretty skeptical of tagging. There is a lot of evidence that most people don’t bother to associate keywords with content, no matter how easy the software makes it. And tags drift over time, and people disagree on the meanings of individual tags. And search engines make it easy to search the raw text of sites, so why bother with adding keywords? If I want to annotate a site with keywords, well I can just create a blog entry that uses those keywords, and I will be able to find it later on my own blog, or on Google.</p>

<p>But I am intrigued by <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/06/tagcloud-beta-create-keyword-clouds.html">Tagcloud, thanks Phil</a>. And by the <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/06/09/MovableTypeTaggingPlugin.html">Tags Power Tool</a> for movable type. These both make it way easier to automatically create a category hierarchy for my own site. I try to use categories today but they have all the problems of tags; these tools would perhaps help me to automatically create tags and categories.</p>

<p>I guess I am still skeptical about tagging schemes that require people to explicitly tag content, but tools which smartly autogenerate tags seem interesting and possibly useful.</p>

    <p>I’ve done a good job since rededicating myself to exercise – getting out on the trails 2 or 3 times a week. And I am still having fun.</p>

<p>On the downside, I fell and broke a rib Sunday. Ouch. Doesn’t prevent me from hiking but quite painful. Basically a rookie mistake – climbed onto a moss-covered fallen log and my feet flew out from under me. I have crappy instincts yet when it comes to the woodlands. As a kid I spent all my summers on the <a href="http://www.pointeaubarilchamber.com/">rocky shores of georgian bay</a>, and to this day I am pretty good at scrambling along rocky, slippery shorelines – I have great instincts when it comes to mossy, slippery, unstable rocks. I have none of those instincts for woodlands terrain.</p>

    <p>* Geez I am now like two generations behind on cooling technology – <a href="http://www.nanocoolers.com/products_cooling.php">liquid metal coolers for pcs</a>, <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/22/194250&amp;from=rss">liquid metal cooling for video cards</a>. My cooling problem though is a little different – with 6 computers in 2 small rooms, plus printers, monitors, scanners, speakers, etc etc etc – my problem is room temperature, not pc temperature. No amount of liquid metal cooling is going to make my room cooler. I have installed a small Carrier single-room air conditioner to deal with the issue – so I guess that puts me at the bleeding edge of homes, not many have dedicated AC for computer rooms. So I salvage a little geek pride. * I’d love to explore <a href="http://www.cubix.com/ls/LSD_Links.html">using these bifurcated computers</a> as a heat solution. Put all the electronics in one room, and just run fiber to the I/O devices in another room. * An interesting <a href="http://weblog.garyturner.net/archives/001740.html">observation on home storage</a> – gary asserts that home storage needs are surpassing busines storage needs. I guess this is not surprising, the video subsystem in PC is driven by consumer apps, not business apps, so why not storage? But gosh we need a consumer-friendly reliability and backup solution – RAID and tapes aren’t it. * <a href="http://wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,66498,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2">Gigapixel cameras</a> are coming. OK it sounds like you need a small team of scientists, a truckload of equipment, and some incredibly expensive optics, so I guess we won’t see a Nikon Coolpix version soon. But hey that sounds like what it took initially to make a mainframe computer run and look where we are. Actually I don’t care that much about gigapixel cameras – but boy would I give an arm and a leg for gigapixel eyeglasses – realtime zooming in on images miles away would be handy. * Have to get a <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/News/Story/0,1585,a4-c407-n350,00.html">Babble</a> when they are available – <em>“In essence, Babble turns you into a small crowd–and changes how other people hear your voice,” he added. “The result is that those outside your workspace cannot understand your actual spoken words.”</em> . I can’t claim to need one but how cool. * And this has nothing to do with PCs – but I need this <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000735.php">weedburner</a>. Why trim weeds when a flaming torch will do just as well? Actually this seems like a disaster in the making.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/06/02/great-dinner-at-bis-on-main.html">Great Dinner at Bis on Main</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>We hadn’t been to <a href="http://www.bisonmain.com/">Bis on Main</a> in years, I am not sure why. We had an outstanding dinner there last night – the best salmon we’ve had in a restaurant in a while. The place was packed as well, clearly the busiest place in Bellevue. I’m not sure how this place fell of our list, but it is back on. (<a href="http://members.judysbook.com/posts/content/review.aspx?ci=3954">Crossposted to Judy’s Book</a>)</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/05/31/tv-and-media-center-happenings-of-interest.html">TV and Media Center happenings of interest</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Lots of posts recently as people realize that we aren’t going to see cable/satellite HD feeds into MCE machines for a long time – <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000620044935/">No CableCARD for Windows Media Center until Longhorn (probably)</a>, Say It Ain’t So Joe… <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=1531">Why HDTV Support in MCE Won’t Change Until Longhorn Arrives</a>. Not at all shocking, the PC is DRM swiss cheese. Certainly suggests that the closed boxes – TIVO, captive settop boxes – have a long life yet in the home. I bet that you don’t see HDTV support on the PC until you can run a separate OS in a separate VM with hardware-enforced DRM – ie, until you can run a closed hardware/software box inside a PC.</p>

<p>Meanwhile tho, the MCE developer economy continues to grow – <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=320">here’s a list of plugins you can install</a>. Regardless of HD capability, these boxes make way cool DVD players. As does the <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2005_05_15_archive.htm#111625442821583132">XBOX 360</a>. Sure seems to me that the DVD player market will break into two – cheap low-end fixed function players, and then at the high end, people will put in an XBOX, Mac Mini, MCE, or PS3 box.</p>

<p>Another interesting idea is the <a href="http://www.tvharmony.com/blog/archives/2005/05/echostar_to_rol.html">PocketDish</a>. This seems compelling to me, if I could take all my Tivo or Dish content on the road, without futzing around with a full laptop pc, I’d be interested.</p>

<p>Some interesting <a href="http://www.mindjack.com/feature/piracy051305.html">thoughts by Mark Pesce</a> on the future of TV – <em>“The idea of an advertising payload attached unobtrusively to the television program has a certain appeal; it can be ignored, but it’s always present. The audience can’t edit it out of the program without destroying the content of the program. Audiences will learn accept them — so long as the advertisements aren’t too busy, distracting, or otherwise obnoxious.”</em> We’ve watched this whole season of Alias via torrent downloads and I would have been happy to get an HD download direct from ABC or my affiliate which had modest advertising content in it.</p>

    <p>Our extended family of bloggers are becoming overactive, it is hard for me to keep up. Highlights:</p>

<p>* Rich is digging into MT - <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/blogs/2005/05/20/mt_categories.html">nice tip on category tags</a>, and he <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/blogs/2005/05/20/tongfamily_templates.html">graciously posts his templates</a> – nice idea, I will do this when I am finished hacking on mine too. * Rich on computers – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/2005/05/24/computer_ergonomics.html">proper ergonomics</a> (I’ve been getting a stiff neck recently, good tips), <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/05/27/sony_t350.html">and the new evdo-equipped sony laptop</a> – wifi hotspots are becoming a mess, with 4-5 available in a location of uncertain quality and safety, evdo and similar solutions could become a hit with the business crowd. * Phil with some <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/home-networking-resources.html">great thinking on search scoping</a>, <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/announcing-berry-411-version-22.html">releasing the latest version of Berry 411</a> (installed), talking about <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/myvoipweb.html">myvoipweb</a> (don’t trust caller id anymore), showing off <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/recommended-jobs-feed.html">his jobs sidebar</a> (very cool). * Kudos <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net//2005/05/22/melodeo_launches_on_rogers.html">to Melodeo for Rogers launch</a> * Martin is <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/more_meat_for_t.html">bullish on NPUs</a>. * John and Rich’s <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/05/24/taiwanese_edition.html">book out in Taiwan and Korea now</a>!

    <p>This weekend’s best hike was up Squak Mountain. <a href="http://www.ci.issaquah.wa.us/page.asp?navid=526">The City of Issaquah website lists trailheads</a> – we started at Mountainside Drive. Nice steady uphill hike for 2 miles – gets the heart pumping, but not so extreme that it kills you.</p>

<p>It is a state park but for some reason the <a href="http://www.parks.wa.gov/alpha.asp">state park website</a> doesn’t list it, and I found no good maps online. But the trails are well marked and pretty well maintained.</p>
