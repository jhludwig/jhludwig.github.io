  <h1><a href="/2009/03/12/playing-zune-tunes-in-the-car.html">Playing Zune tunes in the car</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I like the all-you-can-eat economics of my Zune player, it has allowed me to try a lot of music that I would not otherwise have heard. A problem for me tho is – I do most my music consumption in the car while driving. I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zune-H9A-00001-Car-Pack-v2/dp/B000VWOKRG/ref=pd_cp_e_0?pf_rd_p=413863501&amp;pf_rd_s=center-41&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B000IXLHM4&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1GPDA9767NNP9PKC0G4G">Zune car pack</a> and it is fine for what it is – an FM transmitter. But I hate the experience – dynamic range compression (and this seems to be a particularly bad unit for that), difficulty in finding an unallocated slot in an urban area, interference, etc.</p>

<p>I wish my car had an AUX in jack but alas that slot is already consumed by an <a href="http://www.audiusa.com/audi/us/en2/experience/technology/ipod_preparation.html">iPod interface</a> which works great but of course is unusable by the Zune. Some guys <a href="http://www.neocaraudio.com/">claim they are building an adapter</a> but nothing exists. And I don’t have the time to hack one up myself.</p>

<p>So the other alternative is to somehow get Zune songs into MP3 format so that they can be on my iPod or burned on data CDs and thence playable in the car. I don’t really care about stripping off DRM, I want to be legal, but I want to listen to the songs easily in the car with greater fidelity than the FM path allows.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying <a href="http://tunebite.com/en/audio_video_drm_copy_protection/index.html">TuneBite</a> which as I understand it, pretends to be a sound card, captures a playback, and encodes into MP3 using LAME. It also grabs all the tags from the source song and whacks them onto the MP3. It works but is funky. Very sensitive to task load on the PC, any other task will interfere with the encoding. And it just misses some songs from my collection for some reason.</p>

<p>I’d prefer a less Rube-Goldbergian software solution, but for now this is kind of working.</p>

    <p>“It did good work on the collapse of Bear Stearns a year ago, but for the most part it has done a mediocre job of explaining all that has gone wrong with our economic system.” – I’d have to agree, the Journal is not getting it done for me increasingly. Instead they are wasting pages on crappy sports coverage, movie/book reviews, etc. I can get all that content elsewhere.</p>

    <p>* “In a Sunburned Country”:amazon by Bill Bryson. Humorous Australian travelogue. Easy breezy read. * “Empires of the Sea”:amazon by Roger Crowley. More than you ever wanted to know about the battles for control of the Mediterranean in the 1500s between the Ottoman empire and the various Christian states. Brutal unforgiving warfare. * “Tycoon’s War”:amazon by Stephen Dando-Collins. The story of Vanderbilt’s machinations in Central America. Some of Vanderbilt sections are interesting, but the details on minor skirmishing in Central America put me to sleep.</p>

<p>And some fiction to cleanse the palate:</p>

<p>* “Suffer the Little Children”:amazon by Donna Leon. Great entry in a detective series set in Venice. No grand action sequences, just human foibles and painful results.</p>

    <p>* “Matter”:amazon by Iain M. Banks. Solid far future science fiction set in the author’s Culture universe. First I’ve read in this setting, interesting characters tho mostly dead by bookend. I admire an author who can kill off their main characters in furtherance of the plot and emotional impact of the book. * “The Creator’s Map”:amazon by Emilio Calderon. At first I feared this was one of the legion of Da Vinci Code clones, but it is really a spy and love story twisted together. And a deep look at 3 characters who experience the same events, but have profoundly different experiences based on their own issues and emotions.</p>

A reasoned discussion of the pros and cons of native clients vs web clients is up here – <a href="http://al3x.net/2009/02/08/the-problem-with-email-clients.html">Alex Payne — The Problem With Email Clients</a>.</p>

<p>For me tho, all these discussions miss the mark. I make regular use of 4 email addresses – two business, two personal – which I have acquired over the years and I want to maintain. And I don’t want to forward them all to some uber address. So my minimum bar is a client that can handle multiple inboxes with multiple addresses. This drives me to: * the browser, where I can use the various web interfaces of the various systems. This is a little unsatisfying as the web interfaces vary so much across the different mail systems. * the default mac mail client which works reasonably well * the iphone which handles multiple accounts reasonably well (tho the limitation of one exchange account sucks)</p>

<p>I use the iphone for about 60-70% of my mail, the mac mail client for about 25-30%, and the web clients for about 5%. The innovation that google is putting into its gmail client is thus largely wasted on me. It all sounds cool but without the ability to handle multiple accounts, I will rarely use it.</p>
