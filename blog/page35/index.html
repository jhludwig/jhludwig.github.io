			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/7048801715_565030b4df_q.jpg"><img src="images/7048801715_565030b4df_q.jpg" alt="" title="7048801715_565030b4df_q" /></a>I’ve decided to move away from the iPhone for a while, I just got the new Nokia Lumia 900 and am filling it up with apps right now.</p>

<p>Why? Well, <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2012/03/yes-the-retina-display-ipad-is-beautiful-but-the-software-is-starting-to-feel-dated/">iOS is starting to feeling stale</a> – I have an unending grid of apps, there have to be other ways to organize tasks and data. iOS has poor integration across apps, very limited integration between apps and the shell, little data sharing between apps, etc.</p>

<p>And only exposing myself to iOS makes my brain stale – I start to let myself be constrained by the iOS grid and app model. I need to experience are other ways to skin the cat, and Windows Phone is trying some different things which are worth understanding – the facebook integration, pinning of content to the shell, etc.</p>

<p>Switching to Windows Phone also appeals to the contrarian in me. How cool can it be to have an iPhone if everybody has one?</p>

<p>So off I go. Hanselman has a “good list of essential apps”:hnsl.mn/wyuZhY. And I’ve installed the WordPress, ESPN, and Starbucks apps. It is interesting that I can bill apps to either ATT or to a credit card on file with my Zune app – I wonder what the rev split is between carrier and MSFT and app developer for these two different models.</p>

<p>One very positive initial reaction – no stupid pair of crappy earbuds in the box. I’ve thrown so many of the useless Apple ones away.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/i-dont-really-get-gamification">I don't really get Gamification</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">06 April 2012</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I love games, online or board. We always have a gamefest at family get-togethers – this year’s mania was “Survive: Escape from Atlantis”:http://theludwigs.com/2011/12/survive-escape-from-atlantis-is-our-board-game-of-the-season/. And if you tracked my minutes of computer use during the week, I’m pretty sure the “game of the moment”:http://masseffect.com/ would be in the top 5-10. Games are what sucked me into software and computers long ago, I still love them.</p>

<p>So I get games and gaming, they are a durable source of entertainment. We’ve played games for all of human history and we will continue to do so. Betting on games seems like a sound investment strategy tho we’ve never found an investment that worked for us (man I wish we’d had money in PopCap).</p>

<p>However, games have their place, and I don’t want to play games all day long. If you look at the rest of the top 10 sites or services that I engage with, none of them have gamification features. No badges, or levels, or reward systems, or points, or whatever. I use sites because they are great tools (Wordpress, Evernote, Twitter, Amazon, etc) or because they have great content (various sports, tech, econ, news sites) or they are in some other way very effective at helping me run my life or get my job done. All these sites invest a lot in user engagement I am sure – tracking my use, trying out alternatives and watching my response, moving UI elements around to encourage engagement, etc etc. But they don’t push explicit game features at me as part of the site (the sports sites obviously offer fantasy game experiences as an optional part of their site).</p>

<p>“Gamification”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/320px-Pog_Collection.jpg"><img src="images/320px-Pog_Collection-300x197.jpg" alt="" title="320px-Pog_Collection" /></a> seems to take engagement management a step too far, where gamification means putting explicit badges/levels/etc on an otherwise non-game site, to encourage engagement. First, real engagement comes from deep utility – great content or a great tool that really saves people time. No amount of gamification window dressing will overcome shortfalls in utility or content over time.</p>

<p>Second, gamification seems to miss the point of what makes games engaging. Great games have great stories, great characters, great head-to-head combat, are beautiful to look at, respond naturally to your input, etc. Level systems and awards are a part of the experience but only a minor part. Yes I get some gratification from leveling up in COD or other games, but if the game sucked, the level rewards wouldn’t keep me there.</p>

<p>Investing in user engagement makes total sense, and there are a ton of techniques to use, and some of them may start to resemble some elements of games – for instance “Keas”:www.keas.com is using team-building and team competition to encourage engagement in health programs, and this seems to work (we have an investment in Keas) – social is an excellent motivator in many arenas. But gamification as it is generally defined doesn’t really make sense to me. Active management of user engagement, sure, that makes sense. Building great games, that makes total sense. Applying minor elements of gaming to non-game properties, ehh, it just feels manipulative.</p>

<p>I do wonder if applying the deeper elements of games – story, characters – to non-game properties would be a smart thing to try. Obviously requires a lot more creativity and skill, but stories are very very powerful.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">02 April 2012</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/iphone-control.jpg"><img src="images/iphone-control-208x300.jpg" alt="" title="iphone-control" /></a>There was a “Sunday NYT article on voice recognition”:http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/technology/nuance-communications-wants-a-world-of-voice-recognition.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=dragon%20tv&amp;st=cse and how we are all going to control our TVs and other devices with voice. Building on the Siri wave, there is a popular belief that voice will become a significant or even dominant way we interact with devices and services.</p>

<p>I’m a big believer in voice. Ignition is an investor in “Spoken”:http://www.spoken.com/ who is doing great with their existing cloud voice processing business, and have some great ideas for the future. We’re an investor in “AVST”:http://www.avst.com/, “Twisted Pair”:http://www.twistpair.com/, “Public Mobile”:http://www.publicmobile.ca/pmconsumer/ – all voice-based businesses, all doing great. People are never going to get tired of talking to one another.</p>

<p>And that is what voice is really all about – people talking to people, not to devices. I will invest all day long in technologies that improve people talking to people – making it easier, more accessible, cheaper, augmenting with additional services, hosting conversations, etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we don’t talk to our tools and instruments. We touch them. A well designed tool or instrument fits the hands naturally, and in the hand of a skilled practitioner allows great creativity and/or great performances. The feedback during its use is important, we are very sensitive to the feedback and can adjust our use in very fine increments. We don’t attempt to use voice which is an imprecise, error-prone method – in fact, trying to talk very precisely can be quite annoying and unnatural.</p>

<p>So are our computational devices more like tools, or more like people? Do we want to interact with them as tools, or as people? My gut says more like tools, and that we will be more effective using touch and gestures than voice.</p>

<p>There are always going to be edge cases in which voice control is preferred – people with disabilities, handsfree situations. But I’m not convinced voice control will become significant.</p>

Building on the Siri wave, there is a popular belief that voice will become a significant or even dominant way we interact with devices and services.</p>

				<p><p>* “Dream Park”:amazon by Larry Niven and Steven Barnes. Not sure how I missed this one 30 years ago, a very nice murder mystery set in a futuristic theme park. Has aged well, the story is solid. * “The Barsoom Project”:amazon by Larry Niven and Steven Barnes. The followon to Dream Park, not nearly as good. I gave up. Too much wandering around in mythology and the psych aspects of Dream Park. * “Avogadro Corp”:amazon by William Hertling. Interesting ideas about the emergence of a worldwide artificial intelligence, but terrible writing, terrible characters, terrible story telling. In the hands of a good writer this would have been quite a tale. * “Backstage Wall Street”:amazon by Joshua M. Brown. The author pulls the curtains back on some of the sell side antics of financial services firms. If you were confused and thought that financial firms were working on your behalf, this is the book for you. * “The Filter Bubble”:amazon by Eli Pariser. Great book on how the major players on the Internet are collaborating to feed us pablum. Reminds me that I need to challenge myself in my reading and force different thinking into my life.</p>

				<p><p>Reasons to hate Kansas. Or at least feel really sorry for them:</p>

<p>* Tornados.

If all you have to celebrate is your dirt, you are one sorry state.</p>

<p>And a joke:</p>

<p>Q. How do you know the toothbrush was invented in Kansas? A. If it was invented anywhere else, it would have been called a teethbrush.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">26 March 2012</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Good “article in PNW mag”:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw/2017740454_pacificpnerds25.html?cmpid=2628 yesterday about maker resources here in the Seattle area. The particular things I noted:</p>

<p>* “Ignite Seattle”:http://www.igniteseattle.com/ – regular talks about projects, tho next event postponed, hope this is still active * “Dorkbot Seattle”:http://dorkbotsea.org/ – also on hiatus this month but seems like my kind of thing (apparently lots of electricity involved) * “Nerdnite”:http://seattle.nerdnite.com/ – more talks and sharing * “Metrix create space”:http://metrixcreatespace.com/ – parts, workshop, courses, community * “ALTSpace”:http://www.airlighttimespace.org/ – another maker space * “Jigsaw Renaissance”:http://www.jigsawrenaissance.org/ – and another * “Seattle Maker Faire”:http://www.makerfaireseattle.com/ – annual event showcasing projects * “make Seattle”:http://www.makeseattle.net/ * “Geekwire”:http://www.geekwire.com/events/ – really more startup focused but leaking into maker space a little</p>

<p>As an aside, it is so odd that in 2012, the Seattle Times would go to the trouble to research, write, and distribute this article, but then in the web-published version, not link to any of the resources mentioned in it, leaving it to people like me to scrounge together all the links. The web version of the article seems like the afterthought, and the Times misses the opportunity to create the web-based page of record for “Seattle Maker”. I would have thought by now the web version of the article would be paramount, and the print version would be a derivative of that page. But obviously I don’t get it.</p>

<p>In general I don’t get the whole Seattle Times web strategy – and in 2012 that means I don’t get their overall business strategy. Why do they continue to hide their brand under the nwsource domain? It clearly seems like they just don’t care about the web. No other media company of substance behaves this way. Strange.</p>

<p>I also note that Xfinity keeps sending me mail about “their home security offering”:http://www.comcast.com/homesecurity/index.htm?SCRedirect=true, they want to come in my house and install a bunch of sensors and extract even a higher monthly fee from me.</p>

<p>So the obvious thought – why do I need a bunch of distributed sensors in the house? If I can put several cameras and mics in the tv (they are basically free), with full directionality and distance sensing, then my tv could sense in-room movement, perimeter movement, glass breakage, basically all the things a security system senses. Heck, throw in heat, smoke, and CO sensing too for fun, and an accelerometer to detect theft.</p>

<p>I’ve got a TV in our family room/kitchen, my office, our bedroom – if each of these provided full room monitoring for security, that would cover the bulk of the issues in the house. There is some great software that needs to be written to process the signals, identify perimeter movement, let me establish baselines to be ignored, set up different watch conditions for times when home versus times when away etc. But I don’t see why I should need to go thru the braindamage of putting sensors everywhere, solving wiring or battery issues for them, etc.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/yes-the-retina-display-ipad-is-beautiful-but-the-software-is-starting-to-feel-dated">Yes the retina display iPad is beautiful, but the software is starting to feel dated</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">22 March 2012</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK I am completely conflating issues in this post but that accurately reflects my state of mind.</p>

<p>Like everyone else has said, the new screen is beautiful, the pad does run a little hot, the extra weight and thickness is a little noticeable, blah blah blah. Nothing new to add here. For me, the greatest impact is on the readability of text in retina-enabled apps, it really is easier n the eye. And kind of bizarrely, the few iPhone apps I use on the iPad now look really nice when blown up to full screen, they no longer look clunky.</p>

<p>To the point, tho, the iPad hardware continues to improve and I find myself using the iPad more and more.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/PROGMAN.jpg"><img src="images/PROGMAN-282x300.jpg" alt="" title="_PROGMAN" /></a>However iOS is starting to feel dated. The iPad is delivering a Windows 3.x shell experience – a big beautiful screen and all it shows is a sea of spaced icons. And when you tap them, you get full screen apps, it is actually like earlier versions of Windows.</p>

<p>This works fine if you are basically just launching full screen games, videos, and books all day, which is admittedly the greatest part of iPad use for most people. But i actually have to do some real work in my life, I need to accomplish things. I need a tablet that is a little more productive. Right now if i want to work on a project, I have to navigate a sea of apps, and all the project details are spread around in a million places – I’ve got notes in Evernote and docs in Dropbox and Keynote/iCloud and relevant emails in Mail and todo lists in several places. It is not a great experience dealing with all this – hop into mail or evernote to see what I should be working on (and navigate the folder/tag hierarchies in those as necessary), then hop over somewhere else to work on a doc, meanwhile fighting off distractions from other incoming mail or whatever. My projects and my tasks take a distinct backseat to the app hierarchy and that seems wrong. I’d like to have a screen per project – slide over to my screen with all the things i am working on with respect to a portfolio company, and i could see the docs i need to work on, my todo list, upcoming meeting dates, and the latest email thread, and i could send notes and work on docs right there. or slide over to my maker project at home and work on that. or to home remodel project screen where i can see the plan docs, the latest email, the upcoming schedule and discussion items, etc.</p>

<p>I also want all my data to sync everywhere. If I have a project I am working on, I should be able to go to a folder on my desktop machine and see all the related files. And these should all be available on my work machine, my home machine, wherever. Right now I have content stored in Evernote and synced across all my machines, in Dropbox and synced across all my machines, in iCloud synced across all my machines. If I want to get all the content and files for a project, well good luck. None of these storage solutions are really working the way I want to work. Evernote does a nice job keeping everything ordered by folder and project, and has a nice UI, but it is work to get content in and out of evernote and into other apps. Dropbox has the very natural folder-on-the-desktop model which makes it super easy to use with a million apps, but my Dropbox folder is now chaos with all kinds of random stuff intermixed, apps creating their own confusing folder hierarchies (Byline I am looking at you), and it is just chaos. iCloud also keeps stuff stored by app, not by project, and is just further fracturing my storage.</p>

<p>So to summarize, I want a very project-centric experience, with transparent and complete syncing of project files and contents across all machines, and I want all my apps to work with the same project contents. I could use a web product like “OneHub”:www.onehub.com (an Ignition investment) and they have a good ipad app, and this may be the way to go, I am seriously considering. Box.net is too expensive, Basecamp doesn’t have an iPad app. All these solutions have a lot of great collaboration support but that is secondary for me – I just want to keep my own life in order and get my own stuff done. The iPad and current cloud storage solutions aren’t really helping me to focus, keep things ordered, and get things done.</p>
