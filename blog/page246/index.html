				<p><p><strong>Expensing Options</strong>. Reading <a href="http://www.tapsns.com">SNS</a> this week, it just struck me that, rather than trying to assign some debateable value number to options and passing them thru the P&amp;L, let’s do a simpler thing. Let’s just have companies publish quarterly a statement of ownership – who owns what shares; how many new options were granted in the quarter; how many grants expired or were cancelled; new stock issuances as a result of financing moves, etc. And then a clear state of EPS impacts of all this – I just want to know, as a stockholder, did I suffer unfair and unwise dilution during the quarter? This is something that companies could do today without solving the problem of how to value options. And it would be valuable.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Christmas Wish List</strong>. Here’s my geek wishlist as of 10-31. The <a href="http://www.xantech.com/mrc88/index.htm">Xantech MRC88</a> multizone audio controller, so i can centralize and control all my Halloween audio. Or maybe the <a href="http://www.anthemav.com/NewSitev2.0/AnthemProduct/AVM20/Specs/AVM20Specs.html">AVM20</a> for the same purpose. The <a href="http://www.videoxb.com/">Video xb</a> – one simple box to add on to my PCs to solve all my video capture, storage, and authoring issues. Something from <a href="http://www.azdencorp.com/home.html">Azden</a> for wireless distribution of all my Halloween audio. The <a href="http://www.hifi.com/store/category.cgi?category=search&amp;item=c188cdxx&amp;type=store">Cambridge SoundWorks Radio CD</a> to replace my noisy cheap Timex alarm/cd player. The <a href="http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&amp;prod_id=240T-Silver">Samsung 24” LCD Monitor</a> for my desk. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000078OMG/qid=1036106026/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-1880996-6886562?v=glance&amp;n=507846">RCA Scenium 35-Hour Digital Media Recorder (DRS7000N)</a> to replace my existing DVD player and add another HD recorder in addition to my Tivo box. Some nifty <a href="http://www.verbatim.com/products/products.cfm?pro_id=393">Verbatim Vinyl CDs</a>. And the <a href="http://www.nike-philips.com/product_details.jsp?product=psa128max&amp;lang=en">Nike psa[play - Portable Sport Audio by Philips</a> for treadmill time. And a late addition, the <a href="http://exilim.casio.com/camera.cfm">Casio exilim</a> camera/mp3 player.</p>

<p>For the garage I need the <a href="http://www.duluthtrading.com/a/shop/dproduct.asp?UID=2002110200105091&amp;GEN0=&amp;GEN1=&amp;T1=WD696&amp;c=&amp;s=3DTC2">Wall-Mount Desk</a> from Duluth Trading.</p>

<p>Finally for the music hour, the <a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/srs7/sid=021101221354206204189011626143/search/g=home?q=slg100n">Yamaha SLG100N</a> would be a nice practice guitar tho it is dorky looking. And the <a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/srs7/sid=021101221354206204189011626143/search/g=home?q=chordmaster">Chordmaster</a> is way cool for finding chords.</p>

				<p><p><strong>BCS Rankings</strong>. I’ve been noodling over <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/2002-2003.html">these</a>. What a strange way to pick the teams to play for the championship. <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2002/1027/1451838.html">Brad Edwards</a> at ESPN does a good job digging into the mechanics of the system. I’ve been looking at Ohio State’s numbers the last two weeks and have seen some interesting things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most of the top 6 teams lost “strength of schedule” points this week. Only OSU and Georgia improved. OSU gets a double win here and for quality wins as WSU keeps winning. This is really going to come down to nonconference wins for both teams, as the rest of the way they are in conference play and their conference opponents are going to beat the lights out of each other. OSU needs WSU to continue to win.</li>
  <li>While scoring margin has been eliminated as a factor in computer polls, it clearly is still a factor for human voters, as OSU lost two positions in the AP Poll while Notre Dame climbed two positions. This cost us at least a point and maybe more with downstream effects</li>
  <li>Throwing out the worst computer ranking, it is the NY Times, Sagarin, and Colley Matrix polls that are hurting OSU the most, as they have us two positions behind Georgia. TheColley Matrix poll is out of Atlanta, so that explains that. I don’t fully understand the other polls yet.</li>

				<p><p><strong>BCS</strong>. First rankings out – <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/2002-2003.html">Bowl Championship Series - Full Rankings Chart</a>.</p>

<p>OK how can Ohio State be considered to have the weakest schedule of the top 6 teams, but have the most points for quality wins? Makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>I guess it doesn’t really matter now…we just need to beat Penn State Saturday and trust that things will work out.</p>

				<p><p><strong>X10 Halloween</strong>. Deep in the throes of getting all my x10 setup debugged for halloween. Man x10 just sucks. The gear is fragile, all kinds of mysterious communication problems, the software sucks. I hate it. But it is cheap and widely available.</p>

<p>I am close to dumping the gui software I use and just write some scripts. I see that there is Perl support available <a href="http://members.aol.com/Bbirthisel/x10.d/">here</a>. And a web interface on top of perl support at <a href="http://www.homeautomationzone.com/x10-web.shtml">X10 Web Control</a>.</p>

<p>Next year tho I may just pick up a few more dmx dimmers and do away with x10 altogether. I don’t see anything on the web abour perl/python interfaces to dmx tho.</p>

<p>Maybe next year I should be an early adopter of uPNP or some such crazy scheme.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Blosxom progress</strong>. OK I have now also fixed the scripts to deal with the differences between Win2k/IIS and Unix/Apache handling of path elements after the blosxom.cgi reference in the URL. I can find no way to make Win2k/IIS treat this as a path_info argument to a perl script, so i have changed the script to make “?topic=foo” work as the argument to get a specific content blog – e.g. <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/halloween?topic=props">www.theludwigs.com/halloween?topic=props</a>. Which meant i had to patch up the links that blosxom creates for permalinks, etc. I am pretty sure archive viewing doesn’t work quite right yet tho i am not sure I care since I don’t have an archive for my halloween blog. Also haven’t looked at the RSS output yet.</p>
