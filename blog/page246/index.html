				<p><p><strong>Good Trial</strong>. I’ve been trialing the <a href="http://www.good.com/">Good</a> software for the Blackberry 957. The RIM software has always been a little crufty – the todo list for instance is much worse than the Palm’s. So very interested in alternatives.</p>

<p>The pros of the Good software: Full over-the-air sync of all Outlook items (mail, contacts, calendar, todo, notes) is great. I love that. I use notes and todo list a lot, this is a huge boon to me. The homepage calendar view is nice, much more useful than calendar popup reminders. In-band mail addressing is nice – much more intuitive than popping out to the address book browser. Attachment viewing is a nice feature tho not as useful as I thought it would be. It still takes a lot of time to download attachments, and tables don’t come across well as they get unwound to fit on the small screen.</p>

<p>Cons: Performance is slower than the RIM software. I have a large address book (~2000 entries) and a fairly large calendar file. Searching the address book is slower than it was with the RIM software, paging thru the calendar is slower. The RIM software could keep up with my typing, the Good software cannot at times.</p>

<p>Battery life is a big concern. I used up 30% in one day running the Good software – I assume because of the increased radio traffic from all the ota syncing. With the RIM software I could go for a week between cradles without even thinking about it, and 2 weeks at least if I engaged in some modest power management (turn off the device at night). With Good I will have to think a lot more about power management.</p>

<p>The Calendar app is clearly not done. No week view. The month view doesn’t indicate if you have appointments on days, and hence is not useful. No creation of recurring appointments on the device. Agenda view is really really slow. The “jump” dialog is busted – the cursor is placed on the “Go” button by default, not on the date fields. And when you scroll the month field past year end, the year is not auto-incremented.</p>

<p>Addressing doesn’t search on first names. It is great that I can directly edit the “to” field and have it autocomplete names, but i am used to typing in first names and this doesn’t work. You have to type in last names – ugh.</p>

<p>Net/net, based on 3 days experience – I am still sticking with the Good software for now. Over the air sync is nice. But I can’t really enthusiastically recommend it yet. They need to improve performance, the calendar app, addressing, and battery life (I hope they can do over-the-air software upgrades!). Maybe the Good device is better on these fronts.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Storm Sewer Sounds</strong>. Brilliant – from the MoM Group –</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I always wanted to put sound coming out of my storm drain, so this year I did! I used a 1X2 piece of wood and duct taped my two self powered speakers on it, then I taped the CD player in between the speakers. I put two eye hooks on the ends of the wood and used wire to hang pictures on each eye hook. then I twisted it in the middle to make a loop so I could hook it to a chain to lower it down the drain. I tested it last night and it was awesome! It freaked people out as they walked by! I was talking to a neighbor who was walking her dog and she said she was wondering were the sound was coming from. she said she heard it from the next street! I took a walk down the block and sure enough the sound was coming from all the gutters! HA I found a way to haunt the whole neighborhood! The sound was traveling thru the pipes! If you have storm drains in your neighborhood this is a must try! oooo also forgot I used the whisper MP3 that was posted on the list! man did it sound cool! Imagine walking by the storm drain and hearing that!</em></p>

				<p><p><strong>Pinewood Derby</strong>. Helping my son build a boat for science class, I started reminiscing about a similar project from my youth. My Pinewood Derby entry – I slaved over it, with only help from my dad on the powertools. My car looked terrible, it was basically a box with lead weights attached, spray-painted gold. Clearly some of the other kids were way more skilled than me, or had had substantial parental help. But despite looks, I came in second that day, which was pretty exciting. I won a pen and pencil set which was way cooler than the first place prize, a canteen.</p>

<p>Gosh knows why I remember this day with such clarity. Clearly it had a big impression on me. In some way I was really proud of the achievement. And there is something primal about working with your dad on a project like this. I hope my son has the same memories. Obviously a lot of people care a lot about the Pinewood Derby – a lot of info up on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pinewood+derby">Google</a> about.</p>

I have a variety of lights that trigger off my thunder soundtrack – a mix of small strobes, big strobes, 120v incandescent floods, and this year i added in some 12V floods as people on the MoM group say they respond more quickly (basically, lower voltage lights have faster response times). All together I have about 20-30 lights that go off with the thunder spread around the yard. All I did tonight was place the lights. This weekend I have to distribute my DMX control cable and actually start triggering them.</p>

There is reference on the site to supporting quad speakers with DirectX8, but I want something that could support an arbitrary number of speakers. Also I think Jambient assumes a single listener at a single location and that is not really what I want. In practice the effect may be the same but my design assumption is multiple listeners in multiple locations, where the dominant sound at that location is the local sound effect (say my graveyard noises) with the occasional mix in of a panning sound (a ghost flying by). I think I need to talk to an audio engineer to really lay out my specs precisely.</p>

<p>Also Jambient is really designed for realtime usage by an operator, I need full scripted/programmatic control based on events.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">06 October 2002</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>Theatrical Sound Control</strong>. As I’ve been putting out my sound systems for Halloween (5 sets of Bose outdoor speakers, 3 run by separate CD players, 2 run off a single amp with a thunder&amp;lightning sound track synced with lighting effects), I’ve started to realize what I really want for my sounds at Halloween.</p>

<p>I want to home-run all my sound systems to a single PC with multiple sound cards. On this PC I want to run software that programmatically delivers the sounds to any combo of the speakers. And I want to be able to gang all the speakers, or any subset of them, into a surround sound array for any of the sounds I choose to deliver. Obviously the sound to any speaker set should be able to be a mix of any number of sounds from the PC. And on the PC i ought to be able to programmatically control the start/stop of sounds, as well as their locale in space.</p>

<p>With this system, I should be able to achieve the following kinds of effects – ambient wind noise playing thru every speaker, with a natural ebbing and flowing that is spatially coherent across all the speakers; thunder and lightning centered near the front door but mixed in at all the other speakers, attenuated by distance; ghost moans floating across the yard (hopping from speaker set to speaker set); graveyard sounds in the one corner. And this should all be programmatically controllable at the PC.</p>

<p>I’ve started to look for software that would let me do this. Some quick web searching turned up theatrical sound control software at <a href="http://www.harmony-central.com/Software/Windows/jambient-free.html">Harmony Central?: Software: Abstracts</a>, <a href="http://www.crescit.com/products/css01.htm">Crescit Software Inc. - SFX</a>, <a href="http://v.webring.com/hub?ring=tsound&amp;list&amp;page=1">WebRing: hub</a>, and <a href="http://www.stageresearch.com/toolbar.asp">Stage Research, Inc.</a>. Many of these seem similar to the <a href="http://www.rosco-ca.com/products/dimming/horizon.html">lighting control software</a> I use – similar paradigms, similar kinds of overlapping cueing. I don’t see much discussion of surround sound effects tho and that is important. I see products like those from <a href="http://www.minnetonkaaudio.com/Products_3.htm">Minnetonka</a> that let you author surround sound, but I want to be able in my sound control program to take any input sound (stereo, mono, or surround) and programmatically move it thru the space of my halloween display, and have the software compute automatically on the fly the correct speaker inputs across all my speakers.</p>

				<!-- <p><p><strong>Theatrical Sound Control</strong>. As I’ve been putting out my sound systems for Halloween (5 sets of Bose outdoor speakers, 3 run by separate CD players, 2 run off a single amp with a thunder&amp;lightning sound track synced with lighting effects), I’ve started to realize what I really want for my sounds at Halloween.</p>
