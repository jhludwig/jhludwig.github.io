<p>One big problem area tho is that I get a really poor experience with Exchange2k Outlook Web Access pages; it could be the server deciding that I am an unsupported client and sending me highly defeatured pages. OWA pages with IE make heavy use of DHTML and so I suspect the exchange server is picky about what clients it supports fully.</p>

				<p><p>From my Dad – a great one!</p>

<p>In Tennessee, a guy sees a sign in front of a house: “Talking Dog for Sale.”</p>

<p>He rings the bell and the owner tells him the dog is in the backyard. The guy goes into the backyard and sees a black mutt just sitting there. “You talk?” he asks.</p>

<p>“Yep,” the mutt replies.</p>

<p>“So, what’s your story?”</p>

<p>The mutt looks up and says, “Well, I discovered this gift pretty young and I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA about my gift, and in no time they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping. I was one of their most valuable spies eight years running.”</p>

<p>“The jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn’t getting any younger and I wanted to settle down. So I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals. Had a wife, a mess of puppies, and now I’m just retired.”</p>

<p>The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.</p>

<p>The owner says, “Ten dollars.”</p>

<p>The guy says, “This dog is amazing. Why on earth are you selling him so cheap?”</p>

<p>The owner replies, “He’s such a liar. He didn’t do any of that shit.”</p>

<p>Now I agree that we can do so much better…all my devices should broadcast their ids using some RF scheme, so that my remote can learn about them dynamically and reconfigure itself on the fly.

<p>To wit: Last year at Halloween, I was at Home Depot picking up some 10’ lengths of PVC pipe, for my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000703.html">floating lantern</a> project. So there I am in the parking lot, running 10’ lengths of PVC pipe from the front passenger foot well out the left rear window. This made the Jag look really classy.</p>

<p>A guy walks by with his wife, observes my loading, notes the <a href="http://www.ohio-state.edu/index.php">Ohio State</a> alum sticker in my window, and says sotto voce to his wife: “<em>Isn’t that just like a guy from Ohio. He buys the nicest car he can buy, and then he loads it up with lumber.”</em></p>

<p>Made my day!</p>

<p>If you are still playing at being a VC in 2003, you have nothing but patience about liquidity. There is no IPO market, the M&amp;A market is moribund, there is hardly a B and C round market. Patience is all there is left! Which means that all you can do is encourage companies to get to break even, and help them to do so. I am not , on the other hand, very patient about getting a revenue stream going and getting to break even, that is the only path to survival now.</p>

<p>Seems to me our government set too tight a definition for WMDs. Didn’t September 11 demonstrate that the worst WMDs by far are people and organizations of people? With trivial technology, just people can cause all kinds of harm.</p>

<p>If I was in charge of the case for the war, I would have included people and organizations within the definitions of WMDs; particularly people and organizations that foment and export hatred of our culture/society (or really any culture/society, as it is the hatred and the actions that hatred bring on that we want to target).</p>

<p>But then, no one asked me.</p>

<p>Seriously it is a good thoughtful piece from an entrepreneur. If Joel was in Seattle I’d take him to lunch and learn more. I don’t think we’ve done any of the things that he considers most heinous (like a no-shop) but he may have a point about the fundamental misalignment on risk. Tho I am not sure it plays out today like he suggests – I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone at our firm telling a startup to spend more, faster.</p>
