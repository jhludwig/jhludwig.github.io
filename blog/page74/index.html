				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">27 August 2008</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK I don’t know that I am going to pull off our regular Halloween setup this year. But if you want to set up a haunt in the neighborhood, well here is how I’d start. You can get crazy creative about the kind of scene you want to create – but nothing beats a graveyard. And to have a great graveyard you need to have tombstones.</p>

<p>You can buy tombstones from all kinds of retailers – Halloween specialty stores, Home Depot, garden stores, your drugstore will all carry some, mostly all with the message RIP. Some of these look good and there is nothing wrong with picking some up. The more elaborate ones can get spendy but they may be worth it.</p>

<p>But you can also make your own. Start with sheets of <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;productId=100320308&amp;N=10000003+90044+527397">foamboard</a> – use foamboard, not a styrofoam board which is crumbly and hard to glue together. This stuff is very carveable, you can cut out as simple or elaborate a form as you want. And you can carve designs in the face, you can bond pieces together to make pedestals (with the right glue), etc – here are <a href="http://wolfstone.halloweenhost.com/HalloweenTech/grsmak_GraveStones.html">some ideas</a>, and <a href="http://mov.dx.cx/halloween/carving/">some more</a>. Personally I like to rough up the edges of mine a lot, and i even break some and reglue them for added ruggedness. BTW, wear a good mask when you do all this, fumes and particles come off the foamboard and it is probably a nasty biohazard.</p>

<p>For epitaphs, you can carve them in now prior to painting, or paint them on later, or mix the techniques. I do some of all. If you need ideas for epitaphs, well the web is full of them, just search for “epitaphs” or “funnny epitaphs”.</p>

<p>After you have shapes, you will need to paint. I use the cheapest paint I can find in the “Oops” bin at Home Depot as a base, and then finish with one of the various stone effect spray paints. Now, some of the stone effects don’t survive rain well, so experiment. And again, wear a mask, spray paint is nasty.</p>

<p>At this point you now have tombstones! Lean against walls, mount with stakes into the ground, whatever your surface allows. Note that they don’t weigh much, and if you are at a windy site, well, you are going to have a lot of movement.</p>

<p>In future posts I’ll layout simple lighting and sound plans.</p>

Better as a graphic novel than it could have been as a book, the use of text and font and images to intertwine multiple stories works very well.

Another Kovacs novel, this one wasn’t a home run for me. With all the morally ambiguous factions, I could never quite get Kovacs’ motivations. And his drawn out death postponed by one miracle drug after another quit working for me. The whole thing felt a little choppy and unmotivated. * “Biomechanics of the Gastrointestinal Tract”:amazon by Hans Gregersen. Interesting reference on the GI tract, treating it as a mechanical device and analyzing behaviour from that view. Useful to help you build up a complete picture.</p>

I think Michigan will have a lot of emotion and will win this * Syracuse vs. Northwestern. Northwestern. Never take Syracuse * Virginia Tech vs. East Carolina. VT * Michigan State vs. California. Hmm, MSU is the favorite darkhorse in the big10 this year. But hard to win on the west coast. * Hawaii vs. Florida. Florida * Alabama vs. Clemson. Oh damn, Clemson is a trendy pick, but I have never won picking Clemson * Missouri at Illinois. Mizzou. Illinois strugges to repeat last year’s breakthru * Washington vs. Oregon. Hmm, Oregon is confused at QB, UW is not. * August 31 Kentucky vs. Louisville. Ugh, no respect for these teams. Probably take Louisville * Sept 1 Fresno State vs. Rutgers. Take Rutgers at home * Tennessee vs. UCLA. UCLA not ready for primetime yet</p>

				<p><p>Office 2007 for Windows has some really cool features. I love the table formatting in XL, a totally obvious and good feature. And the fact that it is only in the Windows version and not in the Mac version has driven me batty, and has pissed me off so much, that I have finally converted all my XLs into Google Docs spreadsheets and dumped them into the cloud. Yes I lost some cool features. But I never have to install office software again, I don’t need to worry if the latest version is installed on the machine that I happen to be using today, I don’t have to worry about the fact that the last version of that spreadsheet is in my home office machine and not here at work, etc. I am immediately happier. I will miss table formatting, but not that much.</p>
