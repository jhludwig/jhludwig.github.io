				<p><p>So I’m 2 weeks into my first “Udacity”:www.udacity.com and I’m impressed with the quality of the courseware. The instructor is engaging, the videos are good, the pacing of video and interactive content keeps you engaged, the instruction is derived in bite size pieces which really works.</p>

<p>All that said, I am abandoning the course. It is targeted at too junior a level and the pacing is too slow. This is going to be a general problem for online instruction – the students are going to have varied backgrounds, it will be hard to target materials. And grading a course puts a huge constraint on overall course pacing which is what is driving me out. I’d like to fly ahead on the material but that is not the way the course works.</p>

<p>Still a great and valuable first effort.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">03 March 2012</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tier3.png"><img src="images/tier3.png" alt="" title="tier3" /></a>I had the chance to meet “Jared Wray”:http://www.jaredwray.com/ at “Tier3”:http://tier3.com/ (one of our portfolio investments) on Friday and I was incredibly energized by the meeting. Jared is a star and Tier3 has a huge future.</p>

<p>I’m not generally an enterprise IT guy. I’ve worn an IT hat at times, but always for small businesses or small offices. I’ve done some enterprise app development, but eons ago. I’ve worked on software teams that have sold into enterprises and have spent time working on features to support enterprises, so I have some sense of their issues, but I am no expert. So take my views with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>With that caveat – wow have these guys done a terrific job creating a relevant cloud offering for enterprises. It seems super easy to roll apps out to their service because Tier3 supports a huge range of enterprise software with preconfigured orchestration blueprints for setting it all up; they support enterprise security requirements, they understand and provide great monitoring, they provide enterprise SLAs, all while delivering the great cloud attributes like elasticity. And with their new “service provider partners”:http://blog.tier3.com/index.php/2012/02/federated-cloud-release-tier-3-cfn-services, there are going to be a ton of hosting options in locations that work for enterprises, to serve the need to “hug your servers”.</p>

<p>It seems like a no brainer for people to try and adopt Tier3:</p>

<p>* If you are in enterprise IT and want to move some of your apps to the cloud, this seems like the way to go. Or at least consider. And with great “no-cost self service activation”:https://www.tier3.com/Activate/, there is really no reason not to try. * If you are a startup targeting the enterprise, Tier3 provides an environment giving you access to the computing environment of the enterprise. Again free to sign up and a pay as you go model, so why not try? * If you are a service provider and want to provide enterprise grade services for your enterprise customers, a great set of services available for adoption.</p>

<p>We (Ignition) really have to step up and help Tier3 get the word out about what they are doing. They are already growing at a great clip but we can and should help them do more. They need great people in sales, marketing, and product development. And they need trials from customers and feedback.</p>

<p>Very exciting, great to be working with these guys.</p>

				<p><p>Sigh. I’ve downloaded the install 3 times, generated a new license key (I hope they don’t run out), and twice tried to do a clean install off a USB key and once off a burned DVD. Every time install fails partway thru with a error 0x8007025D and some text about being unable to write files. I’m doing an install to a new disk with 1.3TB of free space, and the drive seems to work fine under win7. I don’t want to do an upgrade install. Searching around the Internet doesn’t seem to bring any relief, some people have encountered similar issues when installing in a VM but I am not doing that.</p>

<p>On the plus side my Lytro arrived so I will go play with that.</p>

<p>UPDATE: some nice MSFT folks have been helping me thru the problems and I have a working win8 install now. Will do a separate post on that, but just want to thank the MSFT folks for working with me.</p>

				<p><p>Twitter streams, RSS feeds, inbound email, facebook updates, linkedin, man it is easy to lose yourself in the constant chatter of the current age. I fight every day to rise above the wash of minutiae and think about the things that really matter in the longterm.</p>

<p>So I’m being way more thoughtful about what I read. It is easy to get drowned by all the tech industry blog/press content, but there is a lot of echo in this content, and given the huge drives to publish publish publish, a lot of less thoughtful content. And has been well noted by others, <a href="http://brianshall.com/content/mg-siegler-vows-steal-arringtons-transparency-crown">not a lot of transparency</a>. So less daily tech coverage, more thoughtful analysis on long wave trends.</p>

<p>Also, some great inspirational thoughts that arrived on my screens yesterday to help me:</p>

<p>* “Starting at the beginning of February, I made a change. Each day I blocked off a precious hour to build something.”:http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/02/29/a_precious_hour.html. Hear hear. Creating is hard hard work but is infinitely more rewarding than consumption. * “So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.”:http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes. It is super important to keep my brain open to new ideas and not just wallow in the stuff I already know, so I do need to keep a little brainspace open for other’s ideas. * “…so I’ve started forcing myself to ask the other person at least three questions about their opinion. Forming those questions helps me think. Often, my gut negative opinion changes. Sometimes, the questions change the other person’s opinion. There is no downside.”:http://dcurt.is/three-questions. Another way to keep the brain open.</p>

				<p><p>“The Future of Software Development Will Be Online”:http://blog.calbucci.com/2012/02/future-of-software-development-will-be.html – very nice articulation from Marcelo on the need for a browser-based IDE.</p>

<p>Tho I think calling it “browser-based” kind of confuses the issue. Do I really want my IDE to be in a browser, or my spreadsheet or presentation package to be in a browser? I’m not really in love with my browser UI, but that is not the point. For me, the #1 feature I need for productivity apps these days is ubiquitous availability. I need to use them at work, at home, on the road, from my iPad, my phone, my Mac, my PC, wherever. I will give up a lot of features to get ubiquitous availability. And I get to move the backup burden to someone else – my machines all become stateless, I can replace them tomorrow and become instantly productive. This is all super goodness.</p>

<p>And from the comments, “cloud9”:http://c9.io/ looks like the cloud IDE to try – looks awesome.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">29 February 2012</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>So, a “41 megapixel camera phone from Nokia”:http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Nokia-808-PureView-41-megapixel-Camera-Phone,news-14288.html, pretty amazing. The improvement in camera phones over the last 5 years has been amazing. Moore’s law has driven the cost of camera chipsets into the ground, and their performance has continued to increase. Just like the earlier digital camera wave destroyed the film/processing/prints business, now the smartphone+software combo is destroying the digital point-and-shoot camera market. Moore’s law is a powerful force.</p>

<p>Higher-end cameras are being transformed as well. DSLRs are under assault by the new breed of mirrorless camera bodies. Sensors are getting good enough as are the LED/LCD viewfinders, permitting a shift to these new smaller platforms. This shift will take a little longer because of people’s investments in lenses, but it is underway.</p>

<p>Both of these shifts are about software and silicon, driven by Moore’s Law, eating away the mechanics of the camera. I suspect that we are in for even more dramatic changes, Moore’s Law is still hard at work. There are still a lot of mechanical parts in these cameras, and a lot of error-prone human involvement in composing, aiming, and timing image capture. As the cost of processing and memory continue to drop, how else might be picture-taking be transformed?</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://www.lytro.com/">Lytro</a> (supposed to arrive this month) is attacking some of the lens mechanism via silicon. Rather than having a complex mechanism to direct just the photons you want to the capture surface, the Lytro captures a broader set of photons and does all the focusing post-capture. It is early days but we seem to be heading for cameras that capture all the incident photons (frequency, phase, angle of incidence) and let you assemble the photo you want later. * Photo timing still requires a lot of human involvement, and is a source of many lost photos for exposure reasons and mistiming of the photo. This seems to be great opportunity area – the camera could use the shutter button as a hint, continually grab an image stream, save the couple seconds around the hint, and use software to find the best one. The realities of battery life may be the limiting factor here. * Cameras can also take a hint from computers. Rather than making bigger and faster processors, we’ve moved to 4-core and 8-core and beyond. At the whole system level, we get better graphics performance by using SLI or other techniques to do use multiple GPUs. Rather than having bigger and bigger sensors, it seems likely that cameras will move to multiple sensors. Bonded together to create one image, or spread around the camera body. Why? Well this could be used for 3d cameras – Fuji has some commercial 3D cameras, and there are a lot of “research efforts”:http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ITEIS.130.1561N. Or to create HDR cameras – cameras that capture multiple exposure images at once. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_spider"><img src="images/320px-Mystaceus-300x195.jpg" alt="" title="320px-Mystaceus" /></a>Or crazy “spider eye-inspired 3d and focus”:http://www.petapixel.com/2012/01/27/jumping-spiders-eyes-may-inspire-new-camera-technologies/. * Maybe cameras can eliminate the whole sighting and composition step, you could just kind of point your camera in the broad direction you want and snap. Maybe the camera can have sensors on all sides, you could just kind of wave your camera cube around. We are headed for a point where sensors are basically free, so I’d expect a lot of innovation in placement and number of them.</p>

<p>So if a future camera is taking kaboodles of images in all directions all the time because sensors and local memory and processing power is free, what will be the constraining factors in taking and using pictures? Well battery life and bandwidth will still be realities. And software. We will need software that can deal with an explosion of photo and video content. I have a lot of photos today, 50K or so, it is a management struggle. What if I have 500K? 5M? What if a business has billions of photos, billions of minutes of video? How do people find their way thru the flood to find the best pictures, to stitch together pictures and videos from different sources into a coherent whole? What post-processing takes place to clean up the pictures, fix up composition, correct errors, etc? And how do you search across everyone’s gigantic photo streams to find the photos you really want to see? Investing in “big data for pictures/video” should be a durable investment thesis.</p>

<p>I’m not clear how it all plays out, but I feel pretty certain that Moore’s law will insure that the way we take and use pictures will be dramatically different in 20 years. A gigapixel camera might be nice but I suspect the silicon and software will be used not to just crank up resolution, but to address the other steps in taking pictures – composition, timing, exposure, aiming, post-processing, finding, sharing, etc.</p>

Don’t really love the topic, but good material to practice some Python and some statistical inference. So far, the course website seems to work very well, nice intermixing of video with interaction, nice breaking of instruction into short easily consumable pieces. And seems to scale well – in the forum, the most popular posts are approaching 4K views, so a pretty large class size, but pretty effective so far.</p>

<p>The material is early/middle undergraduate level at this point, but purportedly will ramp up.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://www.barnesandnobleinc.com/index.html"><img src="images/nook.jpeg" alt="" title="nook" /></a>Scene yesterday afternoon at the Local Barnes &amp; Noble – 5 of us in line waiting to pay for books; 1 sales clerk working hard (and telephoning back for help that never came), and the Nook salesperson at the Nook counter waiting sadly for someone to ask him about Nooks, straightening and dusting all his Nook accessories. The line moved so slowly that I called the store – someone picked up – I said “hey you need help up front checking people out” – the person on the other end said everyone was busy helping customers.</p>

<p>A simple proposal – get a payment app working on a Nook with a card reader. If the Nook salesperson isn’t helping anyone, have him wave over a retail customer and check him out on a Nook. For the customers, a win – they get thru the line faster and aren’t annoyed by seeing the Nook guy just stand there doing nothing. For the Nook sales effort, a win – you get a customer over at the Nook counter and you can softly sell him on the attributes of the Nook while checking out.</p>

<p>Last month I whined about <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2012/01/bn-i-expect-more-than-this/">in-store presentation</a>. This month checkout. I’d really love to see B&amp;N thrive, I love books and I like bookstores. So I will keep tilting at the windmill.</p>

				<p><p>We now have 3 cupcake stores in downtown Bellevue – stores that feature cupcake in their name, and sell primarily cupcakes. In addition to all the bakeries and other establishments that offer cupcakes, and the giant cupcake display counter now at QFC.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.howsweeteats.com/2012/02/chocolate-lovers-cupcakes/comment-page-2/"><img src="images/cupcakes-223x300.jpg" alt="" title="cupcakes" /></a>I like baked goods as well as anyone, and I estimate that, prior to the flood of cupcake stores, I ate cupcakes about once every 5 years. This does not bode well for the cupcake retailers. I feel badly for the store owners who have sunk a lot of money into their efforts, but my gosh, with a little forethought you might have anticipated that a cupcake store was not a great idea. When I walk thru the grocery store, before the current cupcake craze, I saw darn little in the way of cupcakes, which is a hint that people just don’t eat that many cupcakes. Contrast with the amount of space in the grocery dedicated to ice cream or to sandwich makings, and you can see why sandwich shops and ice cream shops might endure (though we are awash in frozen yogurt places at the moment as well).</p>

<p>Maybe the theory was that the cupcake’s time had arrived, that we were going to see a massive increase in the consumption rate of cupcakes. You would have to assume that something fundamental had changed about cupcakes or about human nature to believe this. As near as I can tell there has been no breakthrough in cupcake science or cupcake production costs.</p>

<p>I will try to do my part, I might even double my cupcake consumption rate and buy one every couple of years. But the first rule for a business should be – try to target a frequent and durable need of your customers.</p>

After 15 years of people demanding more and more free content and service on the Internet, any shift back towards sustainable business models seems good.

<p>Reminds me of the classic 4 quadrant chart of ambition vs competence. Being competent is good, but you need to have a dollop of ambition. And you have to get the ambitious and incompetent people out of your org as quickly as possible.</p>

				<p><p>In my first job after grad school, I was giving a client presentation when a junior staffer at the client asked me a question that I felt was dumb. And so during the presentation, in front of his boss and his boss’s boss, I ripped his question apart.</p>

<p>After the meeting, my <a href="http://www.booz.com/na/home/39967795/39968305/39969079/39903939">mentor</a> and manager pulled me aside and said “You know, you might want to develop a weapon besides the bazooka.” And pointed out how I had humiliated the client staffer, and that I was unlikely to get a lot of cooperation from him in the future. Oops.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/298px-Soldier_with_Bazooka_M1.jpg"><img src="images/298px-Soldier_with_Bazooka_M1-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="298px-Soldier_with_Bazooka_M1" /></a>I’ve gotten better at this over the years, but I was reminded of this recently when <a href="http://www.ignitionpartners.com/jonathan-roberts/">one of my partners</a> and I sat through a pitch. At the end of the pitch, I pointed out a number of flaws in very terse fashion. My partner shared his own experiences, mentioned some challenges, and asked some gently-pointed questions. The team likely left the room thinking that my partner was really wise, and that they’d like to sit down with him. In contrast, they probably thought I was a d*$k.</p>

<p>I have to keep reminding myself – the goal of business communication is to make yourself understood, and to hopefully effect positive change. If you communicate in such a way that people write you off, well, hard to make progress from that point on.</p>
