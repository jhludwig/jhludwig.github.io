<section class="single">

		<p>In my first job after grad school, I was giving a client presentation when a junior staffer at the client asked me a question that I felt was dumb. And so during the presentation, in front of his boss and his boss’s boss, I ripped his question apart.</p>

<p>After the meeting, my <a href="http://www.booz.com/na/home/39967795/39968305/39969079/39903939">mentor</a> and manager pulled me aside and said “You know, you might want to develop a weapon besides the bazooka.” And pointed out how I had humiliated the client staffer, and that I was unlikely to get a lot of cooperation from him in the future. Oops.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/298px-Soldier_with_Bazooka_M1.jpg"><img src="images/298px-Soldier_with_Bazooka_M1-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="298px-Soldier_with_Bazooka_M1" /></a>I’ve gotten better at this over the years, but I was reminded of this recently when <a href="http://www.ignitionpartners.com/jonathan-roberts/">one of my partners</a> and I sat through a pitch. At the end of the pitch, I pointed out a number of flaws in very terse fashion. My partner shared his own experiences, mentioned some challenges, and asked some gently-pointed questions. The team likely left the room thinking that my partner was really wise, and that they’d like to sit down with him. In contrast, they probably thought I was a d*$k.</p>

<p>I have to keep reminding myself – the goal of business communication is to make yourself understood, and to hopefully effect positive change. If you communicate in such a way that people write you off, well, hard to make progress from that point on.</p>
