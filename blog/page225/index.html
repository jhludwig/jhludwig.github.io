  <p><em>His writing is hugely, vastly self-important as well as highly affected. (He claims that’s necessary for clarity! A joke, presumably.)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a wise friend once observed to me, “most nonfiction books should really be pamphlets”, and that seems to be the case here in spades. The first 200 pages have about 5 interesting points – a powerpoint slide or two would have sufficed.</p>

				<p><p><strong>My Picture Hardware</strong>. <a href="http://www.viair.com/management/srhee.htm">Someone</a> reading my blog recently asked me what kind of photo hardware I use.</p>

<p>i am not a photo enthusiast. i am just a dad who wants a modest number of pictures. i don’t want to learn about f-stops, shutter speeds, exposures, etc. my ideal camera has one button. so given that…</p>

<p>i currently use 3 cameras – 2 still, 1 video. (i don’t count the panasonic gd87 phone as one of these). For everyday stills, I use the <a href="http://exilim.casio.com/camera.cfm">casio exilim</a> – 2megapixel. very small, long long battery life. i use it alot because it is easy to slip in a pocket. it has crappy optics, digital zoom – a real photo geek would sneer at it. but it is useful. I also have a <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=9/19/487/103&amp;pq-locale=en_US">kodak dx4900</a>. better optics than the casio, 4 megapixel, really easy download to pc, and easy to recharge. battery life kind of sucky tho. and too big to carry around all the time. But C likes the pictures better.</p>

<p>for printing drafts, i use an hp color laserjet. for final prints i use <a href="http://www.shutterfly.com">shutterfly</a>. i tried all kinds of printers, and a) C was never happy with the prints, b) the printers were very finicky and slow, and c) the consumables were so expensive. once i moved to a service, C was happy, and it was less hassle for me.</p>

<p>For video i use a canon gl1. kind of expensive but takes great movies and corrects for a lot of my flaws. I don’t understand what even 10% of the buttons on this camera do.</p>

Creating a connection between them tho is so hard, regular humans could never do this. I ended up using the remote terminal goo in Windows XP but what a mindblower this is. Opening up a window on the remote pc, seeing your local drives mapped in crazy new places within this window with funny names – i can’t imagine explaining this to a regular human being.

Via <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/03/06#When:8:32:14AM">Scripting News</a>, marca doesn’t have the “time or ego need” for a blog. My paltry traffic level certainly doesn’t result in an ego boost! And I get great payback on time spent. Maybe marc is worried that his postings can’t stand up to the full light of day (obviously that hasn’t stopped me).</p>

				<p><p><strong>My new camera phone.</strong> <img src="images/panasonic.jpg" alt="Phone filming Phone" /> I am using a <a href="http://www.directmobilephones.com/panasonic_gd87voda.htm">panasonic gd87</a> on the <a href="http://www.attws.com">att</a> gprs network now. Very cool, a nice form factor, an integral camera, small size – lots of wows from folks at <a href="http://www.ignitionpartners.com">Ignition</a> today. But it was a herculean buying and provisioning effort requiring the aid of literally world experts.</p>

<p>I wanted a cool small form factor phone with an integral camera, not some clunky addon camera that I would lose or never use or end up breaking the fragile connector. And it had to be gsm for travel. All of which pointed me towards phones available in Europe, not in the US. Besides the panasonic I also looked at the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html">Nokia 3650</a> and a <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2130655,00.html">siemens model</a>. I went with the panasonic because it has the most active ebay presence at the time but the nokia may have passed it now.</p>

<p>Ebay is definitely the place to find these phones – ACS has an <a href="http://www.stores.ebay.com/id=2462807">ebay store</a> with a lot of camera phones as does <a href="http://www.stores.ebay.com/id=1636322">wireless express</a>. I bought from ACS. Wherever you buy, make sure the phone comes in an english language version – some foreign phones don’t, particularly if originally intended for the asian market. And make sure the phone is unlocked and can be used on a US network.</p>

<p>The phone shipped promptly, and on initial receipt I was a little scared. It was originally intended for the Vodaphone network and the box was all in german, the instructions were in german. Taped to the side was a converter for the charger plug (german of course) and a photocopied set of english instructions. Did not inspire confidence!</p>

<p>I bravely moved my ATTWS SIM over and no problem, gsm voice service was available immediately! But no data services worked – I dug into settings and the WAP browser and email service were all pointing to vodaphone private IP addresses, clearly this was never going to work. So I moved the SIM back to the ATTWS phone and dug through all the screens to find the IP, WAP, and MMS settings – a very painful process going thru all the menus. And this is where I needed the world experts – <a href="http://www.smithstuff.net">Adrian</a> and his buddies among the att alums and current employees helped find all the right settings. Once I had all the settings, I moved the SIM back to the panasonic, set all the settings, added the settings for my work SMTP server, and amazingly it mostly worked. MMS doesn’t seem to work but I can do email, browse the web, etc.</p>

<p>Was it worth it? Well the phone looks cool. The UI is very hard to use tho. And the pictures are izone-like in terms of quality. But a great learning experience.</p>
