    <p>I find this article fascinating – <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/14/business/media/14JAM.html?ex=1373515200&amp;en=44a9267d39e70cc4&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND" title="One Music Label or Several?

Pearl Jam has found a way to create a constantly renewable, inexpensive source of content – their nightly recordings. Given the file sharing networks, you have to wonder if more bands don’t move to live recordings as their primary recorded output, instead of studio recordings. Studio recordings are expensive to make, and in a sense they discourage consumption of live music. Pearl Jam seems to making the right steps as artists to respond to file sharing networks, by emphasizing the live experience and unique (and low incremental cost to produce) recordings from these live experiences.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.gonze.com/index.cgi/2003/07/12#7-12-3">Good analsys of public wifi</a>: _Two clues for vendors:</p>

<p>1) It costs nothing to provide WiFi. If that’s not true, you’re doing it wrong. The billing infrastructure is probably 90% of Starbucks’ cost. So loosen up on access, don’t freak out if somebody finds a hole that gives them free access, and focus on keeping costs down.</p>

<p>2) If users can’t log in and get going in a hurry, your WiFi is useless. You can’t charge a premium *and* provide bad service, and since charging a premium means that you have lock down the system so tightly that it takes a while to log in, don’t do either._ Thanks <a href="http://gary.burd.info/">Gary</a> for the pointer.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/07/09/online-bill-payment.html">Online Bill Payment</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve used Money with my local bank for years to pay bills. And before that used Checkfree. I’ve become increasingly unhappy with Money as it seems to have a lot of database corruption problems. And my bank is screwing me on fees. So it is time to look around for alternatives.</p>

<p>I found one review site of online billpay products – <a href="http://www.consumersearch.com/www/personal_finance/online_bill_paying/index.html" title="Online Bill Paying Product Reviews and Reports by Consumer Search - ConsumerSearch.com">Online Bill Paying Product Reviews and Reports by Consumer Search - ConsumerSearch.com</a>. This seems to summarize all the services that include bill presentment in some form. Paymybills has been folded into <a href="http://www.paytrust.com">Paytrust</a> since this review. I kind of like the idea of electronic bill presentment but the costs are nontrivial – basically $1 per bill presented and paid thru the system. That is a steep price to pay for the convenience of all online bill handling. I do 40-50 bills a month easily, it is going to cost me close to $50 a month for the service. Maybe I can get smarter about setting up autopay thru a credit card for some of my bills to get the volume down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.checkfree.com">Checkfree</a> is cheaper – free! – but only handles online bill presentment for a limited number of vendors. But the price is compelling.</p>

<p>Then there are all the bank offerings. For instance <a href="http://www.citibank.com">Citibank</a> or <a href="http://www.bankofamerica.com">BofA</a>. Bill paying is free with an account with either one. Citibank additionally has bill presentment, pricing similar to paytrust. Citibank was rated #1 in some Forbes 2002 Best of Web review.</p>

<p>Finally the portals have offerings. <a href="https://billpay.msn.com/default.asp">MSN Bill Pay</a> is free for their very limited set of participating billers, but costs $.50 a transaction after that. Bill presentment from a very small set of billers. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/bph">Yahoo Bill Pay</a> looks similar, $.40 a transaction tho. Basically they save you the hassle of buying stamps and envelopes for a very small premium.</p>

<p>So I am not sure what to do. Path A: go whack on my current bank and get them to drop all their fees so they are in line with citibank and bofa. Solves my cost problem but still stuck with money. Path B: Use Yahoo Bill Pay – pretty cheap. Path C: Switch to Citibank and get the lowest cost for most bills plus the option of paying for online bill presentment. I need to think about. Switching banks is a PITA.</p>

    <p>We had an offsite yesterday to discuss follow-on financing rounds for our fund I companies. We have 7 active investments in this fund and all will need additional funding over their lifetime. Given the weak state of the b+ round and mezzanine round markets, it is likely we will be a significant participant in the future rounds for all these investments. These are tricky investment decisions – we have large financial and emotional commitments to these firms, some of us have fiduciary responsibilities, it is difficult to make objective decisions. It was a great session – I work with great people, we had some great bonding moments. Lots of different points of view, but a good consensus about the need to examine follow on rounds very carefully, in effect viewing them as new investments. Also a lot of consensus that we are wise to have a plan and budget for each company, so that we have sufficient funds for the companies we are most excited about, and that we don’t just let our funds drain to whoever shows up first.</p>

Computing, connectivity, mobile, convergence, communications, software, etc.">an MSFT dividend is a bearish, bad thing</a>. As a stockholder I think it is a wonderful thing. I don’t want MSFT to buy ATT stock, to buy Nextel stock, to invest in a bunch of hare-brained startups, to try to start a VC fund, or to do any other non-software adventure. I’d even like to see them shut down some of their money-wasting non-PC adventures like their smartphones and xbox efforts. MSFT is really really good at PC software, and they run a really really profitable PC software business. Everything else is just a money-wasting adventure and is not their core competence. So please, give the money back to the shareholders, let us make our own decisions about what other ventures to invest in. This isn’t bearish at all, I will invest the money elsewhere, and I trust the market economy to efficiently direct that investment towards opportunities that are high growth and that may not be MSFT’s core competence.</p>
