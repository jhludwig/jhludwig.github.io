<p>Well we had our Herbfarm dinner last night. Quite an experience, we can see why this place has a national reputation. The owners are passionate about their restaurant and they create a real event, almost a festival atmosphere.</p>

<p>The restaurant is in a beautiful building. A gorgeous dining room, a large open kitchen, an attached wine cellar, all in french country style.</p>

<p>We sat down at 7pm and got up a little after midnight. The food list (none of these huge servings):</p>

<p>- Sauteed Oyster with Sorrel Sauce - Quail Egg Benedict with Cured Salmon and Watercress Sauce - Perigord Black Truffle &amp; Leek Tart - Celery Root &amp; Oregon White Truffle Ravioli - Alaskan Side Stripe Shrimp in Truffled Garlic Sabayon with Fennel Tempura and Apple Slaw - Seared Duck Foie Gras and Perigord Truffles with Yellow Finn Potatoes, Briased Endive &amp; Shallot RIngs - Sorbet of Douglas Fir - Thyme-grilled Squab with Oregon Black Truffles, Lentils, Bloomsdale Spinach and Golden Beets - Juniper Grove Goat Cheese Buche with Charlotte of Spice Bread &amp; Tart Cherry Chutney - Wild Huckleberry Souffle with Rose Geranium Sauce - Armagnac, Thyme &amp; Prune Ice Cream Crepe with Maple-poached Pears - Chocolate Eclair with Lavender Praline Cream - Assorted chocolate Truffles</p>

<p>And we had 6 different wines - 97 Argyle Brut, 2000 Matthews Cellars Semillon, 99 Adelsheim Clone 76 Chardonnay, 98 Beran Vineyards Estate Pinot Noir, 94 Chateau Sainte Michelle Artist’s Series Meritage, and an 1875 Barbieto Malvazia Madeira.</p>

<p>It was quite an adventure. We had more fun than we anticipated, the service was amazing and friendly, and we were seated close enough to other tables to talk with other diners (a couple who had driven 7 hours from Missoula for the dinner).</p>

<p>To our surprise I think we liked the Foie Gras the best of all the dishes. But they were all fascinating.</p>

<p>This coming Friday night C and I are going to dinner at the <a href="http://www.herbfarm.com/">Herbfarm</a>, the most famous restaurant in the Pacific Northwest. We bought the dinner at a school auction. You typically have to reserve a year in advance. Very French with a lot of snooty wine and stinky cheese and strange animals and parts of animals. Wish us luck.</p>

<p>Ooh I see this weekend they are featuring truffles. This is much preferable to sweetbreads or gosh knows what else.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Back to the Grind</strong></p>

<p>Both L and J back to school today. A tough morning, everyone up and moving by 620 am. 6 weeks of grind until mid-winter break in february. That’s not so bad. We’re going to Arizona for a week in February so we have something to look forward to.</p>

<p>Raining raining raining today. As it was yesterday. Why we hate Seattle. But on the good side of the ledger, the daffodil shoots all broke thru in the last 4-5 days, so spring is already on its way!</p>

<p><strong>College Update</strong></p>

<p>Another school L is now considering is <a href="http://www.oxy.edu/">Occidental</a> in LA. She met a student from her high school who now goes there and loves it. And per the website, Oxy is ‘Hot’, according to <a href="http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/611721.asp">Newsweek</a> and the WSJ.</p>

<p>C and I are trying to figure out why “Oxy” is the abbreviation for “Occidental”.</p>

				<p><p><strong>The Outback Bowl</strong></p>

<p>From my Dad, today’s guest blogger:</p>

<p>“Whoa! What a second half and a fantastic fourth quarter! We were glued to our seats for the entire game!(after the first half—there were some who wanted to leave!) We prefer to think that Ohio State lost the first half 14 to zip…but won the second half 28 to 17! The team played well but our offensive coordinator needs a little work. We expected them to go for the bomb on the last few seconds of the ball game…not with so much time left on the clock…..in my opinion the coaches got lost in the excitement of the game amd lost site of their objective. We would of preferred overtime to this ending! Oh well…there are many fans who believe Tressel will really make his presence felt in the oncoming years!”</p>

				<p><p><strong>Fitness</strong></p>

<p>One of the great things about our Outward Bound trip last year is that it forced me into a fitness regimen. I am a goal oriented person and I need some form of clear tangible goal to get me into the gym.</p>

<p>I think I have found my next goal. I want to eventually hike at least a portion of the <a href="http://www.pcta.org/">Pacific Crest Trail</a>. I’d like to do a 5-10 day trip on the trail, in a small group. I have a lot to do to get ready. First of all fitness. Carrying a pack for 5-10 days while hiking some reasonable altitude gains is going to be tough. Then I need to get updated on first aid, on orienteering, on water use, on camping, etc.</p>

<p>Since we also have a lot of family activities, personal activities, and of course my job, it is going to take me a few years to get everything ready for this. But I am excited about the goal. It will be a stretch and I will learn a lot.</p>

<p>The Economist’s <a href="http://www.economist.com/books/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=916756">book picks for the year</a>. A pretty interesting list. I’ve ordered 4 or 5.</p>

<p>As indicated in my book links, I am reading a great book on construction failure right now. Deep in my heart I’ve always wanted to be an architect and I guess I am going to slowly read my way through the field. The best thing I have learned in this book so far – poorly constructed concrete and masonry structures can be deadly out here in earthquake country. Now I understand why Seattle buildings have so little ornamental stonework on them – it falls off in quakes and kills people.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Portland Trip</strong></p>

<p>We had a nice trip down to Portland. What a great city – feels much more old world than Seattle. Narrower streets, older buildings, just a lot more style. A great city for walking around. ANd you have to love no sales tax.</p>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.heathmanhotel.com/home.htm">Heathman Hotel</a>. We recommend it if you ever get Portland way. A beautiful lobby in which they host a holiday tea. It was booked too far in advance for us to partake but we will try to do so in the future.</p>

<p>We visited <a href="http://web.reed.edu/">Reed</a> and <a href="http://www.lclark.edu/">Lewis and Clark</a> Colleges. Both beautiful campuses. Reed felt more like a midwest or east coast campus with older buildings and a lot of deciduous trees in a suburban setting. Reed has about 1400 undergrads, 77% from outside the Northwest. It is a very short drive into downtown Portland.</p>

<p>Lewis and Clark is a bit further out, also in a suburban neighborhood. The campus feels more typically northwest with a lot of douglas firs, etc. A little larger than Reed, about 1800 undergrads.</p>

<p>A great trip and I am sure we will go back to at least Reed when L starts making formal visits this spring.</p>

<p>Hope everyone is having a great day. We are all well and enjoying the day together.</p>

<p>This past weekend we went to see, among other things, a performance by <a href="http://www.bobs.com/">The Bobs</a>. What an amazing group. They did some great a capella holiday music, and the most astounding a capella version of Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze”. I know this sounds bizarre, it was but it was great. Worth a night out if they ever come your way.</p>

<p>We also saw two movies this weekend – <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</a>, and <a href="http://www.abeautifulmind.com/">A Beautiful Mind</a>. Both great flicks.</p>

<p>If I had to choose between them and a night with The Bobs, The Bobs would win every time.</p>

<p>L begs to differ. She thought The Bobs were scary.</p>

<p>This is a super busy season for us – Thanksgiving, then L’s birthday on 11/20, then C’s birthday on 12/5, then J’s birthday on 12/15. Of course, Christmas and New Year’s coming.</p>

<p>Birthday highlights – L is heading to the <a href="http://www.kiss1061.com/jbb">Jingle Bell Bash</a> tonight with her friends for a big night out. Should be major fun. J took his group of friends to the <a href="http://www.illusionz.com/games.html">local lasertag emporium</a> – I think I enjoyed that as much as anyone. And on C’s birthday, the <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis/web/vortex/display?slug=ship06&amp;date=20011206&amp;query=christmas+ships">Christmas ships</a> stopped in front of our house and did their annual carol concert – wonderful timing.</p>

<p>Volleyball continues to keep L busy. Her high school team had their end of season awards banquet on Friday, and L won the Coach’s Award for the third year running, and she won awards for having the best service percentage and the greatest number of assists. Oh and she was named to the first team league all-star team. She is also getting busy now with her <a href="http://www.volleyballnw.com/JrVBclub/default.htm">club volleyball team</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday we all attended a Christmas singalong with the Choral Arts Northwest troupe at the <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/s-scripts/serve.pl">symphony hall</a> here in Seattle. A great time, C and I both loved their rendition of “still, still, still”. There is something about a great choir performance that is so uplifting.</p>

<p>Happy Holidays to you all.</p>

				<p><p><strong>College Thinking</strong></p>

<p>One constant theme of conversation in our house these days is college – in particular, where might L go.</p>

<p>I have no idea where L will ultimately decide to go – I am enjoying learning about schools with her and watching her think thru the decision. I am sure she will make a great choice.</p>

<p>One factor will certainly be our location. The West, and in particular the Pacific Northwest, is just not as well provisioned with lots of private universities and liberal arts schools, certainly not in the way that the Midwest or East is.</p>

<p>Working from North to South, some of the schools we have talked about in a positive light include:</p>

<p>- the <a href="http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> - <a href="http://web.reed.edu/">Reed College</a> - <a href="http://www.lclark.edu/">Lewis and Clark College</a> - <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> - <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a> - <a href="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford</a> - <a href="http://www.scu.edu/">Santa Clara University</a> - <a href="http://www.ucsb.edu/">UC Santa Barbara</a> - <a href="http://www.pepperdine.edu/main/">Pepperdine University</a> - <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a> - <a href="http://www.mckenna.edu/">Claremont McKenna</a> - <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a></p>

<p>Other schools we have considered but probably ruled completely out are Gonzaga, UC Santa Cruz, and Harvey Mudd. Interesting schools all but not a good fit.</p>

<p>And then there are some that we may learn more about – Caltech, Loyola Marymount, University of San Diego, University of Redlands.</p>

<p>All lists are very dynamic. I’ll try to keep you up to date.</p>
