<p>And SEC academic quality vs the Big10? Look at the <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/spp+50">USNews rankings</a>. Northwestern &gt; Vanderbilt. UM, Wisconsin, Illinois, PSU in top 50. OSU, MD in in top 60. Purdue, Rutgers, Minnesota, Iowa, MSU in top 75. Florida is first SEC showing (after Vandy) at 54, Georgia at 63, A&amp;M at 65. It is kind of a rout in favor of the Big10 actually. Gee just said the truth. Might be painful and indiscreet but seems true.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Traitor-His-Class-Privileged-ebook/dp/B001ANYDJ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368366369&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=traitor+to+his+class" title="Traitor to His Class">Traitor to His Class</a> by H. W. Brands. A fine biography of FDR. The title led me to believe that it would be a little more focused on the conflict between his policies and the monied elite, but it was really a general biography of the most influential president of the last century.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Strangers-Child-Vintage-International/dp/0307474348/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352238&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+stranger%27s+child">The Stranger’s Child</a> by Alan Hollinghurst. Snooty acclaim but I am giving up. The “oh my gosh they were secretly gay” idea just doesn’t do it for me anymore, you can’t carry a story on this point, it’s like trying to revolve a story around “he was secretly left-handed!”. Maybe 30 years ago this would have been interesting. Not now.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maske-Thaery-Jack-Vance/dp/0743475240/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352290&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=maske+thaery">Maske: Thaery</a> by Jack Vance. Classic 70’s science fiction, some sort of Vance appreciation society is pulling these out of the back catalog and getting them out in e-book form. His characters seem stilted and awkward, age hasn’t treated them well, and yet a compelling tale.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-5th-Wave-Rick-Yancey/dp/0399162410/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352338&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+5th+wave">The 5th Wave</a> by Rick Yancey. Beginning of a YA series about an alien invasion of Earth, appealing due to the shades of gray in the characters. I’d read more.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lucky-York-Review-Books-Classics/dp/1590175751/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352374&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lucky+jim">Lucky Jim</a> by Kingsley Amis. Eh. An over-ambitious grasper stumbles his way to success. The character is unappealing and I just don’t get him. Supposed to be funny.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-High-Crusade-Poul-Anderson/dp/1439133778/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352462&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+high+crusade">The High Crusade</a> by Poul Anderson. What a great fun book, a piece of classic science fiction that has aged very well. A blast.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Across-Sky-Nancy-Kress/dp/0765359561/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370352600&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=steal+across+the+sky">Steal Across the Sky</a> by Nancy Kress. A nice concept but the story doesn’t go particularly anywhere.</li>

				<p><p>I recently left my Kindle on a plane, and now I have to get a new one (or migrate to ipad or whatever, the device used is not the point).</p>

<p>I’ve purchased 515 books over the years and read many of them. It is a disaster getting just my unread or currently-reading books over to a new device. The “Manage your Kindle” web page has no indication of read status, I have to go through each title and figure out what to do with it. And I can’t group or organize on the webpage at all. A really terrible experience. And hasn’t improved in years. Amazon has done nothing for the core Kindle market, people that actually read a lot of books.</p>

<p>Annoyed. Wasting my time, Amazon.</p>

<p>Look at the first half of this schedule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aug. 30 - vs. Navy (at Baltimore’s M&amp;T Bank Stadium)</li>
  <li>Sept. 13 - Kent State</li>
  <li>Sept. 20 - Virginia Tech</li>
  <li>Sept. 27 - Cincinnati</li>
  <li>Oct. 4 - at Maryland</li>
  <li>Oct. 18 - Rutgers</li>
  <li>Oct. 25 - at Penn State</li>
</ul>

<p>You’d not be able to tell this team was in the Big10 based on this. The center of mass of this schedule is somewhere like Hagerstown, Maryland.</p>

				<p><p>So I’ve been acquiring and playing with 50-100 year old electrical lab instruments.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/freqmeter.jpg"><img src="images/freqmeter-300x225.jpg" alt="freqmeter" /></a>My latest is a <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_2/chpt_12/2.html">reed-type frequency meter</a>, I didn’t even know these things existed. Great admiration for the people who originally designed these things, a very clever little design. We tried a brief experiment to get it running today, but no response. We may not have been applying enough voltage, the wires in these things could probably handle 50+ amps.</p>

<p>I’ve also got this potentiometer<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/potentiometer.jpg"><img src="images/potentiometer-300x215.jpg" alt="potentiometer" /></a>, utterly crazy looking, and with controls and labels that are a mystery to me – terminals labeled E+ and E-, H and H1, L and L1, BA+, R, and a couple others. A big wonking selector switch that looks like it could transmit 50 amps, and a fine tuning gauge. I’ll be putting an ohmmeter on this thing to see what the hell is going on.</p>

<p>I’ve also got some more awesome potentiometers and voltmeters. As well as a variable capacitor. These things were built for the ages – massive wires, plenty of ventilation, solid wood and metal and bakelite construction. They are all amazingly beautiful.</p>

<p>I’m working to bond an arduino to some of these so I can use them for more mundane modern purposes. But they look great just sitting on the shelf.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Afterwards-A-Novel-Rosamund-Lupton/dp/0307716554/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366824603&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=afterwards">Afterwards</a> by Rosamund Lupton. A family is shattered by a school fire, and the critically injured mother battles to protect her kids and uncover the truth around the events. Great story about the relationship between a woman and her family, tested by extreme events. The voice used in the story is a little confusing at times – I read the Kindle version, I wonder if the printed version used typography to better set apart the actions and thoughts of various characters.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Standing-Another-Grave-Detective-Inspector/dp/0316224588/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366824842&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=standing+in+another+man%27s+grave">Standing in Another Man’s Grave</a> by Ian Rankin. Great detective tale featuring an abrasive self-destructive sleuth. I should read more in the series.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Thessaly-Deadly-Mystery-Mysteries/dp/0316217875/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366824968&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+doctor+of+thessaly">The Doctor of Thessaly</a> by Anne Zouroudi. Another great detective character and story. In both this tale and the Rankin, the leads care about justice and to hell with the rules. But they go about it totally different ways. The Rankin character is a blunt rusty knife, the Zouroudi character is a judo master. Fun stuff.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Beautiful-Forevers-Mumbai-Undercity/dp/1400067553/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367178907&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=behind+the+beautiful+forevers">Behind the Beautiful Forevers</a> by Katherine Boo. Fascinating but challenging read about life in the Mumbai slums. Challenging because the lives depicted are so brutal, the culture so corrupt. I’m left wrung out, and having no idea how to do anything about.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Rule-Law-Tom-Bingham/dp/014103453X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367643203&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rule+of+law">The Rule of Law</a> by Tom Bingham. Well written and pretty crisp, a nice coverage of what the phrase “the rule of law” means, its history, and implications for today. Worthwhile.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Skippy-Dies-Novel-Paul-Murray/dp/0865478619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367643315&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=skippy+dies">Skippy Dies</a> by Paul Murray. Eh. Teenage boys can be creeps, I don’t need a whole novel pointing this out over and over and over again.</li>

A rocking show – just his current small backing band of 3 women on drums, bass, and guitar. Opened with a few classics, including a nice variant on “I Could Never Take The Place of Your Man”. A lot of his new material. A nice cover of the Cars’ “Let’s Go” with a shout out to Boston. A really nice cover of “Crimson and Clover”. Along the way Prince was in great lead guitar form, and also picked up the bass at one point for a great solo.</p>

<p>He is a captivating performer. I’ve seen Jack White in a small venue and Buddy Guy, they both pour a lot of emotion into their guitar work, Prince is up there as well.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/trashcans.jpg"><img src="images/trashcans-300x199.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/techfun/" /></a>Everyone has written about forcing the stupid touchscreen down our throats, that annoys the heck out of me too. But maybe I can get used to it.</p>

<p>But moving beyond that, I just want to use a damn printer. There is nothing about printers on the home screen. When you type in “printers” it says it can’t find anything. Awesome. So I bring up the stupid f&amp;*king charms (because menus and ribbons and taskbars weren’t good enough ways to start programs, let’s invent a whole new system, yay), choose Settings, choose “Change PC Settings”. Oh there is nothing called “printers” in this list either. OK click on devices and you can add a device, and then it tries and tries to search for devices. Meanwhile it is showing me a crappy list of devices I do have – great I have a “HL_DT_ST BD-RE WH08LS20” installed, that is good to know. Oh and I have devices called “Microsoft XPS Document Writer” and “Send To OneNote 2013”. Where are those on my desk? Those are so much more important to me than my damn printer.</p>

<p>I know it isn’t cool and strategic to print anymore. But people still need to f&amp;*king print. I eventually found a way to add a printer but don’t ask me where the hell I found it.</p>

<p>Oh and the arduino software won’t install on it, apparently the arduino board is not trusted. To install it, you have to boot into the secret system setup mode which you get to deep in the control panel, and choose to turn off driver signing enforcement. Except this super secret startup mode hangs on my brand new machine and I have to power cycle. That is great, you certainly don’t want the most active community of tinkerers using your operating system.</p>

<p>Oh and I am using with dual monitors – one plain old monitor and one touchscreen. DON’T DO THIS. It sounded like a great idea, keep the new interface off in one screen in its little ghetto, and run all my real apps on the other screen. Except the touch interface is horribly confused now – a touch on my touch screen moves the pointer on my non-touch screen.</p>

<p>Yes I am doing perhaps somewhat niche-y things but Windows used to be good at that, damn it. It would run on anything and let you do anything. Now it is just an OSX/iOS wannabe and not very good at that.</p>

<p>Not in a good mood.</p>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghostman-Roger-Hobbs/dp/0307959961/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086673&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ghostman">Ghostman</a> by Roger Hobbs. Excellent thriller about a world-class thief trying to thread the needle between rival criminal organizations and law enforcement. Great character. I’d read more featuring.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Business-Model-Generation-Visionaries-Challengers/dp/0470876417/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086717&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=business+model+generation">Business Model Generation</a> by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur. I don’t read many popular business books, they are all so repetitive and derivative. This book wasn’t terrible – the authors aren’t trying to sell you on their thesis, but are giving you a compendium of tools for thinking about business models</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Garden-Evening-Mists-Tan-Twan/dp/1602861803/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086748&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+garden+of+evening+mists">The Garden of Evening Mists</a> by Tan Twan Eng. Excellent story about a young ethnic Chinese woman in Malaya during and after WWII. The intertwining of many cultures, the horrific treatment of groups by the rulers of the moment, and how everyone coped and survived. A window into a part of the world and its history of which I have been largely ignorant.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Our-Stars-John-Green/dp/0525478817/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086786&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+fault+in+our+stars">The Fault in Our Stars</a> by John Green. Two teenage cancer sufferers find love amidst their tragedy. Not an easy read but will grab you. Apparently under production as a movie.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extinction-Machine-Joe-Ledger-Novel/dp/0312552211/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086897&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=extinction+machine">Extinction Machine</a> by Jonathan Maberry. Eh. Super tough government agent violently unravels a conspiracy involving aliens. Not very original.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Path-Dagger-Coin/dp/0316080683/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086927&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+dragon%27s+path">The Dragon’s Path</a> by Daniel Abraham. High quality fantasy. Not quite as bold as Game of Thrones but pretty darn good with compelling characters and a bit lighter tone than Game of Thrones.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Double-Game-Dan-Fesperman/dp/0307700135/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086979&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+double+game">The Double Game</a> by Dan Fespeman. Held my attention but the motivations of main character seemed like nonsense.</li>

<p>So <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9096499/minnesota-gophers-dismiss-tubby-smith-day-ncaa-tourney-ouster">Minnesota fired Tubby</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/MedcalfByESPN">@MedcalfByESPN</a> is pretty clear that the real problem lies within the Minnesota athletic program and community – failure to build facilities, failure to support program, etc:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s the truth. Gophers need to invest a lot of money to right the ship. I’m gone. Feel free to disagree.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can get lost in Minneapolis. When the Gophers are good, everyone cares. When they’re not, they go away. That’s just how it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Gophers need so many additional resources to compete with the best teams in the Big Ten and the country. Limited investment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty classic mediocre team problem. The institution thinks it is a premier program, and thinks it deserves premier people and premier results. The truth is different.</p>
