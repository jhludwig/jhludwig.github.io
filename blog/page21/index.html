				<p><blockquote>
  <p>At Microsoft, our mission and values are to help people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft Corporate web site</a></p>

<p>Eh. This could be the mission statement of GE. Of Procter &amp; Gamble. Of a bank.</p>

<p>When I joined Microsoft in the late 80s, the mission was “a PC on every desk and in every home”. And this was exciting at the time. When I started my work career in the 80s, I was doing spreadsheets on paper, we were typing up documents on typewriters. It was thrilling to work on all the software pieces needed to bring PCs to everyone, I was thrilled to go to work every day. Decision making at work was pretty easy, everyone was pulling on the same oar. Recruiting was easy, people were drawn to the mission. Customers were excited. Developer partners were excited. The energy level was palpable.</p>

<p>And it wasn’t about the money. I took a 50% salary cut to join Microsoft and had no idea the stock would go on a decade long run. I was there for the thrill of it.</p>

<p>By the late 90s tho, the mission had been completed. And since then the company has done well, but the spark is gone. People have left. Infighting has increased. Developer interest has waned. I attribute this directly to the lack of a compelling mission (or missions, separate parts of the company might need separate missions). The current mission is just an umbrella statement to smear over everything, it compels no one, any action can be justified under it. And it doesn’t force any hard choices – no efforts can be focused or trimmed. Microsoft could justify making sunscreen and student loans as part of this mission.</p>

<p>This isn’t solely a SteveB issue. Sure he has been CEO and so ultimately he bears responsibility. But he hasn’t been working alone in a closet. The board has been there the last decade, including Bill, while the company has rumbled along without a mission, and seen its relevance erode. If the board has decided that change is needed, then they need to look at themselves too, as they have been complicit in the direction of the enterprise.</p>

<p>Changing the leadership isn’t going to help the company unless there is a commitment to work on the mission with all that means – organizational fallout, potential divestments, etc.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Steve_Ballmer.jpg"><img src="images/Steve_Ballmer.jpg" alt="Steve_Ballmer" /></a>There are going to be a kajillion articles written dissecting Steve’s legacy at Microsoft, and a kajillion articles speculating on who and what are next for Microsoft. All super interesting and entertaining, though I bet that the results will largely be invariant – Microsoft ends up being largely a highly profitable enterprise company, and some consumer assets get spun out to an uncertain future.</p>

<p>Personally though I am most interested in what Steve is going to do next. Bill Gates and Paul Allen have had outsized impacts on the local economy and culture post their Microsoft years. Steve is passionate, cares deeply, is good hearted. I can’t see him spending the next 30 years fishing or building model railroad setups. I am hopeful that he engages with the Seattle community and the Northwest in a positive way, and I’m interested to see how he applies his energy. This could be a very positive outcome for Seattle.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/ubuntu-edge-looks-doomed-but-canonical-cuts-cost-of-making-the-phone/">Ubuntu Edge looks doomed</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t think the Canonical guys are stupid, and it would have taken about 4 seconds of analysis to figure out that a $32M crowd funding campaign was not going to ever work. So I assume they already knew that. So what is their game?</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are getting lots of free press for themselves and for the idea of a Ubuntu phone, so that is good for them.</li>
  <li>If they had no intention of ever producing this phone, or seeing it produced, it would be dumb to stir up excitement and interest.</li>
  <li>So I assume that there is a plan, regardless of the Indiegogo campaign, to get this phone produced.</li>
  <li>Canonical may be using the press and interest to raise capital via other channels, that would make sense.</li>
  <li>Or they may have a partner on the hook to produce the phone, and the partner needs a little goading.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way or another, I suspect this phone is coming out, or something very much like it.</p>

I think they were super thoughtful about the whole process, and I’m excited to see the product, I am of course a backer.</p>

<p>And it has become clear to me what Kickstarter is really for. It is not about raising money. These guys raised a modest amount, they could have funded this easily themselves or from friends. But they have built a great community of early adopters and backers, who feel like part of the team, who are going to help evangelize the product, who are influentials. And that is what Kickstarter really seems to be about (for tech products, I am clueless about movies or other domains) – it is in some sense a marketing expense, it is the way you reach out to the influentials and early adopters and get them on board and pulling for you, which is a HUGELY valuable asset for a young company. It is certainly not about the cash – the $147K these guys raised, less the Kickstarter and AMZN fees, is nothing compared to the funding needs of the business.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Stories-American-Literature-Series/dp/1564786021/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371093344&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=joseph+mcelroy">Night Soul and Other Stories</a> by Joseph McElroy. I just don’t enjoy short stories. These seem well-written and intriguing, but the lack of plot and character development due to the strictures of the form just doesn’t work for me. Giving up.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Portobello-A-Novel-Ruth-Rendell/dp/B0076TP3C8/ref=sr_1_27?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371913745&amp;sr=8-27&amp;keywords=ruth+rendell">Portobello</a> by Ruth Rendell. Given the author I expected a straight up mystery but this is an odd little tale of characters along Portobello Road and their obsessions and delusions and misbehaviors. Enjoyable but not hard-hitting.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Dervish-House-Ian-McDonald/dp/1616145455/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373382811&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+dervish+house">The Dervish House</a> by Ian McDonald. Somehow in my trip through the science fiction canon I have missed McDonald, and that has been a mistake. A good tale of a near future Istanbul awash in nano tech. The characters and ideas were much better than the plot, the story got a little too Dan Brown-ish in parts for me, and overall there were too many moving parts. A better book is in here, focused on just 1-2 of the characters and their stories. But still, a good read.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Firmin-Sam-Savage/dp/0385342659/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374076534&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=firmin">Firmin</a> by Sam Savage. I had no memory of why I bought this book, but what a quirky little tale. A hyper intelligent rat aspires to rise above his essential rat nature, with inevitable triumphs and crashing failures. Not unlike our own lives. Enjoyable.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last book reminds me of how valuable it is to search out small publishers and see what they are emitting. <a href="http://coffeehousepress.org">Coffee House</a>, <a href="https://www.graywolfpress.org">Graywolf</a>, etc. With the consolidation among the major publishers and the collapse of retail book selling, you can’t rely on the mainstream to bring interesting writing to you.</p>

How awesome, even if it is not really meant in tribute.</p>

<p>This was the first shipping product I worked on at Microsoft. A great great team of people. I remember how surprised we all were on the product team when the product was marketed at launch as a “Notes Killer”. We were just trying to make networking work within Windows, because up to that point, networking install for Windows was a ball buster.</p>

<p>I still have a WFW screwdriver.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">09 July 2013</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>So we haven’t received mail for about a week and I stopped at the post office, a 1 month temporary vacation hold was placed on our mail. The hold was placed at the USPS website, anyone can do this, there is no security. They had my name and address correct tho they supplied a NYC cell phone number as a contact number. Or maybe it was just a random number.</p>

<p>So I am trying to figure out if this is some sort of scam, was someone intending to pick up my mail (because no valid ID was demanded to pick it up), or were they planning on having it redelivered somewhere (tho the hold order had it being delivered at the end of the month to my address)?</p>

<p>Or was this just a db error at the post office?</p>

<p>I don’t seem to find anything on the internet about vacation mail hold scams but very curious.</p>

<p>We had a very nice visit at <a href="http://www.firwoodfarmalpacas.com/">Firwood Farms</a> today, this place is an unassuming little gem. Way off the beaten path, and not very commercial, but a hugely nice and good couple who own the place and make a home for rescue alpacas (as well as some of their own). And the alpacas are so engaging, very interested in meeting us (we did have food in our hands), and not shy a bit, tho a little cautious. Their eyes are stunning. This place is about 1000x more meaningful and touching than any zoo. Worth a side trip.</p>
