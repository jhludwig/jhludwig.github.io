    <p>I’ve been wretling with a Dell portable this month that has had intermittent network access problems. I finally hit on a solution kind of randomly and the Dell support forums suggest that maybe it is the fault of the Internet Connection Wizard – <a href="http://forums.us.dell.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=insp_network&amp;message.id=14403" title="Re: Inspiron 8500 -- disabling Network Bridge - Inspiron - Network - Dell Community Forum">Re: Inspiron 8500 – disabling Network Bridge - Inspiron - Network - Dell Community Forum</a> – hard to believe but something clearly did establish a bridge on this machine and it has made networking unreliable. Why would I ever want to bridge networks on my laptop – sure I supposed there is a geek reason to do it, but why would a “wizard” ever leave me in this config?</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/11/06/latest-pc-buying-experience.html">Latest PC buying experience</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Bought a PC yesterday at <a href="http://www.pcclub.com/" title="PC Club - Where Computer Professionals Go">PC Club - Where Computer Professionals Go</a>-- a mini-ITX form factor box. Right across the street from a CompUSA which I also shopped at. Wow the experience between the two was so different.</p>

<p>At PC Club, the store is a little cr@phole of a store in a strip mall. Spartan interior with gear just laying around everywhere. Handwritten signs everywhere. The staff ignored me until I cornered one. And then they knew exactly what I was talking about and had me out the door in 10 minutes with my purchase.</p>

<p>The CompUSA was the standard glossy CompUSA. Tons of inventory. The staff descended on me. One guy claimed me as his and helped me find the monitor I needed. (I had been in earlier in the day and had asked for mini-ITX systems and gotten a blank look. In fact tho they had two different ones in stock). The guy pushed me hard to get an extended warranty, cutting prices on some minor items I bought, and in fact booking some of my purchase as an extended warranty on speakers – he was trying to win some in-store contest. And checkout took FOREVER because he drug me over to the business center checkout, away from the regular retail checkout, again to win some stupid instore contest. A painful experience.</p>

    <p>Tonight’s Halloween lesson. If you apply 60 PSI to a steel cylinder with a cross section of ~7 square inches, with the intent of opening and closing a coffin; and if you build the coffin out of cheap-ass plywood with wood glue and light screws and with some soft pine fittings to anchor the cylinder at either end, what happens? Well basically your coffin explodes.</p>

<p>Tonight’s excercise was coffin plan B – reconstruct coffin, have the pneumatic cylinder push off ground at one end and against the coffin lid at the other end, allowing that end to float freely against the lid.</p>

<p>Oh this was on top of my lesson sunday night which was “What happens if you apply 120v AC to a 24v DC solenoid valve?” Well the solenoid works for a little while…then it magically isn’t a solenoid any more. Good thing my solenoid valves came in a gang package of 7 – two to burn out, one to break a fitting in, leaving 4 that actually work!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/10/24/halloween-status-bit-errors-in-dmx-decoders.html">Halloween status -- bit errors in DMX decoders</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Tried to fire up all my halloween props last night. Lots of setup errors – the lightning strobe fired when i turned on my tombstone uplights; the tombstone uplights lit when I tried to fire the doghouse fog machine; the doghouse fog machine didn’t ever fire.</p>

<p>After much head scratching I determined that I had some bit errors in the DIP switches controlling DMX settings on the various devices. The doghouse address was off by 2 suggesting that the 2nd switch is shorted, and i never could get the strobe to respond to any programmed address so i turned all the switches off and it responds to its default address, 1. Not surprising that the gear is suffering from 4 years of wet fall weather here. I may need to replace a few items next year.</p>

<p>As of this moment tho, all lighting and effects are functioning – tombstone uplights; haunted tree; several banks of lightning effect lights and strobes; my four fog systems; and my two solenoids for animating my casket.</p>

<p>Also did a lot of pneumatic debugging today. My exploding cauldron is working nicely; my coffin animation is working. I had to take down my air cannon tho – it was WAY too powerful for my intended effect, I would have been driving everyone out of the yard. I need to rethink its use for next year.</p>
