<p>I really agree with his articulation of the consumer disaster scenario – lost kid photos are going to drive people batty. I am not convinced that datacenter-based service is the right answer. Something like foldershare might be the more economic answer for most people.</p>

<p>Oh and Netgear support is unresponsive. And I even tracked down the email addresses for the technical managers at Zetera, the software provider to netgear, and those guys were unresponsive.</p>

<p>So I give up. I’ve uninstalled the client software on all machines but one. That machine is the only machine connecting to the Sc101, and then that machine is resharing the drives out to other machines. Looking now for a good NAS.

<p>What observations do I make?</p>

<p>* This is a big business, and getting bigger. * There is a dramatic difference between the top and bottom revenue producers in just this list, and this is the cream of the crop. The bottom tier Div1A schools are way behind * Ohio State players must be sleeping on silk sheets and eating Kobe beef at every meal. (Note that there are a lot of uncategorized revenues and expenses at every school so this could be just a matter of different approaches to cost and revenue allocation) * Texas and Ohio State are the revenue goliaths. * West Virginia is the model of efficiency – great results on a (relative) shoestring. Cost of living must be low in Morgantown. * USC needs to hire someone to focus on their business. How can they have the on field results and the brand they have, and yet be so far behind in revenue generation?</p>

<p>I need to stand up for myself a little bit tho. My “check scores 40 times during a game” estimate was just a quick estimate by me, and is probably way off. In actuality if it is a game I care about, I check the play by play results every minute, so a realistic estimate is more like 100-200 times a game. I know, pathetic.</p>

<p>I bet I am not alone tho. I wonder why no one has done an ass-kicking mobile app to track baseball, football, basketball play by play.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Having problems getting this net-attached storage device to work. Fully documenting my case here so the Netgear support folks can see it.</p>

<p>* Config: Netgear SC101, serial # 16W3594U00994. Hosting two Seagate Barracuda 7200 400 GB ST3400832A drives which are on the supported drive list. Running the latest firmware, 4.14.0 * Client PCs: I’ve installed the admin utility on 3 different WinXP Pro with all latest patches. Running the latest version of the SCM utility – 1.5.5 * Running DHCP on my LAN. * When running the SCM utility, I can see the two hard disks. Separate IPs – 192.168.168.90 and 192.168.168.91. I can see that each disk has 372.6G available. * In either wizard or advanced mode, I can select a disk and try to create a drive. I have tried a variety of drive sizes from 120G up to 372.6G. In all cases I am trying to create a shared, no password, non-mirrored drive. * when I try to create the drive, the utlity tells me it is allocating space, and stays in this state forever. “forever” is at least 12 hours because I let it run overnight and it never completed. * the utility does appear to create a partition with my desired name. but the partition is not recognizable as a mountable drive by the SCM utility, and is marked as non-shared.</p>

<p>Let me know if more detail needed.</p>

<p>UPDATE: working. I connected the SC101 up with my existing LAN cable which was a patch cable. The old PC in its place knew how to deal with this. The SC101 apparently didn’t. When I switched cables, all was well.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://store.qkits.com/moreinfo.cfm/MX056">Simple Dimmer</a>. Lots of other kits and components here too. * <a href="http://www.parallaxefx.com/">Simple prop controllers</a> and some nice application notes like <a href="http://www.parallaxefx.com/dl/AppNotes/AppNoteFX00002.zip">this skull idea</a> (zipped pdf) * I’m sure I’ve blogged this before, <a href="http://www.hauntmasterproducts.com/9.html">the hauntmaster controller</a> – “The Flex ECT is an externally triggered, dual timer that is connected between a sensor (switch) and the electrically operated event device as shown in the diagram to the right” * Plans to <a href="http://www.hauntedillinois.com/fogtimer.php">build your own event control timer.</a> * A range of <a href="http://www.luxeonstar.com/">LED fixtures and drivers</a>. Seems like all halloween lighting should move to LED over time? * Some hints in here on <a href="http://www.deathlord.net/Lynching/lynch8.htm">silencing pneumatic solenoids</a> – the exhaust noise doesn’t really bother me but maybe I will want to do this some day. * Some <a href="http://www.biasedopinion.com/lighting.aspx">very basic intro guides to haunt lighting</a> * <a href="http://www.animatedlighting.com/products/buildyourownshow.asp">Lighting control units</a>. These look like overkill to me, better for Christmas applications.</p>

				<p><p>* “Appointment in Samarra”:amazon by John O’Hara. Great look at smalltown society – the machinations, the viciousness, the artificial stratifications. A much better book than “The Great Gatsby”:amazon, maybe because the setting maps better to my hometown. * “The Truth (With Jokes)”:amazon by Al Franken. Al has done more to move me towards a more liberal viewpoint than anyone. He cracks me up. His attacks on corrupt and two-faced politicians are truly hilarious. Delay and Frist take a beating. He does go in the ditch on social security funding – Al is not much of an economist or mathematician, the notion of “present value” completely escapes him. And somehow he thinks that there is a real fund backing social security – somehow it is ok with him that the social security “fund” is fully invested in US treasury securities; this is to me akin to the GM pension fund being 100% invested in GM stock, a practice which has been judged to be very bad. I actually agree with most of Al’s views on social security funding but he really botches his handling of this discussion. But when he sticks to character and integrity issues, he is generally dead on. And he throws in just enough humility and self-deprecating humour to make himself credible. * “The Wrong Side of Paris”:amazon by Honore de Balzac. Outstanding book. A great break from American and British period fiction – the moral calculus of the characters is so different. You have to wonder why we are seeing the 97th remake of pride and prejudice in the theatres, why is no one dipping into this vein of literature. Ok I am ignorant about the french film making industry, maybe this story has been filmed 6 times. * Oh and a list – <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4660">the top 20 geek novels</a>. I’ve read too many.</p>

				<p><p>OK now that I am off the high of the Michigan game, what’s next? Let’s assume enough of the BCS top 6 win out, ie there is no way for The OSU to jump to the #2 position. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/stewart_mandel/11/21/bowl.projections/index.html">Si.COM says OSU will get left out of the BCS mix, pushed out by Oregon and ND</a> – the claim being that the Fiesta Bowl holds all the cards and that they may be tired of The OSU.</p>

<p>After a <a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org/index2.cfm?page=eligibility">careful reading of the BCS selection rules</a>, I don’t get it. The Fiesta loses Texas to the Rose and so they get first pick to replace. They can pick any BCS eligible team. I think the game is all about avoiding WVU as they are the worst TV draw. So the Fiesta can pick Penn State as their first team. Then they have to list 3 choices for their second team, and WVU as a conf champ has to be at least their #2 pick. And the Orange wins tiebreakers, so assuming both the Orange and the Fiesta choose ND as their first choice, the Fiesta gets WVU (or even worse, USF!!).</p>

<p>Alternatively, the Fiesta could pick ND as their first team, and then they have to list Penn State and WVU as their top two choices in their list of three. Again they lose the tiebreaker to the Orange and end up with WVU.</p>

<p>Either way it seems like the Sugar ends up with the last choice and (assuming The OSU falls this far) will get to pick between The OSU or Oregon. And it has been a while since The OSU has been to the Sugar.</p>
