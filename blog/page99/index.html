    <p>OK I have a problem with XP SP2. All my remote desktop sessions have quit working. I’ve tweaked firewall settings on client and server side, making sure the “remote desktop” button was checked. But doesn’t seem to be working. Very bummer. No obvious threads on this problem that I can find on google or msdn – there is some discussion about extra work needed to permit remote desktop sessions as part of netmeeting, but these tips seem to be specific to netmeeting. Hmm.</p>

    <p>Last year when we put a machine on the <a href="http://www.pomona.edu">Pomona</a> network, it was the wild wild west – no control over what machines were on the net, how configured, etc. It’s no surprise that by the end of the year, the machine we put on the net was loaded with spyware and other cruft.</p>

<p>This year, the <a href="http://www.its.pomona.edu/" title="Pomona College - Information Technology Services">Pomona College - Information Technology Services</a> has a way stricter system in place. When an unregistered machine is placed on the net, all its browser traffic is redirected immediately to an internal site which forces the user to:</p>

<p>* install Xp sp2 * does a vulnerability scan * forces review of use policies * takes a system inventory * slams on windows update * forces an av install if no av is present (sophos) * registers the nic and ties it to a student ID * encourages spybot and ad-aware install</p>

<p>A marked step up in making the network secure for students. As well as allowing the school to track all student network use which may be a mixed blessing for everyone (actually what is mixed about it? it just seems bad.)</p>

I’m surprised MSFT hasn’t seen the business opportunity here – they have the scale and infrastructure to handle update delivery and install for all Windows apps – they should run the update service for all ISVs (and of course charge them a modest fee for the service – this is worth something to ISVs and users). I’d sure rather have just one updater running on my machine rather than the billions of them that try to run now.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/doom/doom3/" title="id Software: DOOM 3">id Software: DOOM 3</a> – fun, but nearly unplayable without the sound cranked and without surround sound. The game relies on a constant stream of monsters popping up behind you, and if you can’t hear it happening, the game just isn’t as much fun. It’s actually kind of a cheap monster system, I prefer the more realistic AI in far cry, but doom3 is still a good timewaster.</p>

<p>Update: OK I joined and tried it out. I admire it’s simplicity. But…I already have a way that I post links with notes and tags – that is called my blog. I don’t want another site I have to dupe all this effort at. I want something that looks at my blog posts, compares those with posts of others, and gives me the union of all that posting activity – I guess that is technorati.</p>

    <p>34 miles into our drive to LA and we hit a big whomping chunk of metal in the road – and there goes a tire. Could have been worse – we were right at the Federal Way exit; later in the drive in southern Oregon or central California we might have had a real long wait.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://www.aaa-calif.com/" title="Automobile Club of Southern California - We're Always With You">AAA service</a> was great – great call center, quick arrival, found an open tire center for us, took us right there. Well worth the annual membership fee.</p>
