Some of the central thinking about the nature of uncertainty and the human inability to correctly assess risk and act on risk is very important; but as with most nonfiction books, this tome could have been at least 50% shorter, and the author’s style sometimes gets in the way of understanding. I don’t mind the snarky humour but the pedantic nature of some sections gets old – it is as if it is not enough that the reader open his mind to the writer’s ideas, but that the reader must accept them fully and displace all others.

				<p><p>A solid opening for the season, though just reinforced that we should never ever schedule FCS opponents, there is just no upside. My pregame pick was 44-0 so not feeling too bad.</p>

<p>* At the QB position, Boeckman looked efficient tho at times continues to underthrow the receiver – are the coaches really encouraging him to do this? Against tougher opponents this just seems dumb. Pryor looked great on runs and short passes – he can zip the ball. Not there yet on longer passes and at times made poor decisions to run under pressure. But clearly a talent. * Beanie, beanie, beanie. Honestly, why was he still playing at the time of his injury? The highest paid coach in the Big 10 should have had him out once he hit 100 yards. Hopefully it is just a sprain. The backup running backs played well. * Nice to see a shutout, nothing else would have served against this opponent * Nice to see some kicking practice</p>

<p>Upwards and onwards.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">27 August 2008</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK I don’t know that I am going to pull off our regular Halloween setup this year. But if you want to set up a haunt in the neighborhood, well here is how I’d start. You can get crazy creative about the kind of scene you want to create – but nothing beats a graveyard. And to have a great graveyard you need to have tombstones.</p>

<p>You can buy tombstones from all kinds of retailers – Halloween specialty stores, Home Depot, garden stores, your drugstore will all carry some, mostly all with the message RIP. Some of these look good and there is nothing wrong with picking some up. The more elaborate ones can get spendy but they may be worth it.</p>

<p>But you can also make your own. Start with sheets of <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;productId=100320308&amp;N=10000003+90044+527397">foamboard</a> – use foamboard, not a styrofoam board which is crumbly and hard to glue together. This stuff is very carveable, you can cut out as simple or elaborate a form as you want. And you can carve designs in the face, you can bond pieces together to make pedestals (with the right glue), etc – here are <a href="http://wolfstone.halloweenhost.com/HalloweenTech/grsmak_GraveStones.html">some ideas</a>, and <a href="http://mov.dx.cx/halloween/carving/">some more</a>. Personally I like to rough up the edges of mine a lot, and i even break some and reglue them for added ruggedness. BTW, wear a good mask when you do all this, fumes and particles come off the foamboard and it is probably a nasty biohazard.</p>

<p>For epitaphs, you can carve them in now prior to painting, or paint them on later, or mix the techniques. I do some of all. If you need ideas for epitaphs, well the web is full of them, just search for “epitaphs” or “funnny epitaphs”.</p>

<p>After you have shapes, you will need to paint. I use the cheapest paint I can find in the “Oops” bin at Home Depot as a base, and then finish with one of the various stone effect spray paints. Now, some of the stone effects don’t survive rain well, so experiment. And again, wear a mask, spray paint is nasty.</p>

<p>At this point you now have tombstones! Lean against walls, mount with stakes into the ground, whatever your surface allows. Note that they don’t weigh much, and if you are at a windy site, well, you are going to have a lot of movement.</p>

<p>In future posts I’ll layout simple lighting and sound plans.</p>

				<p><p>* “Watchmen”:amazon by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Wow, excellent. Better as a graphic novel than it could have been as a book, the use of text and font and images to intertwine multiple stories works very well. You have to think as you read. * “Where Are The Customer’s Yachts?”:amazon by Fred Schwed Jr. Timeless classic, its crtiticism of the financial services industry and customers’ foolishness is still dead on. * “Broken Angels”:amazon By Richard K Morgan. Another Kovacs novel, this one wasn’t a home run for me. With all the morally ambiguous factions, I could never quite get Kovacs’ motivations. And his drawn out death postponed by one miracle drug after another quit working for me. The whole thing felt a little choppy and unmotivated. * “Biomechanics of the Gastrointestinal Tract”:amazon by Hans Gregersen. Interesting reference on the GI tract, treating it as a mechanical device and analyzing behaviour from that view. Useful to help you build up a complete picture.</p>
