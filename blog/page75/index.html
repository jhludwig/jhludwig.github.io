    <p>OK our first 360 bit the dust. locks up 1 minute after booting. 7 months into owning it – just out of the warranty phase. so $129 to get it fixed – this must be the microsoft strategy for making money, $129 every six months…</p>

<p>I considered buying a new one at the msft company store but they don’t seem to have them, and i am not sure the discount would be anything special.</p>

<p>the real pain is the amount of time to get it fixed. they are shipping us a mailing box, it will take 3-5 business days to arrive. then another 3-5 to return to them. then 3-5 to fix and 3-5 to get back. so a month gone. during summer vacation high season. not good.</p>

    <p>Clever bastards – <em><a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/06/price_discrimin.html">Ross Parker has discovered that on at least one website prices differ depending on how you ask your search to be ordered.

  <h1><a href="/2006/06/29/what-if-vms-were-free.html">What if VMs were free?</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>So much to read on virtualization these days – here’s a nice blog – <a href="http://www.virtualization.info/" title="virtualization.info">virtualization.info</a>.</p>

<p>Put me to wondering – what if it were free to bring up VMs on your machine? Where “free” means very inexpensive in performance terms.</p>

<p>I wonder if we wouldn’t architect our OSes very differently. Why jam all the advanced support for graphics hardware, and the attendant instability, into mainstream Windows? My web browser and mail client just don’t benefit from it. Wouldn’t I rather just bring up a separate VM that has all my xbox-like features and nothing else?</p>

<p>I really wonder if in the face of cheap virtualization, you wouldn’t design OSes very differently. Rather than having a general purpose OS with all the features needed for every class of app, perhaps you would instead design for very special purpose VMs with a smaller set of OS features – this VM profile for games, that one for productivity apps, another for running all your firewalling and security goo, etc etc.</p>

    <p>Looking at some cars to add to the household – the sweet spot is the $32K sedan.</p>

Good interior styling, good safety, good handling and performance. And all seem like good values, you get a lot for your dollar.</p>

<p>We wanted to like the <a href="http://www.toyota.com/avalon/index.html">Toyota Avalon</a> but the handling just wasn’t there – this thing wallows thru the turns. Styling and features are decent but not handling. We wanted to like the <a href="http://www.chrysler.com/300/">Chrysler 300</a> also and it handles nicely, has a great powertrain, and looks good on the outside, but the interior styling and fit-and-finish are 10 years behind.</p>

<p>And the <a href="http://www.cadillac.com/cadillacjsp/model/gallery.jsp?model=cts">Cadillac CTS</a> – what an embarrassment. A salesperson who hasn’t heard yet that Cadillac no longer is the pacesetter; overpriced, and underfeatured. I would feel stupid buying this car.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2006/06/21/the-strange-death-of-liberal-england.html">The Strange Death of Liberal England</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I’ve had “The Strange Death of Liberal England”:amazon by George Dangerfield on my “to read” shelf for years, something about the title intrigued me. But the idea of actually reading an in-depth tome on british history from 1910-1914 was pretty offputting.</p>

<p>Well I finally cracked the book last week. What a marvel. A seriously engaging book. History, but written almost lyrically at times – it felt as if Faulkner was writing history, with moments of dry British snarkiness. The last chapter takes a complete right turn, introduces the life, early death, and poetry of Rupert Brooke, and somehow makes it a relevant metaphor for all of Britain.</p>

<p>Along the way you learn more than you thought you wanted to know about Asquith, the House of Lords, Parliament, the trade unions, the suffragette movement (those were some bad-ass women!), the early days of the modern Irish state, etc, etc. Not a light breezy read, but an excellent book.</p>

    <p>Hey <a href="http://www.flock.com">this</a> feels pretty good. Light and zippy. Blog integration is decent tho a few bugs and shortcomings.  Nice importation of all firefox settings.  I don’t think I will stick with it quite yet because of the problems listed below but it is a great attempt. </p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve come to depend on the IETab firefox plugin and flock doesn’t support yet, so that is a major bummer</li>
  <li>The blogging feature doesn’t allow me to set category or keywords on an entry so that is a non-starter.  oh wait i guess it does, tho not in the entry editting window but in another window that pops up when you try to publish – kind of odd</li>

    <p>I get a lot of visitors looking for info on the best college stadiums. Well here are some pointers to web resources:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.hhweb.com/stadiumphotos_college.htm" title="College Stadiums Football Photos 8x10">College Stadiums Football Photos 8x10</a> – nice aerial and in-stadium photos for a lot of the top stadiums. Great gift for fans. * <a href="http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/Internet/attendance/ia_attendance.html">NCAA attendance stats for 2005</a> – a loud full stadium is a good stadium * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892048050/102-3127790-0050535?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Saturday Shrines</a> on Amazon. * <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/big12/003365.php">Fanblogs points to</a> Dennis Dodd’s 2003 rankings which I think are crap. <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005536.php">Fanblogs also points to the Rivals 05 rankings</a> which I like better. * <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/">Sporting News/MSNBC rankings</a> here which I also wonder about. * <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCL/is_4_32/ai_94123522">Football Digest rankings</a> – I can get behind these!</p>

<p>My view is – any full loud stadium on a Saturday afternoon or evening is a great place to be. I haven’t been to that many, but my views on a few:</p>

<p>* Ohio Stadium – great crowd, great band, great pageantry, great architecture. A+. What did you think I’d say? * Michigan Stadium – great crowd, but kind of characterless architecture. B+ * ASU in Tempe. What a great setting. Too bad the team isn’t consistently better. B+ * UW. Another great setting, but a team that is a snoozer. Still where else can you moor your boat for a tailgate picnic? B * Rose Bowl. Great potential but too many empty seats – not being on campus hurts. B- * Pitt Stadium. Great location, right in the thick of things. Great crowds, inconsistent team. B</p>

    <p>* “No Second Chance”:amazon by Harlan Coben. Another great whirlwind mystery by coben. Man no one writes an airline reading book like this guy. * “Guerilla Warfare”:amazon by Che Guevara. Interesting as a historical read, insight into the thinking of a very influential figure in the americas. Uplifting in many ways, a strong advocate for the people, and very anti-terrorism – contrast with the revolutionaries in the news these days. <em>I faced a dilemma when I finished this book – i travel with light paperbacks and usually leave them sitting in the airport or hotel, hoping that they will find their way into the hands of another reader rather than collecting dust on my shelves. But dropping a book named “Guerilla Warfare” in an airport, a book which includes pictures on how to modify a rifle to launch Molotov cocktails – well I figured it would freak someone out and have some probability of causing some crazy law enforcement scramble. So I threw it in the trash sadly.</em> * “Manhunt”:amazon by James L Swanson. Great accounting of Booth’s actions and escape. If he hadn’t broken his leg jumping to the stage, he’d have escaped and wouldn’t that have been dramatic.</p>

A better use of my time than <a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/home/home.htm">Oblivion</a>.</p>

<p>I’d be studying materials science because things like the following fascinate me:</p>

<p>* Batteries that recharge in seconds – <a href="http://www.sciencentral.com/articles/view.php3?type=article&amp;article_id=218392803" title="ScienCentral Video News: Super Battery">ScienCentral Video News: Super Battery</a> * Massive increases in data density on disks – <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news69077904.html">heat-assisted data storage</a> * Just because you can make them – <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/270368_buckyball16.html">gold buckyballs</a></p>

    <p>An interesting experiement – <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2006/06/virtualization_.html#comment-18347696" title="The Furrygoat Experience: Virtualization (Portable XP?)">The Furrygoat Experience: Virtualization (Portable XP?)</a> – someone is going to figure out the consumer use scenario for VM technology and make a lot of money. The ideas of portability, disposability, malware resistance are so powerful and so relevant for the broad consumer market.</p>

And as I sit here dreaming about being able to use Google Spreadsheet, that is the one function I want.”</p>

<p>Me too. I use half a dozen machines regularly, i use kiosk machines, I want all my docs everywhere. And I don’t need all the features of high-end office apps. Writely is fine for me, I am sure an online spreadsheet will be good enough too. And I am so tired of installing software on machines.</p>
