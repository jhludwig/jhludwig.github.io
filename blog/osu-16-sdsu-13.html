	<title>OSU 16, SDSU 13 – A Little Ludwig Goes a Long Way</title>
	<meta name="description" content="ESPN.com - NCF - Recap - San Diego State at Ohio State - 09/06/2003 – a horrific showing. 12 penalties, i think 9 or 10 in the first half alone. Poor sportsmanship – a lot of unnecessary personal fouls, Tressel should have sat Will Smith the rest of the game for some of the fouls he committed. The line was pushed around aby SDSU. SDSU had a good game plan with delays and traps and draws, OSU looked confused and outhit. Krenzel was incredibly ineffective. Way off on passes, especially anything longer than 10 yards. The running game was weak.

The defense finally stood up and saved the day, forcing turnovers and bottling up SDSU. The offense never did show up – no one on offense should earn a leaf for their helments this week.

Were the buckeyes looked ahead to NC State? Not as much as NC State was looking ahead to the Buckeyes, as NC State dropped their game to Wake Forest.

Let’s hope Tressel and the team use this to motivate themselves for next week.
