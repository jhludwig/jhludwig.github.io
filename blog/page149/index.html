				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">26 April 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>For fun, went to the WinHEC blogger lunch today. Hosted by Joe Peterson, a great guy I worked with years ago. Well attended, probably thanks to the nice lunch at <a href="http://www.tulio.com/">Tulio</a>.</p>

<p>Joe opened with a message about community – how important the blogger and developer community was to Microsoft and how important events like this are. Talked about the recent 64bit Windows release. And for longhorn, mentioned a beta in early summer, beta2 in fall, and release to manufacturing next summer.</p>

<p>Questions from the bloggers present for Joe and team:</p>

<p>* Tagging in longhorn. How does this work without WinFS? Where are tags stored (in the files as file formats permit)? What about tag collisions (bummer. some talk about per-user tags but sounded like it won’t be in the product)? Personally I don’t get the excitement about tags in the audience or among the blog community, I don’t think users really want to use tags – they just want free text search. * Sidebar? cut for now. * Working to improve multimonitor support by pulling more out of display-specific drivers and into general level. display driver stability a big goal * By default, users will operate in “protected admin” and “standard user” rights levels – prompts for installs and admin ops. * Longhorn target – work on 256m system, prob will reco 512. 1gig proc. Will work with all old drivers. * Skinnable ui? working to add more skinnable features. * Dev team is purchasing only 64bit machines going forward. Daily builds of both, will simship both, you’ll be able to choose. For my money – if the dev team is running 64bit machines, then that is what I want to run, I know they will make that work well. * Will virtualpc ship in longhorn? Looking at.</p>

<p>All in all a great lunch. Thanks Joe et al.</p>

				<p><p>Spent a couple nice days there this week. Great weather. Here are some essential links:</p>

<p>* Getting there. <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/current/index.cfm?route=ana-sj&amp;direction=west">WSDOT Ferry schedules</a> – read the footnotes carefully as there are a lot of intricacies in Lopez service. If you don’t need a car on the island, <a href="http://www.paracletecharters.com">Paraclete Charters</a> is a great way to go – avoid the ferry lines, and they can drop you anywhere, and they are nice people. * Staying. <a href="http://www.lopezfarmcottages.com/">Lopez Farm Cottages</a> are delightful – clean, completely invisible staff, lots of wild bunnies to entertain you. * Eating. The <a href="http://sanjuanislands.kulshan.com/Washington/San_Juan_County/Lopez_Island/Lopez_Village/Restaurants/Love_Dog_Cafe.htm">Love Dog Cafe</a> is great – we had a great halibut dinner, they do great pizzas, good crabcakes, pastas, etc. Holly ‘s Bakery is great for deserts and pastries. Isabel’s for your coffee fix. Vita’s for takeout sandwiches, food, and wine. All these are in the village, along with the grocery store. No shortage of calores in our two days there.</p>

				<p><p>* “Hard Time by Sara Paretsky”:amazon. Had this book on the shelf for a while, a typical airport purchase. Didn’t expect much but was actually happy with it. A lot more depth of character than I typically find in your mass market detective novel. Worth reading more in the series. * “Stranger Things Happen by Kelly Link”:amazon. Trying to be bradbury. And occasionally hits the note. But I think I’d rather reread “the illustrated man”:amazon or “the martian chronicles”:amazon. * “The Sheltering Sky”:amazon. Ok at first I couldn’t get into this novel, I just didn’t care about these two people wandering thru northern africa. But wow, the story really engaged as the characters struggled to connect with each other and with the world, while fighting greater and greater physical hardships.

				<!-- <p><p>* “Hard Time by Sara Paretsky”:amazon. Had this book on the shelf for a while, a typical airport purchase. Didn’t expect much but was actually happy with it. A lot more depth of character than I typically find in your mass market detective novel. Worth reading more in the series. * “Stranger Things Happen by Kelly Link”:amazon. Trying to be bradbury. And occasionally hits the note. But I think I’d rather reread “the illustrated man”:amazon or “the martian chronicles”:amazon. * “The Sheltering Sky”:amazon.

				<p><p>After my forays this winter to <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001776.html">Duluth</a> and <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001832.html">el paso</a>, I wasn’t expecting much from the next stop in my tour of minor american cities – prescott, arizona.</p>

<p>Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Prescott is a gem. High desert country – great climate. Pleasantly treelined streets. Historical downtown which has largely been maintained. A little college influence. Lots of restaurants and arts for a small city. Biking, hiking trails abound. Great launch point for sidetrips to Sedona or Flagstaff.</p>

<p>I’d not be sad to go back.</p>

			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK as anyone who has mucked around with fog machines knows, it is hard to get the fog to lie low. You can buy fog chillers or build your own, plans abound on the web.</p>

<p>But here is <a href="http://www.methodzofmadness.com/php/smf/index.php?topic=1391.new#new">a simple solution on the MOM forums</a> – basically run your fog machine output through a pile of mulch. Apparently the temperature and moistness of the mulch cool the fog enough to keep it down. Good idea, I will try this year.</p>
