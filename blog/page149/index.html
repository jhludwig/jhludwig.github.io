Characters sometimes a little thin – or maybe so transhuman as to be unsympathetic. Deftly handled resolution – didn’t try to answer every question.

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>OK in the last four days Comcast has cut my IP address lease times down to 2 hours. At at the end of that two hours there are often 3-5 minutes when I cannot get a valid lease at all.</p>

<p>Spoke with comcast and got the run around – “reboot everything”, “remove your router”, “unplug your toaster”, “wear a little foil hat like joaquin phoenix did in Signs”. Finally they told me it is all the router’s fault (it’s been working fine for 1 year) and that I need to sign up for their home networking option.</p>

<p>So I am on hold to find out what that is. Anyone have any relevant advice?</p>

<p>UPDATE: spoke with a much better support person at Comcast. Issue has been escalated. I continue to see lease times &lt; 2 hours. And at every renewal, i am getting widely varying IP addresses (not so unusual) AND varying subnet masks – anything from 255.255.255.0 up to 255.255.255.250. that seems odd to me. I’ve switched routers to no avail, also tried routerless.</p>

				<p><p>I got a couple questions about <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001804.html">my post on LED lightbulbs</a>. While the LED bulbs are not ready for primetime, I have had good luck with <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/diy_main/pg_diy.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1268801727.1110222142@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=cceladdedellkfdcgelceffdfgidgln.0&amp;CNTTYPE=PROD_META&amp;CNTKEY=Super%20Categories/Home%20D%E9cor%20%26%20Organizing&amp;MID=9876&amp;pos=p04">these compact fluorescents from HDb</a>. They fit a standard socket and provide a very warm light, almost a little too yellow. But certainly no hint of blue.</p>

<p>I also recently ordered from http://www.lumitroncop.com and from http://www.1000bulbs.com. I ordered compact fluorescents to replace r20s and r30s (spots), we’ll see how those work.</p>

<p>I was motivated to move to incandescent alternatives because my office at home is too hot between all the PCs and devices and lights. Now that some have worked, I am motivated to move the whole house over for the energy savings. The one application that I am stuck with incandescents is for lights on dimming circuits – fluorescents don’t like variable voltage.</p>

				<p><p>I need a car for about 6 months to use up on Lopez Island. You can do long term rentals at places like <a href="http://www.budget.com/bbtm/">Budget</a> but very expensive.</p>

<p>Assuming an existing lease may be the way to go – <a href="http://www.swapalease.com/">Swapalease</a> and <a href="http://www.leasetrader.com/">Leasetrader</a> both seem to have a lot of inventory.</p>

<p>I wonder if contacting some local leasing agents directly might not be the smartest thing to do – they must have some leases in default that they need someone to pick up.</p>

				<p><p>Man these guys at <a href="http://www.cendant.com/">Cendant</a> are abusive.</p>

<p>Not for the first time, I got a $10 “check” in the mail apparently from Budget Rent A Car. In the fine print on the check it mentions that cashing will activate a membership in the National Home Protection Alliance program.</p>

<p>More fine print on the back. Wow, I also get a 2% rebate on all credit card purchases. Oh capped at $5000 of purchases, but $100 bucks is something. Oh and I get more discounts, and some kind of insurance benefit on household expenses.</p>

<p>Now the kicker. Well on in the fine print, I see it is going to cost me $39.99 a month for all this. $40 a month!!!! My gosh.</p>

<p>The entire piece of mail is designed to deceive. The true nature of the offer is buried in fine print. The casual customer of Budget will think they overpaid or something and are getting a legitimate refund.</p>

<p>I was going to write a letter to the CEO of Budget, suggesting that they might want to stop selling their customer names to Trilegiant, the organization that is sending out this abuse. But of course – Budget and Trilegiant are both subs of Cendant!</p>

<p>Bastards.</p>

Not really sure I know how to make the most of this but another nice tool to sniff out malware. * Haven’t tried <a href="http://www.replay-music.com/faq.php">Replay Music</a> yet but seems to be the ultimate tool to bypass all the lame DRM in various players * Another great list of small software utilities – <a href="http://www.pricelessware.org/thelist/index.htm">Pricelessware</a> * Thanks to <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/01/14.html#a1151">Jon Udell for the pointer to Linky</a>, a great firefox extension. * <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/logparser_22.html">Logparser 2.2</a>. Loved earlier versions, haven’t had time to play with this yet. * Via <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg2/TheDailyGrind557.html">Mike Gunderloy</a>, <a href="http://www.symbolclick.com/">XMLMarker</a> -- great little XML editor.</p>

<p>Sadly I have no great utilities to recommend to <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/backup_strategi.html">Steve</a> for home/consumer-oriented backup – I too have a ton of storage at home, I use scripts to copy precious data to backup locations every night, very kludgey but cheap.</p>
