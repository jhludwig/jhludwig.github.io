				<p><p>Our extended family of bloggers are becoming overactive, it is hard for me to keep up. Highlights:</p>

<p>* Rich is digging into MT - <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/blogs/2005/05/20/mt_categories.html">nice tip on category tags</a>, and he <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/blogs/2005/05/20/tongfamily_templates.html">graciously posts his templates</a> – nice idea, I will do this when I am finished hacking on mine too. * Rich on computers – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/2005/05/24/computer_ergonomics.html">proper ergonomics</a> (I’ve been getting a stiff neck recently, good tips), <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/05/27/sony_t350.html">and the new evdo-equipped sony laptop</a> – wifi hotspots are becoming a mess, with 4-5 available in a location of uncertain quality and safety, evdo and similar solutions could become a hit with the business crowd. * Phil with some <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/home-networking-resources.html">great thinking on search scoping</a>, <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/announcing-berry-411-version-22.html">releasing the latest version of Berry 411</a> (installed), talking about <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/myvoipweb.html">myvoipweb</a> (don’t trust caller id anymore), showing off <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/recommended-jobs-feed.html">his jobs sidebar</a> (very cool). * Kudos <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net//2005/05/22/melodeo_launches_on_rogers.html">to Melodeo for Rogers launch</a> * Martin is <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/more_meat_for_t.html">bullish on NPUs</a>. * John and Rich’s <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/05/24/taiwanese_edition.html">book out in Taiwan and Korea now</a>! Guys I’d love to hear about the economics behind this. * Jason on <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/rss_jobs_aggreg.html">RSS Jobs aggregators</a>, <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/job_blog_explos.html">job blogs</a>, <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/good_to_great_s.html">good to great staffing</a>, <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/we_just_launche.html">Jobster 1.1 launch</a>. The jobster team is reminding me that incredible focus on an exact customer segment and exact customer problems will always pay off. * <a href="http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2005/05/consumer_passio.html">Andy fishing for ideas on how to create passion amongst his customers</a>. My 2 cents Andy - learn from the Jobster guys! * Not an ignition extended family blog, but related to our business – Fred has <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=1120">a nice posting on the “pass”</a>:</p>

<p>** <em>Say no quickly to the things you know you aren’t going to do</em> ** <em>Don’t take an opportunity into diligence unless you are willing to spend enough time to truly undersand it, and if you don’t invest, make sure you are willing to spend time explaining why.</em></p>

				<p><p>This weekend’s best hike was up Squak Mountain. <a href="http://www.ci.issaquah.wa.us/page.asp?navid=526">The City of Issaquah website lists trailheads</a> – we started at Mountainside Drive. Nice steady uphill hike for 2 miles – gets the heart pumping, but not so extreme that it kills you.</p>

<p>It is a state park but for some reason the <a href="http://www.parks.wa.gov/alpha.asp">state park website</a> doesn’t list it, and I found no good maps online. But the trails are well marked and pretty well maintained.</p>

				<p><p>* “The Rings of Saturn”:amazon. Difficult to get in the mood of this one. A solitary travel through modern england – dry, depressing tourism. There are no characters in the book besides the author, despite his wandering about present day England. I couldn’t finish – I guess it reinforces that life is all about the people you live it with, not about the places or things. * “Starfish by Peter Watts”:amazon. Wow a seriously good story. Characters have real meat, deeply damaged (by life? by design? an unresolved mystery) but deeply human. Layers of story here, it really draws you in. * “Freakonomics”:amazon. A solid nonfiction read. Entertaining, crisp, not bloated. The right length. The kind of economist I’d love to be, if I could. And a nice <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog.php">blog</a> * “The Magic Mountain”:amazon. I am really struggling with this one. The characters are boring but subtly compelling. But boy a whole lot of nothing happens in the story. I may need to save this book for a quieter location and time.</p>

<p>Oh and <a href="http://listsofbests.com/news/#000057">another award winner list – the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award</a>. Some of these look interesting.</p>

				<p><p>Based on <a href="http://www.zagula.com/food_and_wine/2005/05/19/seven_stars_pepper.html">john’s reco</a>, we found our way to seven stars pepper. A little hard to find but it was tasty – the Chong Gin chicken john reco’ed was excellent. But at the end of the meal we all agreed – chinese food is just not our favorite asian cuisine, we far prefer the flavors and spices of thai food.</p>

<p>Also we ate at <a href="http://www.serafinaseattle.com/">serafina</a> for lunch one day. Great great italian, we consistently like the Melanzane alla Serafina (eggplant rolls). Parking can be painful at busy times.</p>

				<p><p>So sometimes I just don’t have time to get to a trailhead, like this AM. In the past I would have just blown off exercising in the face of a tiny hurdle like this.</p>

<p>But this morning I parked the store at the grocery in factoria (my true destination) and hoofed it up the office and apartment-encrusted hills above factoria. Not very picturesque but it got my blood flowing. And the crisp windy air felt great. Glad I did it.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Back to Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park (for the second time this week) for Today’s hike. BTW, online maps for the park can be found at the <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/gis/vmc/Recreation.htm">King County GIS Center</a>. Earlier this week we parked at the Anti-Aircraft Peak Trailhead, the Shangri-La trail from that point is a quite pretty tree-lined over-grown roadway, culminating in some huge lightly-treed bowls full of ferns and other ground cover – gorgeous. The trail leads steadily down so you’ll have a bit of a walk back to the trailhead.</p>

<p>This morning started at the Wilderness Creek Trailhead on the SE side of the park. A relative low point, the trail from here is a great cardio workout, steadily up with a lot of switchbacks. I ran out of time and didn’t quite make it to the top of Wildnerness Peak, you should be able to get from trailhead to top in an hour or hour and 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Next up: I think I’ll try the neighboring Squak Mountain trails.</p>

				<p><p>Boy Google has become pretty polluted on the topic of home networking, many of the top pages are thin bags of links, clearly just thrown together to generate google hits and revenue. Here’s my own list of home networking resources that I use.</p>

<p>* Blogs: ** <a href="http://www.practicallynetworked.com/">practically networked</a> – general home network coverage ** <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/">pvrblog</a> – PVRs ** <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/">ehomeupgrade</a> – all kinds of digital home and gagdet goodness</p>

<p>* Software Tools: ** <a href="http://www.purenetworks.com">pure networks</a> – for file sharing, printer sharing, and generally keeping track of what’s on the network (Disclosure: Ignition is an investor) ** <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">itunes</a> – for music playing and sharing. We keep all our music on a server, I wish itunes would push tags and playlists back to the server. ** <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/mobility/getstarted/remoteintro.mspx">Remote Desktop</a> – I use this all the time to manage different machines from the family room – requires XP Pro. I tried a bunch of freeware alternatives but none of them seemed particularly robust at the time. ** <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">Beyond Compare</a> – my backup strategy is to spread copies of photos and music around to 4-5 different places.</p>

<p>* Other websites: ** <a href="http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/category04">Annoyances.org</a> – some handy troubleshooting guides ** <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/">avsforum</a> – for av/hometheater stuff ** <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/">dslreports</a> – nice speed test for your broadband link among other tools ** <a href="http://bbhcentral.com/report/backissues/Report0503_1.html">Sandy and Dave’s</a> – a nice newsletter summing up industry events</p>

<p>That’s the primary list of resources. Anybody else have good ones?</p>

				<p><p>Another hiking area close to home is <a href="http://www.ci.bellevue.wa.us/page.asp?view=2106">the Mercer Slough</a>. Not that much altitude variation but a really beautiful wetlands area – ferns, dense trees and brush, waterways, birds of all sorts.
