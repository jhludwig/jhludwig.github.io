				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">11 May 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Martin has been an enthusiastic blogger about alternative energy <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/going_biodiesel.html">-- his biodiesel commuter car</a>, a <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/iogen_close_to.html">new cellulose ethanol plant</a>, <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/new_biodiesel_p.html">new biodiesel pumps in seattle</a>. I admire his putting his investment and consumer dollars on the line.</p>

<p>It’s made me intrigued about power. I’ve started at <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/recs/recs2001/publicuse2001.html">the DOE site on power use by consumers</a>. I learned that, as of 2001:</p>

<p>* We’re using about 95 Million BTU per household per year. About 4 3/4s short tons of coal for each of our homes if I did the math right. * Most of our use in the home is for heating (our surroundings and our water) and cooling. * The big story from 1993 to 2001 is declining power usage for heating, offset in part by greater cooling usage. I assume our heating systems are getting more efficient though there could be other reasons. * Appliances and lighting are about a quarter of our use.</p>

<p>I am very curious about the next 10 years of use:</p>

<p>* What will hybrid cars do to our consumption in the home? * How will the entry of low power lighting into the home (compact fluorescent, LED) affect usage? * How will the explosion of digital technology in the home affect our level of use – and our demand for uninterruptible power? * How will all this affect our HVAC needs? * What about home power generation? Good article in Wired about <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/1,2167,67465,00.html">home power generation</a>. and look at this <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000507043014/">cool sharp system</a> for managing your home power generation and grid connection</p>

<p>As a bleeding edge user, I am starting to see strains on the power (and HVAC) systems in my home:</p>

<p>* A sea of wallwarts generating DC power and heat in various places in the house. * Significant heat disposal issues in my office and at media centers. I’ve had to do crazy special things to deal with these problems – a special air conditioner for the office, a venting system and fan for the media center. The existing HVAC system, designed for whole house human comfort, is not designed to deal with waste heat from appliances. * Low end battery backups in a couple places in the home to insure continued operation of phones, pcs, etc.</p>

<p>No conclusions here today, just wondering. I’d love to talk to some home builders and understand what they view as state of the art hvac/power systems in the home.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">05 May 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>In the last couple weeks I’ve been to Lopez, Vashon, and I’m heading to Port Angeles this weekend, with more trips to Lopez in the offing.</p>

<p>There are instructions up at <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/">the WSDOT site</a> about how to get a ferry schedule on your PDA – sign up for avantgo, download avantgo client, configure a custom channel, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>At least for a fairly recent blackberry, this is all unnecessary. Just point your blackberry browser at the <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/pda/">pda schedule link</a> and you will be set.</p>

<p>Of course if you are on Shaw Island or someplace remote with no GPRS or whatever access, well, sorry.</p>

<p>And if you are new to the area – well there is nothing better than a ferry ride on a nice day.</p>

<p>Other handy Northwest links of recent note:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://seattle.wifimug.org">Wifi finder</a> (thanks <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/dglasser/Blog/cns!1p-emyT81hoTzPBWYQDUufJg!297.entry">Danny</a>) * Shop for inflatables at <a href="http://www.ballardinflatables.com/default.asp">Ballard Inflatables</a> or <a href="http://www.westcoastfrogs.com/">West Coast Frogs</a>. While in Ballard I hear that <a href="http://www.inballard.com/Webroot/souvenir.shtml">Souvenir</a> is a cool place to stop – this whole inballard site seems cool. * A slightly stale article on <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/03/emp_rip.html">the decline of the EMP</a>. Visit soon before it is gone. Personally I found the place to be boring – I should be able to hear a lot more music at a music museum, not just read about it.</p>

				<h2 class="blog-post__title"><a href="/blog/what-i-want-from-longhorn">What I Want From Longhorn</a></h2>
				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">01 May 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>So last week seemed like a yawner for the windows business. Msft’s quarterly results showed a mature business. People at winhec were bored with longhorn – at best.</p>

<p>It got me to thinking about what I really want in the next version of windows. A lot of the discussion around longhorn concerns what I would classify as middleware – tagging, searching, graphical layout, media, etc. I can get a lot of this today without buying a whole new OS – and in fact would prefer to get this unbundled from my OS, and would prefer to get my OS unbundled from middleware.</p>

<p>What I really want an OS to do is get the most out of my hardware, and more to the point, make my hardware work. Here are some things I want</p>

<p>* Smart hard disk failure prediction. All the hard disks are instrumented, most of the utilities suck, but Microsoft should have the data to do a great job of failure prediction, especially if they pool real experience across all Windows users. * Video card stability. I play games, I have to download unapproved video drivers all the time, I wish the latest cards had better driver support. * Correctly working Usb attached drives. So often my XP machine decides it can’t find the drives. Why? I have no idea. But it happens on all my machines and I’ve heard it from other people too. * Bios patching. I’ll leave it for another day why we still have to deal with BIOSes at all, but given we do – why can’t windows find and apply all the patches for me? * Overclocking support. Give me a nice UI to deal with processor, ram, videocard clocking, and save me from doing wrong things. * Real working hibernation and suspend. I don’t use these features ever because so many devices don’t respond correctly to these state changes. * Sata support. It is terrible that using a sata drive requires me to insert a floppy at windows install time – who the heck has floppy drives any more??? * Software raid – please let me bond together heterogeneous drives, stripe across them, replicate across them, etc. * Power usage monitoring and budgeting. As my buddy rich tong has pointed out, a ton of system failures are due to insufficient power supplies. * Wireless USB. Please support asap! * Better printer and camera drivers. I hate all the shovelware that the printer and camera guys provide. Just please include the simplest possible drivers to print pages and to suck files off the camera. Phone drivers too so I can sync with ANY phone, not just msft’s smartphones – and don’t tell me to use ActiveSync, that thing is a confusing and confused piece of software. * Multicore support. Do something interesting with this. Don’t let the additional core just get sucked into the miasma of windows startup tasks, etc.</p>

<p>My point is – the OS should make my hardware work great and work flawlessly, that should be the point of an OS release. I don’t want delivery of these features slowed down by middleware integration, and I don’t want middleware delivery slowed down by inclusion of all these hardware features.</p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I previously posted that I tried <a href="http://www.litefeeds.com">litefeeds</a> and it didn’t work. <a href="http://www.litefeeds.com/blojsom/blog/john/">One of their developers</a> read my blog and contacted me for details, and so I retried.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that litefeeds now works fine, and there was never really a problem except for a rookie mistake by me.</p>

<p>I read my subs using <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">newsgator</a>, and I regularly export the OPML file from newsgator to <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com">blogrolling.com</a> for my blog’s sidebar. Blogrolling.com will export my blogroll in opml as well, and I grabbed that for importation into litefeeds, blithely thinking “hey all opml files are the same”. WRONG. The newsgator exported file contains RSS feed urls. When imported into blogrolling, blogrolling determines the base blog url and just saves that. And so the exported opml file from blogrolling is not rss feed urls, but blog urls.</p>

<p>So litefeeds works fine now. And now that I can play with it I have some more constructive comments. It does install nicely and has a small memory footprint. But it is too hard to see content. First, when I have a feed or item listed, the space bar or return key should perform the default action – open the feed and show me the posts, open the post and show me the content.</p>

<p>Second, I don’t want just the entry excerpt provided by the feed, I want to push thru and read the whole post – litefeeds should integrate with the blackberry browser and let me read the posts.</p>

<p>So…happy to report that litefeeds works, and appreciate the support from the team. Hoping that they will add some more features so that it is even easier to read content.</p>

Promised to be a nice RSS reader for the blackberry, and the blackberry client looked OK and installed easily. But lots of bugs on the server side handling my imported OPML so I gave up. * <a href="http://www.olivelink.com">Olivelink</a>. Promised to be a way to easily share video with friends and family but like most of these apps, couldn’t handle firewall/nat traversal without a bunch of tweaking, so i gave up.</p>

<p>Meaning to Try:</p>

<p>* Alternatives to newsgator – <a href="http://www.intravnews.com">intravnews</a> and <a href="http://www.yousoftware.com">You Subscribe</a>. OK I love newsgator and it has been a rock for me, but worth looking around as I haven’ gotten any new features from newsgator in a while. * <a href="http://www.orb.com">orb</a>. Another videosharing app. <a href="http://www.blogmatrix.com">Blogmatrix</a> might be worth trying too. * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=315557">Flexwiki upgrade</a>. I use flexwiki for some personal projects and generally like it. Looks like a worthy upgrade.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">26 April 2005</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>For fun, went to the WinHEC blogger lunch today. Hosted by Joe Peterson, a great guy I worked with years ago. Well attended, probably thanks to the nice lunch at <a href="http://www.tulio.com/">Tulio</a>.</p>

<p>Joe opened with a message about community – how important the blogger and developer community was to Microsoft and how important events like this are. Talked about the recent 64bit Windows release. And for longhorn, mentioned a beta in early summer, beta2 in fall, and release to manufacturing next summer.</p>

<p>Questions from the bloggers present for Joe and team:</p>

<p>* Tagging in longhorn. How does this work without WinFS? Where are tags stored (in the files as file formats permit)? What about tag collisions (bummer. some talk about per-user tags but sounded like it won’t be in the product)? Personally I don’t get the excitement about tags in the audience or among the blog community, I don’t think users really want to use tags – they just want free text search. * Sidebar? cut for now. * Working to improve multimonitor support by pulling more out of display-specific drivers and into general level. display driver stability a big goal * By default, users will operate in “protected admin” and “standard user” rights levels – prompts for installs and admin ops. * Longhorn target – work on 256m system, prob will reco 512. 1gig proc. Will work with all old drivers. * Skinnable ui? working to add more skinnable features. * Dev team is purchasing only 64bit machines going forward. Daily builds of both, will simship both, you’ll be able to choose. For my money – if the dev team is running 64bit machines, then that is what I want to run, I know they will make that work well. * Will virtualpc ship in longhorn? Looking at.</p>

<p>All in all a great lunch. Thanks Joe et al.</p>
