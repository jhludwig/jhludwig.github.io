Conversely, it provides the potential for a higher margin if it is indeed successful.” * <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/004216.html?wbfrom=rss">Ballmer on being first</a> – “When Ballmer gets talking about how Microsoft must be first with technology innovations ? which, so far in Microsoft’s history, has not often happened…” – amazing how critics continue to miss the obvious areas where Microsoft was first. The refactoring of the PC industry from vertical all-in-one boxes to today’s horizontal build-your-own didn’t just happen by accident, there is a ton of software innovation that occurred to support and motivate that shift. * Mini-Microsoft pulls no punches – <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/02/something-is-rotten-in-town-of-redmond.html">“Is something rotten in Redmond?

    <p>Man these guys at <a href="http://www.cendant.com/">Cendant</a> are abusive.</p>

<p>Not for the first time, I got a $10 “check” in the mail apparently from Budget Rent A Car. In the fine print on the check it mentions that cashing will activate a membership in the National Home Protection Alliance program.</p>

<p>More fine print on the back. Wow, I also get a 2% rebate on all credit card purchases. Oh capped at $5000 of purchases, but $100 bucks is something. Oh and I get more discounts, and some kind of insurance benefit on household expenses.</p>

<p>Now the kicker. Well on in the fine print, I see it is going to cost me $39.99 a month for all this. $40 a month!!!! My gosh.</p>

<p>The entire piece of mail is designed to deceive. The true nature of the offer is buried in fine print. The casual customer of Budget will think they overpaid or something and are getting a legitimate refund.</p>

<p>I was going to write a letter to the CEO of Budget, suggesting that they might want to stop selling their customer names to Trilegiant, the organization that is sending out this abuse. But of course – Budget and Trilegiant are both subs of Cendant!</p>

<p>Bastards.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/02/17/recent-books-3.html">Recent Books</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>OK while I was sick I found it hard to even read, but a few books did make it through:</p>

<p>* “Samaritan”:amazon by Richard Price. A great story of a guy whose need to help people is his undoing. A great cautionary tale – when you are trying to help people, don’t do it for your own gratification reasons, as this will often cause you to do the wrong things. Really put yourself in their shoes and help them in a way that is about them, not about you. * “The Year’s Best Science Fiction, 18th Annual Collection”:amazon, editted by Gardner Dozois. Always a great collection – a great way to get names of authors and books that you should read, rather than what the bookstore is promoting. * “Wolves Eat Dogs”:amazon by Martin Cruz Smith. I have no idea what moscow and the ukraine are like … But gosh, smith is good at transporting you, with very few words. Story drug a little long but great imagery. * “The Laughing Sutra”:amazon by Mark Salzman. Reco’d by a very smart friend. Interesting story, intertwining of myth and today. But compare/contrast with Martin Cruz Smith title – I never felt transported to China in this book, the imagery and dialog just didn’t do its job, this story could have been set anywhere.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/02/17/mac-mini-as-htpc.html">mac mini as htpc</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>So after a week of playing with my new mac mini as my hometheater pc, i am mostly happy. I’ve configured it to grab downloaded AVIs (via bittorrent) off my windows file server – the mac connected pretty easily to windows, in some ways it is easier than connecting two xp machines. <a href="http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/avidivx.html">Per this guide</a>, i installed vlc to play the downloaded avis – works great. (Wow I had forgotten how easy it is to install apps on the mac).</p>

<p>Still looking for two things to complete the experience:</p>

<p>* a great 10 foot ui for playing avis and dvds. Myth is overkill, i don’t want all the pvr functionality, i just want the 10 foot UI. * a wireless remote. I have the bluetooth kb and mouse but I want a remote. Maybe this <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/airclick/index.php">griffin airclick</a> tho it doesn’t seem to be shipping yet?</p>

<p>So just a few more pieces and it will be perfect. And for once the mac is the price leader – <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BuildingYourOwnWindowsMediaCenterEdition2005HomeTheaterPCSystem.aspx">compare with windows-based systems that people are building</a>. And of course the mac is the style leader – compare with <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/610/stealth_littlepc_lpc-401fs">this ugly brute</a>.</p>

    <p>I’m way behind and so missed a lot of good stuff. But a few things I noticed on Ignition blogs (or blog posts about Ignition or its portfolio)…</p>

<p>* Rich is tracking the <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/02/14/vonage_running_bus_and_billboard_ads.html">emerging voip wars</a>, and the most recent <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net/consumer/2005/02/14/skype_is_coming_out_on_mobile.html">skype device announcement</a> – wow, isn’t this device the kind of thing that HP should have made back in the “HP Way” days? * The Jobster team has gone live with <a href="http://www.jobster.blogs.com">a company blog</a>. * A post I’ve been hanging onto for a while, Martin points to a blog all about <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2004/12/the_best_2004_l.html">the best of 2004</a> and wonders how to make a business out of. Does seem like a natural starting point for a nice little ecommerce business. * Martin also continues <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/01/hanging_with_th.html">his biodiesel adventure</a>… * One of the folks at Ignition has some Ethiopian family members – here is a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExplainingTheEthiopicNumberingSystemAndATinyLessonOnAmharic.aspx">cool post on the Ethopic number system</a>, I had no idea. * Some <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000637031287/">criticism of Melodeo’s service</a> – not sure I totally agree with, I think the Melodeo offering is a reasonable tradeoff of convenience and fairness, but I understand the point. * Rich’s pc hardware investigations – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/02/08/iscsi_for_home.html">iscsi at home</a> and <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/01/05/does_sli_matter.html">Does SLI matter (yes!)</a>. Crap, not only do I not have a water-cooled PC, now I also don’t have iSCSI or an SLI config. I am a loser. * Martin likes <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/01/my_new_favorite_1.html">these web radio stations.</a> I’ve never really understood the attraction, I am an ipod and in-car music listener. But I should try. * Nice press for <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/01/freeware_of_the_3.html">network magic</a> (disclosure – I’m on the board). * Fred <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=738">points to Martin’s posts</a> on tag systems. I am not a believer in tag systems. I think humans just want to do free text searches – let the computers figure out how to parse and tag content. But certainly a lot of heat around tags right now.</p>

    <p>My <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000788.html">Chevy Avalanche</a> has a blind spot in which you can hide Mount Rainer, it is just huge. Backing up has always terrified me as I could easily be running over a child, a horse, a small car, and I’d never know it.</p>

<p>The good folks at <a href="http://www.benchmarkmotoring.com/">Benchmark Motoring</a> helped me out – they installed a rearview camera with fisheye lens, just mounted above the trailer hitch. When I shift into reverse, it takes over the nav screen and displays a rear facing video feed.</p>

<p>I didn’t think it would help that much…but I am hooked. I can’t imagine ever getting any car without this again. Not only is it a great safety feature, but your parallel parking becomes brilliant with this. So much better than a rear view mirror. Highly recommended.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/02/10/latest-adventures-with-my-sharp-aquos.html">Latest adventures with my sharp aquos</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Finally feeling good enough to start tinkering again, and to blog about it.</p>

<p>I’m continuing my odyssey to attach every piece of technology I can to my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001775.html">sharp aquous beast of a tv.</a> My Mac Mini arrived last week and I have it hooked up now to the DVI port. Looks great. The gotchas: Apple saves money by shipping the mini with no cables, so you have to go buy a DVI cable ($70 at least) and a stereo mini-jack cable (Aside – why does Apple even bother putting a speaker in the mac mini???). 2nd gotcha – the sharp defaults to an analog video signal from the pc, and you have to go wade thru the menus to force it to look for a digital signal – seems like this could be auto-detected. The mini makes a great hometheater pc – small, quiet, a fine dvd player. And I have bittorrent running on it to fill up the hard disk with tv content.</p>

<p>For additional fun I plugged a <a href="http://www.kingston.com/products/pccard.asp">kingston pcmcia hard drive</a> into the pcmcia port on aquous. What a bizarre feature. I can play slide shows and videos off the pccard. Oh and I can take snapshots and video captures of the current signal, as long as it is from a crappy analog input – analog coax, analog s-video. the tv won’t capture the signal from a digital input or from the component inputs, probably to make the mpaa et al happy. So basically it is a really funky and limited DVR. Just goes to show again how much trouble Tivo is in – it is trivial to slam DVR software into any box now, and storage is cheap.</p>

<p>I still have to fill up the hdmi and 1394 inputs…</p>

    <p>Been quiet for a while, had a killer bronchitis/flu thing. Lost a week plus to fighting this thing. Don’t get it. Probably worsened by the fact that, 15 years ago, I inhaled an aspirin tablet and had to endure 4 bronchoscopies, a hospital stay, and numerous other indignities, and now have a permananently scarred area in my upper lungs. Ask me for the full story sometime, it has its hilarious moments.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/01/27/the-clash-of-the-tv-titans.html">The clash of the TV Titans</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* First, read yesterday’s (1/27/05) front page WSJ article on the struggle between comcast and the tv networks/producers to deliver on-demand versions of popular programs. Comcast wants to screw the networks/producers, the content owners want to protect their revenue streams, and so users are left with nothing – or more exactly, users are pushed towards unfettered version of shows that leak out thru bittorrent or other means * The networks are in an untenable position – there is just no way to keep their content contained – even if they have the fanciest drm in the world, at some point the tv signal gets rendered onto an rgb/composite/s-video feed so you can see it – take look at <a href="http://WWW.RGB.COM">rgb.com</a>, you can pick up a box today that can capture 1600x1200, 25 frames per second, off a composite or rbg feed. I.E. there is no way to keep good digital copies from surfacing on the web. * Meanwhile, Tivo is under increasing pressure – and <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/01/early_adopters_.html">it looks like consumers will be satisfied with DVRs from their tv provider</a>, rather than buy a Tivo. Too bad because the Tivo experience is way superior to other DVRs – but the egos at Tivo and at the cable/satellite companies are destroying the Tivo business. * And now Apple is crowding into the picture with the stylish Mac mini – <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/cringely_on_the.html">pointer to Cringely</a>, Steve Makofsky on <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/the_mini_media_.html">why people like the mini (and wondering why they don’t like the PC in he same way)</a>, <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9519">reviews of the Mac Mini</a>. But there is no way to get a cable or satellite digital signal into a Mac Mini today – the video providers are dead set against that happening as it creates another way for digital copies to leak onto the net – so users lose out. Can Steve Jobs pull a rabbit out of his hat and solve this? * And of course Microsoft continues to grind away with the Media Center PC. And I think all these front end boxes need a great back end media store in the home – <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/566/axentra_net-box_home">something like this maybe?</a></p>

<p>Where will we all end up? Rich has some good thoughts about the <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/01/26/future_of_home_theater.html">refactoring of the TV experience</a> – and <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/01/25/future_of_video.html">some criticisms of everyone trying to create EPGs</a>. In the short term, Steve Makofsky points out that <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/are_codecs_the_.html">we are headed for greater complexity and confusion as we have to learn about codecs and other software components.</a></p>

<p>Who is going to be the champion of the user, the friend of the user?</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/01/26/comcast-cablecard-install.html">Comcast Cablecard Install</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Today’s adventure – getting a cablecard from comcast. As anyone knows, their website is quite silent on how to order a cablecard. If you call them and ask for it, they will provide it finally with some arm twisting.</p>

<p>Two techs showed up today. The physical install in <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001775.html">my sharp aquos</a> was quite straightforward. The setup after that was confusing and we still don’t have it right.</p>

<p>First of all, the sharp manual is hilariously bad. I’m not sure anyone ever tried these instructions on how to install a cablecard. You have to make sure you are on tv input, you have to switch the input type over to cable, and then you have to make sure you hit the “digital” button on the remote. Several of this steps are left out in the manual. But I don’t blame the manual writers completely – the menu structure on the tv itself is hopelessly modal. If you happen to have the current input set to a component or hdmi or dvi input, you will never find the right menu items. But we finally figured it out.</p>

<p>The cablecard was recognized, we had to call a bunch of digits into comcast. In their network they authorize this card, and then I guess credentials are downloaded to the card which tell it what tv channels I’m allowed to see. This takes a little while, 10-15 minutes. Then digital channels start showing up.</p>

<p>Second key tip – the sharp aquous has separate coax inputs for digital or analog. You want to split your cable using a 1ghz splitter and feed the input to both. Otherwise you will only get the digital channels – which in our market, for instance, means you could never watch CBS.</p>

<p>Some things still aren’t working – I can’t see ESPN-HD for instance. Another service call in the offing.</p>

<p>In a future post I’ll expand on my feelings – but man, tv setup and video delivery to the home is just getting more complicated, not less – there are huge opportunities here to do better.</p>

  <h1><a href="/blog/2005/01/25/blog-business-summit.html">Blog Business Summit</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Attended part of the first day of this. Like many conferences, the audience was very bimodal – a minority of very knowledgeable industry people, and a majority of information seekers who are very new to blogs. Sometimes this made the presentations nonsensical – for instance a long discussion about trackback which the knowledgeable people already understood, but which confused the hell out of anyone else.</p>

<p>A lot of interest in how much money you can really make from a blog. How does google adsense work, how can you optimize for it, what can you really gross from adsense, what other kinds of sponsorship/affiliate dollars are available, etc etc etc. People are looking hard for the business model here. Honestly there was not much to chew on tho – the adsense license prevents people from talking in detail about their experiences. Personally I have to wonder about the viability of this cycle – fill a page with content to optimize your google rank, and then make money off of google ads placed on your page – Google sources you the traffic, and then pays you for the traffic. Kind of odd, isn’t Google someday going to figure out how to squeeze the guy in the middle?</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/01/24/cloning-your-mac-address.html">Cloning your MAC address</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>To take full advantage of the <a href="http://www.purenetworks.com">Network Magic</a> beta release (i’m on the board), I decided to upgrade my router/firewall from a sonicwall box I’ve had for 3-4 years to a Linksys gigabit ethernet router (i’ll be switching all my nics to gigabit nics as well – $29 for the cheapest GBE nics at fry’s).</p>

<p>The thing you must must must do – note the mac address of your old router first, because comcast ties your service to a specific mac address. I failed to do this and spent 10 minutes trying to figure out why my net wasn’t working and then noticed that my new linksys box was unable to acquire an address via dhcp. thankfully the linksys box lets you set its mac address to whatever you want, once i made this change, things were happy.</p>

<p>How regular humans will ever figure this out is beyond me. I guess they will call comcast. Why doesn’t comcast make this easy for their customers?</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/01/20/fbi-computer-systems.html">FBI computer systems</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>When I first read last week about the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=fbi+computer+overhaul&amp;btnG=Search+News">problems with the FBI computer system overhaul</a>, I was pissed at our government. $170M wasted, now another $2M to consultants to figure out why. What waste – and in an important system.</p>

<p>On further reflection, this is such an immature reaction on my part. It is the easy reaction. Today, on inauguration day, I am reminded of JFK’s words – “Ask not what your country can do for you; Ask what you can do for your country.”</p>

<p>Our industry should be reaching out to help the FBI. We can’t expect the FBI to be expert at IT, or to be able to necessarily hire or evaluate the best IT staff or consultants. It is not the FBI’s core competency. The FBI needs to solve a really big database problem – I bet there are people at MSFT, Oracle, Google who know something about these problems and could help.</p>

<p>I’m not dying to help the FBI build some huge tracking database for every citizen – but if they have the legal mandate to build something, and are going to build it, I certainly feel like we should help them spend our tax dollars wisely and get a system that does something useful.</p>

<p>Anyway – just a reminder to myself – it is not the government’s job to solve all our problems – it is our responsibility to pitch in and help solve the issues in our society that need solutions or that we are uniquely equipped to help solve.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/01/18/recent-books-2.html">Recent Books</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* “The Fermata”:amazon by Nicholson Baker. Reardon recommended this book to me, and I am worried for his soul. Very artfully crafted, very engaging, a nice moral redemption of sorts for the main character. And some interesting early discussion on moral relativity that isn’t ever really fully explored. But…all wrapped up in a story that is so smutty and demeaning that it sinks the book. Maybe that is just my midwestern upbringing. All I know is that I’m embarrassed to have the book on my shelves. I’m not sad I read it, but I won’t pick up another book by Baker. * “A Coffin for Dmitrios”:amazon by Eric Ambler. What a fine fine tale. My first ambler, a great story of crime and human nature. I find it far more approachable than le carre, and far deeper than the popular crime and suspense novels of today. * “Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation, Second Edition”:amazon by Briggs et al. A fine reference. A little dated re browser details. Nothing probably to separate this from any other CSS reference, I just needed something reasonable.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2005/01/17/impressions-of-duluth.html">Impressions of Duluth</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Landed in Duluth at 9pm Saturday. Temperature on the ground: -20 degrees F. Airport has one ticket counter, a handful of gates, and a luggage carousel the size of a small bedroom.</p>

<p>Hey, everyone here sounds like Frances McDormand in <strong><em>Fargo</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Checked in to the brand new <a href="http://www.countryinns.com/duluthmn_north">Country Inn</a> near the airport. Very pleasant, brand new. A million kids in the hotel – hockey teams in town for a tournament. All running thru the halls in swimsuits to the indoor heated pool and slide – who knew I should bring a swimsuit to Duluth in January?</p>

<p>Watching the local NBC affiliate news was an education all by itself about northern Minnesota. The news anchor and the weatherman both looked to be about 24 – they are the backup team at the station – I guess if you are a new journalism grad, Duluth is the kind of market you can start in. The weather report was all about “how many consecutive hours will the temperature stay below zero”. Record is 160+ as I recall. We’re at 60+ now, the weatherman doesn’t think we’ll break the record.</p>

<p>Sports report – Div III college hockey, Div II college hockey, Div I college hockey, high school hockey, minor league hockey. Oh yeah at the end he mentioned the NFL playoff results.</p>

<p>Down to 24 below overnight. The building popped and cracked all night long – a constant battle between freezing weather and our room heater. And not a gentle popping and cracking – more like the last 30 seconds of a bag of microwave popcorn, all night long.</p>

    <p>Just got one of <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php?masterid=3499797&amp;search=Sharp+lc-37gd4u">these</a>, in the course of a remodel. What a beast!</p>

<p>One astounding part of this beast is the i/o ports available.</p>

<p>Input: analog coax a, analog coax b, hdmi, dvi + stereo audio, component input 1 + stereo audio, component input 2 + stereo audio, s-video + stereo audio, center channel audio input, 2 I.Link (1394) terminals, digital coax in, a cablecard slot, and a regular pcmcia slot for content on pcmcia storage cards (or any format card or drive with a pcmcia adapter). Oh and an rs-232 control port, and power.</p>

<p>Output: s-video+stereo audio monitor, digital audio, analog coax, stereo speaker terminals, headphone jack, a dc output jack for unspecified future expansion.</p>

<p>I admit I have a perverse desire to hook something to every input and output just to see if the tv melts. The power consumption from a fully provisioned system must be immense.</p>

<p>More realistically I am going to try to get a cablecard out of comcast. I am going to see just what the pcmcia port can handle. And the dvi port is just screaming for a mac mini.</p>
