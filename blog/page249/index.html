				<p><p><strong>Blosxom progress</strong>. OK I have now also fixed the scripts to deal with the differences between Win2k/IIS and Unix/Apache handling of path elements after the blosxom.cgi reference in the URL. I can find no way to make Win2k/IIS treat this as a path_info argument to a perl script, so i have changed the script to make “?topic=foo” work as the argument to get a specific content blog – e.g. <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/halloween?topic=props">www.theludwigs.com/halloween?topic=props</a>. Which meant i had to patch up the links that blosxom creates for permalinks, etc. I am pretty sure archive viewing doesn’t work quite right yet tho i am not sure I care since I don’t have an archive for my halloween blog. Also haven’t looked at the RSS output yet.</p>

I am toying around with <a href="http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/">blosxom</a> for my halloween blog. i like the innate categorization in blosxom as the defining paradigm since my halloween blog is less about dated posts and more about categories of things. getting blosxom running on win2k is proving to be something of a chore. the base scripts have a lot of assumptions about file system naming and file system functionality that are just broken on iis and nt. I have fixed some of this in my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/blosxom.cgi">trial blog</a> – notably i have changed the blosxom scripts to eliminate their expectation of symbolic links (tho i would like to go back and add in windows shortcut functionality as a replacement). The permalinks are busted tho, as there are some differences in cgi handling in iis vs apache. So still tuning – if anyone has already solved the problem of blosxom on nt, please send me a note!</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">10 October 2002</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>Good Trial</strong>. I’ve been trialing the <a href="http://www.good.com/">Good</a> software for the Blackberry 957. The RIM software has always been a little crufty – the todo list for instance is much worse than the Palm’s. So very interested in alternatives.</p>

<p>The pros of the Good software: Full over-the-air sync of all Outlook items (mail, contacts, calendar, todo, notes) is great. I love that. I use notes and todo list a lot, this is a huge boon to me. The homepage calendar view is nice, much more useful than calendar popup reminders. In-band mail addressing is nice – much more intuitive than popping out to the address book browser. Attachment viewing is a nice feature tho not as useful as I thought it would be. It still takes a lot of time to download attachments, and tables don’t come across well as they get unwound to fit on the small screen.</p>

<p>Cons: Performance is slower than the RIM software. I have a large address book (~2000 entries) and a fairly large calendar file. Searching the address book is slower than it was with the RIM software, paging thru the calendar is slower. The RIM software could keep up with my typing, the Good software cannot at times.</p>

<p>Battery life is a big concern. I used up 30% in one day running the Good software – I assume because of the increased radio traffic from all the ota syncing. With the RIM software I could go for a week between cradles without even thinking about it, and 2 weeks at least if I engaged in some modest power management (turn off the device at night). With Good I will have to think a lot more about power management.</p>

<p>The Calendar app is clearly not done. No week view. The month view doesn’t indicate if you have appointments on days, and hence is not useful. No creation of recurring appointments on the device. Agenda view is really really slow. The “jump” dialog is busted – the cursor is placed on the “Go” button by default, not on the date fields. And when you scroll the month field past year end, the year is not auto-incremented.</p>

<p>Addressing doesn’t search on first names. It is great that I can directly edit the “to” field and have it autocomplete names, but i am used to typing in first names and this doesn’t work. You have to type in last names – ugh.</p>

<p>Net/net, based on 3 days experience – I am still sticking with the Good software for now. Over the air sync is nice. But I can’t really enthusiastically recommend it yet. They need to improve performance, the calendar app, addressing, and battery life (I hope they can do over-the-air software upgrades!). Maybe the Good device is better on these fronts.</p>

				<p><p><strong>Storm Sewer Sounds</strong>. Brilliant – from the MoM Group –</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I always wanted to put sound coming out of my storm drain, so this year I did! I used a 1X2 piece of wood and duct taped my two self powered speakers on it, then I taped the CD player in between the speakers. I put two eye hooks on the ends of the wood and used wire to hang pictures on each eye hook. then I twisted it in the middle to make a loop so I could hook it to a chain to lower it down the drain. I tested it last night and it was awesome! It freaked people out as they walked by! I was talking to a neighbor who was walking her dog and she said she was wondering were the sound was coming from. she said she heard it from the next street! I took a walk down the block and sure enough the sound was coming from all the gutters! HA I found a way to haunt the whole neighborhood! The sound was traveling thru the pipes! If you have storm drains in your neighborhood this is a must try! oooo also forgot I used the whisper MP3 that was posted on the list! man did it sound cool! Imagine walking by the storm drain and hearing that!</em></p>

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p><strong>Pinewood Derby</strong>. Helping my son build a boat for science class, I started reminiscing about a similar project from my youth. My Pinewood Derby entry – I slaved over it, with only help from my dad on the powertools. My car looked terrible, it was basically a box with lead weights attached, spray-painted gold. Clearly some of the other kids were way more skilled than me, or had had substantial parental help. But despite looks, I came in second that day, which was pretty exciting. I won a pen and pencil set which was way cooler than the first place prize, a canteen.</p>

<p>Gosh knows why I remember this day with such clarity. Clearly it had a big impression on me. In some way I was really proud of the achievement. And there is something primal about working with your dad on a project like this. I hope my son has the same memories. Obviously a lot of people care a lot about the Pinewood Derby – a lot of info up on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pinewood+derby">Google</a> about.</p>

				<!-- <p><p><strong>Pinewood Derby</strong>. Helping my son build a boat for science class, I started reminiscing about a similar project from my youth.

				<p><p><strong>Halloween Lighting</strong>. Started to deploy lighting tonight. Step one – replace all the bulbs in exterior carriage lights with flicker bulbs. These bulbs can be hard to find at retail, I get mine at <a href="http://www.seattleindex.com/showcat3.asp?comp=52016">Kelsun Distributors</a> in Bellevue. Next is to place all the lightning lights. I have a variety of lights that trigger off my thunder soundtrack – a mix of small strobes, big strobes, 120v incandescent floods, and this year i added in some 12V floods as people on the MoM group say they respond more quickly (basically, lower voltage lights have faster response times). All together I have about 20-30 lights that go off with the thunder spread around the yard. All I did tonight was place the lights. This weekend I have to distribute my DMX control cable and actually start triggering them.</p>
