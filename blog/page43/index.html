    <p>* “Watchmen”:amazon by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Wow, excellent. Better as a graphic novel than it could have been as a book, the use of text and font and images to intertwine multiple stories works very well. You have to think as you read. * “Where Are The Customer’s Yachts?”:amazon by Fred Schwed Jr. Timeless classic, its crtiticism of the financial services industry and customers’ foolishness is still dead on. * “Broken Angels”:amazon By Richard K Morgan. Another Kovacs novel, this one wasn’t a home run for me. With all the morally ambiguous factions, I could never quite get Kovacs’ motivations. And his drawn out death postponed by one miracle drug after another quit working for me. The whole thing felt a little choppy and unmotivated. * “Biomechanics of the Gastrointestinal Tract”:amazon by Hans Gregersen. Interesting reference on the GI tract, treating it as a mechanical device and analyzing behaviour from that view. Useful to help you build up a complete picture.</p>

I think Michigan will have a lot of emotion and will win this * Syracuse vs. Northwestern. Northwestern. Never take Syracuse * Virginia Tech vs. East Carolina. VT * Michigan State vs. California. Hmm, MSU is the favorite darkhorse in the big10 this year. But hard to win on the west coast. * Hawaii vs. Florida. Florida * Alabama vs. Clemson. Oh damn, Clemson is a trendy pick, but I have never won picking Clemson * Missouri at Illinois. Mizzou. Illinois strugges to repeat last year’s breakthru * Washington vs. Oregon. Hmm, Oregon is confused at QB, UW is not. * August 31 Kentucky vs. Louisville. Ugh, no respect for these teams. Probably take Louisville * Sept 1 Fresno State vs. Rutgers. Take Rutgers at home * Tennessee vs. UCLA. UCLA not ready for primetime yet</p>

    <p>Office 2007 for Windows has some really cool features. I love the table formatting in XL, a totally obvious and good feature. And the fact that it is only in the Windows version and not in the Mac version has driven me batty, and has pissed me off so much, that I have finally converted all my XLs into Google Docs spreadsheets and dumped them into the cloud. Yes I lost some cool features. But I never have to install office software again, I don’t need to worry if the latest version is installed on the machine that I happen to be using today, I don’t have to worry about the fact that the last version of that spreadsheet is in my home office machine and not here at work, etc. I am immediately happier. I will miss table formatting, but not that much.</p>

    <p>A guy walks into a bar in Ann Arbor wearing a Michigan jersey. And carrying a cat that also has a Michigan jersey on with a little Wolverine helmet on his head, too.</p>

<p>The guy says to the bartender, “Can my cat and I watch the Michigan game here? My TV at home broke down and my cat and I always watch the game together”.</p>

<p>The bartender replies, “Normally, cats wouldn’t be allowed in the bar, but it’s not very busy in here right now, so you and the cat can have a seat at the end of the bar. But, if there’s any trouble with you or the cat, I’ll have to ask you to leave.”</p>

<p>The guy agrees, and he and his cat start watching the game. Pretty soon Michigan manages to kick a field goal and the excited cat jumps up on the bar, walks all the way down and gives everyone a high five.</p>

<p>The bartender says, “Hey, that’s pretty cool! What does he do for a touchdown?”</p>

<p>The guy answers, “I don’t know, I’ve only had him for 2 years.”</p>

    <p>* “An American Tragedy”:amazon by Theodore Dreiser. A compelling story of overreaching ambition, lust, and tragedy. But oh my gosh could it have used an editor – needs to be about 40% shorter.

Light and breezy, appealing leads. * “Big Russ and Me”:amazon by Tim Russert. A light autobiography, particularly poignant in light of Russert’s untimely passing. No deep messages but solid life lessons and makes you sorry that Russert is gone.</p>
