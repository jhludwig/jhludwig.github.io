  <h1><a href="/2003/05/05/cd30-network-mp3-player.html">cd30 Network MP3 Player</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I installed the <a href="http://www.cd3o.com/">cd30</a> network mp3 player today. i’ve been playing around with for an hour or so now.</p>

<p>What to like: well it is nice being able to listen to all my music at my stereo location. no more dragging cds around.</p>

<p>What not to like: the interface doesn’t work very well for a 1000+ artist collection like mine. there is no visual interface, just a remote and voice prompts. the remote permits tegic/t9 style entry of artist names and album names so you can get around ok, but there is no visual feedback at all, just voice response, so it is pretty tedious to get thru a large collection.</p>

<p>Also, I could not get the 802.11 link to work. I probably had the wrong ssid or wep settings. or actually the more i think about it, our 802.11 net is outside our firewall, while my cd30 server is inside the firewall, so i probably had firewall problems. whatever, it didn’t work.</p>

<p>Like with the hp media receiver, to get the best out of this device, i need to go author playlists explicitly for the device so that it is easy to navigate my content.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2003/05/03/fake-fire.html">Fake Fire</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>Halloween tip of the day – From the MoM yahoo group – Fire is usually created visually with cantalope colored orange (pale amber)and with bright pale yellow in random patterns. My suggestion would be to place the light fixture in a coffee can through the bottow with venting on the sides as too not get too warm and then gel the tops with colored gel. The plastic lid, after cutting out all of the center and leaving a half an inch of the lids outer egde and the grip , is great for a holding on the plastic sheet of gel. Gel is a plastic sheet, sold in 20” x 24” sheets for $4.99 It changes the color of your regular white light source to the color of the gel. A quick and easy way to set an entire mood in a theatrical space for a fraction of the cost of a couple of colored bulds.
