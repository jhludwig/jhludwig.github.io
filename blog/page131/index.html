				<p><p>Reading <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2006/02/8_things_to_cra.html">Jason’s post on 8 things to craft your career</a> and <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2006/02/16/can_you_tell_me_what_your_job_is_in_3_seconds_read_this_before_you_write_your_resume.html">john’s on “can you tell me what your job is in 3 seconds”</a> caused me to reflect back on some lessons I learned early in my career.</p>

<p>A very smart colleague at <a href="http://www.bah.com">Booz-Allen</a> gave me two simple rules to help me in guiding my career:</p>

<p>* <strong>Work on a business that is critical to the enterprise in which you work</strong>. Read the annual report of your company – does it talk about your business a lot, does it care about your business, does your business contribute a substantial profit to the enterprise? If so, the company will invest in and protect the business, and you will personally get support and challenges. If on the other hand the company doesn’t really care about your business – then you will be under-resourced, under-supported, and you may very well find your business shut down or sold some day. * <strong>You can either make things, or sell things</strong>. These are the two sources of enduring value in a business. And I am using a broad definition of “make” – i mean you have to be involved in creating the core value of the business – whether that be making products or providing a service. These are the functions that have to happen no matter what in a business. Every other function is subject to the vagaries of internal politics, bureaucracy, cost-cutting pressures, and other unpredictable forces – and thus is it hard to control your career path.</p>

<p>Following these rules always presented me with opportunities, challenges, responsibilities, and chances for career mobility. A whole separate discussion can be had about whether you want an aggressively upwardly mobile career-building job at all points in your life – you probably don’t – but if you do, these are reasonable simple guidelines.</p>

				<p><p>After <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2005/12/easing_the_netgear_sc101_out_o.html">expunging the Netgear SC101 disaster from my network</a>, I found that I had lost about 10% of my ripped CDs – notably all my Led Zep.</p>

<p>So time to rerip. After <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/movies/oggcodecs_decodes_flac.php">reviewing all of Rich’s goodness on codecs</a>, I decided it was time to go lossless. On my new <a href="http://www.widowpc.com">WidowPC rig</a>, I installed:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com">dbpoweramp</a> for ripping * the <a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com/codec-central.htm">flac codec</a> for lossless support * <a href="http://www.accuraterip.com/">accuraterip</a> to help insure correct ripping</p>

<p>So starting the process now. Will take months to complete as a background task. Glad I still have all the cds around. I rip to flac for longterm storage, and then convert to mp3 so that the ipod and other devices can deal with. Really not much more painful than ripping straight to mp3 – dbpoweramp does a pretty good job at batch conversion.</p>

				<p><p>* “The Armada by Garrett Mattingly”:amazon. Best. History. Book. Ever. Mattingly is a genius is at getting inside the heads of the main characters. What were the personal issues in their lives, the petty jealousies, the obligations, the ambition, and how did this all come together in their actions. I came out of the book feeling like I knew and admired the principal actors on all sides. The book also illustrates just how vital logistics and communications are in war – you’d have to say the spanish “lost” because of failures in these areas, not because of bravery or military tactics. Just a great book. You wonder if it could be written today – the author clearly takes some poetic license in describing the moods and feelings of characters – in the day of “a million little pieces”:amazon controversy, could a modern author do this? And yet this is what makes the book special. * “Death at la fenice by donnna leon”:amazon. Solid mystery set in venice. Not quite as good at transporting to a new country as say “Martin Cruz Smith”:amazon, and the guilty party was fairly evident early on, but solid characters with depth. First in a series. * “Seven types of ambiguity by elliot perlman”:amazon. What an intriguing swirl of characters and events. Misunderstandings, miscommunications, false assumptions, hidden feelings – they drive the story in a very unique way. A long read but compelling, I was driven to finish. * “the wave by walter mosley”:amazon. classic science fiction – character stumbles across mysterious events which, when unveiled, explain the fundamental nature of the universe or of humanity. tries to be profound but pretty thin gruel, especially after just reading seven types of ambiguity. Contrast with… * “Singularity sky by charles stross”:amazon. Reasonably good modern scifi. Fairly classic “humanity discovers strange artifact which reveals deeper nature of universe and changes everything” but handled deftly. Author doesn’t try to wrap up the entire nature of universe in one book but instead tells a natiural narrative and unveils some of the mystery. * “Home Land by Sam Lipsyte”:amazon. I half hate, half love this book. A very inventive voice, spinning metaphors and similes left and right. An interesting construct and a universal theme. But poisoned with exteme profanity, seemingly just for shock value. Would have been better if he had invested more in character development and in exploring the construct of the book, rather than reverting to profanity. * “A Feast For Crows by George R. R. Martin”:amazon. Contrast with <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2005/12/recent_books_6.html">jordan</a> -- martin is so much more engaging. Unlike your typical fantasy epic where all the heros live – they drop like flies in this series, and no one is purely good or evil. Yet martin keeps you engaged. This book was so long he had to split it in two and it shows – the book doesn’t quite hang together. But as part of the series it is fine.</p>

And yet this is what makes the book special. * “Death at la fenice by donnna leon”:amazon. Solid mystery set in venice. Not quite as good at transporting to a new country as say “Martin Cruz Smith”:amazon, and the guilty party was fairly evident early on, but solid characters with depth. First in a series. * “Seven types of ambiguity by elliot perlman”:amazon. What an intriguing swirl of characters and events. Misunderstandings, miscommunications, false assumptions, hidden feelings – they drive the story in a very unique way. A long read but compelling, I was driven to finish. * “the wave by walter mosley”:amazon. classic science fiction – character stumbles across mysterious events which, when unveiled, explain the fundamental nature of the universe or of humanity. tries to be profound but pretty thin gruel, especially after just reading seven types of ambiguity. Contrast with… * “Singularity sky by charles stross”:amazon. Reasonably good modern scifi. Fairly classic “humanity discovers strange artifact which reveals deeper nature of universe and changes everything” but handled deftly. Author doesn’t try to wrap up the entire nature of universe in one book but instead tells a natiural narrative and unveils some of the mystery. * “Home Land by Sam Lipsyte”:amazon. I half hate, half love this book. A very inventive voice, spinning metaphors and similes left and right. An interesting construct and a universal theme. But poisoned with exteme profanity, seemingly just for shock value. Would have been better if he had invested more in character development and in exploring the construct of the book, rather than reverting to profanity. * “A Feast For Crows by George R. R. Martin”:amazon. Contrast with <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2005/12/recent_books_6.html">jordan</a> -- martin is so much more engaging. Unlike your typical fantasy epic where all the heros live – they drop like flies in this series, and no one is purely good or evil. Yet martin keeps you engaged. This book was so long he had to split it in two and it shows – the book doesn’t quite hang together. But as part of the series it is fine.</p>
