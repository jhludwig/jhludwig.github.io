<p>Me too. I use half a dozen machines regularly, i use kiosk machines, I want all my docs everywhere. And I don’t need all the features of high-end office apps. Writely is fine for me, I am sure an online spreadsheet will be good enough too. And I am so tired of installing software on machines.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.paycycle.com/">Paycycle</a> gets a good review in <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1962506,00.asp">PCMag</a> and is paying to be at the top of google listings</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.surepayroll.com/">Surepayroll</a> gets a decent review as well but seems to cost a lot more.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sbs.adp.com/?source=PPC-GO">ADP</a> has a small business offer but I suspect overkill. Ditto <a href="http://www.peachtree.com/gateway/pps/integration.cfm?gcid=S17597x001-smb_integ&amp;keyword=small%20business%20payroll">Peachtree</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.buyerzone.com/personnel/payroll/qz_questions_265.jhtml">Buyerzone</a> seems to have a lead gen system that will generate quite a few quotes from outsourcing services. Hesitate to try, I don’t want a blizzard of annoying email. And there is <a href="http://www.supplier-match.com/content_index.jsp?c=Payroll&amp;su=service%20providers&amp;id=1083957938281003027&amp;partner=personnel/payroll/qz_questions_265.jhtml">supplier-match</a>, they are an affiliate of buyerzone, so I guess I pay two fees effectively to get a referal? crazy.</li>
  <li>I am sure the <a href="http://www.payroll.com/">quickbooks solution</a> is adequate but I don’t really want to install software.</li>
  <li>I am not sure how <a href="http://www.10dollarpayroll.com/">10dollarpayroll</a> differs from paycycle but anyone who uses the blink tag (or the moral equivalent) in 2006 is off my list.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.payrollpayroll.com/index-ppc.html">Payrollpayroll</a> – I guess they really really know know their their payroll payroll stuff stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am sure my accountant can recommend some local service providers too. Has anyone used paycycle?</p>

Some great ideas but some massively dull narrative, and characters I just didn’t care about. Yawn. After this I needed to raise my sights a little. * “The Bridge of San Luis Rey”:amazon by Thornton Wilder. Wonderful book. Makes you want to run to Peru. The bittersweetness of a colonial capital really comes thru – the center of local society, but longs to be respected by the mother society half a world away. The characters and outcomes are oh so human. * “The Stranger”:amazon by Camus. Certainly a strong story. A strong lesson about failure to commit to and connect with the world. A little harder to connect with than San Luis Rey – it is much harder to put yourself in the lead character’s shoes.</p>

<p>And I didn’t read it yet but was motivated by <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001239.php">this review to order Sahara Overland</a> – sounds fascinating.</p>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">31 May 2006</p>
			</div>

			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>Our family room PC died this morning. Needed a new one in a hurry – this is a mission critical PC at home. I usually build my own or order from a boutique oem but no time, so out to the closest stores – compusa, office depot, best buy, finally fry’s. The first 3 didn’t have any small form factor quiet PCs. Fry’s had an <a href="http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/store_access.do?template_type=product_detail&amp;product_code=ER189AA%23ABA">HP 7410</a> – small form factor, quiet, $529, Windows XP MCE. Seemed like a fine deal.</p>

<p>The ensuing 4 hours getting it running were painful. And it all comes down to the economics of the business that Microsoft has created and that the big PC OEMs promulgate. At these price points, the OEMs aren’t making enough money to make it worth their while, so they spend an extraordinary amount of effort trying to get you to part with more money post-purchase, and they work hard to collect bounties from various service and software providers.</p>

<p>As a result, you have to wade thru literally hours of crap to get the pc in a reasonable state. Of course there is all the normal Microsoft registration and activation upfront. Then you have to wade thru the HP screens pitching you on an extended warranty offer. Then you have to wade thru HP screens pitching you on internet access offers even though you are already on the internet, dammit. Then you have to register with HP and give them permission to update your computer and spam you with various alerts and notifications (which are probably designed to extract more money from you).</p>

<p>Then you get to activate the Symantec suite that is on the box, which expires in 60 days. I’ll get another chance to give HP and Symantec money in 2 months.</p>

<p>Once you are thru all this chattering you get to your Windows desktop finally. Where you find a trial version of Microsoft Money. Of Quicken. Of Microsoft Office. Of Rhapsody and all its attendant software. AOL. AOL Music. AOL Latino. Ebay (is this software or just a link to ebay? I’m not clicking). MSN. MSN Encarta. Easy Internet Signup (didn’t I already deal with this?). HP Extended Service Plans (Ditto). HP Photosmart. Netscape. Snapfish. A jillion trial games, powered by Wildtangent – I imagine you have to pay to get full versions, but again I’m not clicking.</p>

<p>This is all splattered all over the desktop, the quickstart bar, and some of it on the icon bar – why does symantec need two notification icons? Oh and the java runtime is installed and immediately updates itself, and offers to install the google desktop and toolbar for you.</p>

<p>Of course your home page for IE is set to Netscape, oh joy.</p>

<p>You have to wade thru and delete most of this crap, and of course there is nothing preinstalled that I really need – like the huge set of Windows Updates I have to immediately download – 32 of them. Or the drivers for my existing mouse and keyboard – microsoft brand. Another half hour or more of futzing around to get all this right.</p>

<p>Basically the pc business model as promulgated by ms and big name oems is corrupt. To make ends meet, the oems resort to all this crap that is the moral equivalent of spam – I didn’t ask for it, it isn’t explained at purchase time, I never gave anyone permission to slam it all over my system.</p>

<p>I’d rather pay a honest price up front for a system that respects me and is truly personal. No wonder apple is resurgent.</p>

<p>What would I do with this info if I was a college student? Obviously work hard to find a great entry position.

				<p><p>Haven’t had much opportunity to travel in the last year but hopefully will get the chance to do so. In the meantime there are some trips I am dying to take and I might as well collect all the links so I can quickly organize when I get the chance.</p>

<p>I’ve been dying to go to Chile for many years now. The natural beauty really calls to me. The highlight of my trip will be an <a href="http://www.earthriver.com/expeditions.asp?expedition=futaleufu&amp;ss=3&amp;header=3">Earth River expedition in Patagonia</a>. This pretty much pins the trip to the Chilean summer months – December thru March.</p>

<p>Certainly I’ll want to spend time before or after the river in and around Santiago – some online guides:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://travel2.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/travel/21wdsantiago.html?ex=1148356800&amp;en=fb85c387349d5bd6&amp;ei=5070">NYtimes</a> * <a href="http://www.contactchile.cl/en/news-chile.php">ContactChile</a> * <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ci.html">CIA factbook on Chile</a> * <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1088.html">Consular Information Sheet</a> from the state department * <a href="http://www.fodors.com/miniguides/mgresults.cfm?destination=santiago@141">Fodor’s</a>, <a href="http://cityguide.travel-guides.com/city/city_guide.ehtml?o=110">World Travel Guide</a>, <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g294305-Santiago-Vacations.html">TripAdvisor</a></p>

<p>And then probably will want to get out of Santiago and see one other part of the country…not sure where…maybe should stay in Lake District a while at end of rafting trip tho maybe I’d be all watered out at that point? Or maybe Valparaiso and Vina del Mar in central Chile – <a href="http://gosouthamerica.about.com/cs/southamerica/a/ChiDrmTripCntr.htm">here is one guy’s idea of an itinerary</a>. Easter Island would be a fascinating choice too but that just doesn’t feel to me like really getting to know Chile. Maybe the wine district – stay at <a href="http://www.jahuel.cl/">Termas Jahuel</a>.</p>
