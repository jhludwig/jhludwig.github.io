    <p>So, with <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/003946.html?wbfrom=rss">Yahoo’s inevitable announcement of Yahoo desktop search</a> – just how many freakin’ indexers are we all going to have to run on our machines? I am going to need a multicore proc and dedicate one of the cores to running the google indexer, the yahoo indexer, the lookout/msn indexer, the winxp indexing service. and then of course all the media player and photo indexers that come built into all these apps.</p>

<p>Longhorn was purportedly going to solve this but now <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9135">winfs may not even be in the release after longhorn</a>, at least that is how I read this article.</p>

<p>So the market for fs value-add utilities will be strong for the rest of the decade – not just indexers, but replicators and synchers like <a href="http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Linux.html">unison</a>, <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001746.html">software raid and other lower level solutions</a>, etc. We all have way too much free disk space at our disposal, software will spring up to use it for reliability, performance, ease of use.</p>

  <h1><a href="/blog/2004/12/10/xp-server-iis-dns-client.html">XP Server, IIS, DNS Client</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>For some reason, about two weeks ago, my IIS server (that this site resides on) quit being able to resolve DNS names. I’ve tried changing my DNS servers, no avail. I’ve tried turning off and turning on the DNS Client Resolver, no avail. The only config change I have made recently is to turn on the WebDAV extension in IIS, I turned that off, no avail.</p>

<p>This happened to me when I first installed XP Server 2003 and it was due to a 3rd-party socket filter that i had to remove. Going to investigate that next. Also going to look at ways to log the traffic at the IP level as i try to hit a named site to see what is happening.</p>

<p>Static pages on the site work fine obviously, but any kind of dynamic page tends to fall over.</p>

<p>Maybe it is time to move to a hosted solution. Not really having fun chasing this crap down.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: used the Network Monitor utility in XP to see that, for whatever reason, the DNS servers I had been using were returning “name not found” to all my requests. Further dug in and found that our ISP had provided us new DNS servers to use for our DMZ boxes a couple weeks ago. All fixed up now. Don’t really understand why the old DNS servers were still operational and still responding to DNS requests at all, but onward and upward.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/12/10/hard-drive-industry-storage-functionality.html">Hard drive industry, storage functionality</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>First, an <a href="http://www.oligopolywatch.com/2004/12/06.html#a493">interesting article about profitability in the hard drive industry</a> – classic commodity economics are at play, and as consumers we are all benefiting.</p>

<p>At the same time, enterprise storage functionality is transitioning down to consumers – <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/storage/lacie-external-sata-drives-027389.php">external sata connectors</a> allowing really high speed detached storage, <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/linux/archives/20041210_instant_nas.phtml">lightweight nas solutions</a>, a bunch of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=software+raid">software raid solutions</a> – but it is all way too hard to use for most people.</p>

<p>Seems to me like there is a path out of commodity pricing for the hard drive guys. The first player to bring enterprise storage functionality – replication, auto-backup, hot swapping, pooling, etc – to consumers and small businesses in a brainlessly easy to use package could be a big winner.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.supremerestaurant.com/">Supreme</a> in Madrona. Loved it! Great neighborhood place, super service, great food, a calm and relaxing place. * <a href="http://www.serafinaseattle.com/">Serafina</a>. The food was good, we’d go back, but it was very crowded and a little frantic. Good if you are in the mood for that. * <a href="http://www.firenzerestaurant.com/">Firenze</a>. One of our consistent favorites. Not in a very promising space, but great food e.very time. * <a href="http://www.gourmetfoodplaza.com/Series/Restaurants/QueenCityGrill.htm">Queen City Grill</a>. Another consistently good place. Not as trendy as some of the places in Belltown, but always good. * <a href="http://www.flyingfishseattle.com/">Flying Fish</a>. Did the chef just change? We were very disappointed there recently. Every dish was bland and poorly cooked. It will take some dramatic change for us to ever go back.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/12/09/best-reads-of-the-year.html">Best reads of the year</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://www.openwave.com/us/news_room/press_releases/2003/20030915_opwv_reardon_0915.htm">Reardon</a> reminded me recently that I read a lot of books. I looked over <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/cat_books.html">the list</a> this year and was a little suprised myself. And what a lot of dreck in there, I wonder why I plow thru some of this.</p>

<p>But to save others from plowing thru the dreck, here is my short list of good reads this year. Some new, some quite old.</p>

<p><strong>Fiction</strong>:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312278497/qid=1081897958/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Glass Bead Game</a> by Hesse. 3/4s of a year later and I can still recollect vast swathes of the book as well as particular scenes. Well worth the time. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/103-6281811-4989432?index=blended&amp;keyword=The+Curious+Incident+of+the+Dog+in+the+Night-time">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</a>. Totally expected to hate it, thought it was just trendy, but this was a solid and memorable story. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802130208/qid=1082873989/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">A Confederacy of Dunces</a> by Toole. Great great characters, dying to be a movie. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/4770019572/qid=1084987282/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Musashi</a> from which I picked up <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001475.html">my favorite quote of the year.</a></p>

<p><strong>Non-fiction:</strong></p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm">The 9/11 Commission Report</a>. Again, every US citizen should read this. * And while you are at it, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Imperial Hubris</a>. At the very least, thought-provoking and internally consistent. * And lest these two depress you too much, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400041767/qid=1091718131/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig</a> for a view on a country and culture that is really screwed up.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/12/07/recent-software-trials.html">Recent software trials</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>* Via <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20041206_xraypc.phtml">lockergnome</a>, <a href="http://www.x-raypc.com/">XrayPC</a> – another useful tool for isolating spyware and other malware. Also note this review of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/apps/spyware-removal.ars">spyware fighters</a>. You probably should be running a couple tools on all your machines. The free tool as part of the <a href="http://toolbar.yahoo.com/">yahoo toolbar</a> is a great value. * <a href="http://www.otwesten.de/drivesitter/features.htm">Drivesitter</a>. I’m not sure why but I love these tools that watch your harddisk and attempt to predict failures. I have backups of everything important and so a HD failure is not catastrophic for me but it is a time waster and I’d like to know if a failure is imminent. * <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=50">MT Posting plugin for Newsgator</a>. Promises to combine two of my favorite pieces of software – alas it doesn’t work for me yet due to my security config, I’m in contact with Newsgator support. * <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg2/TheDailyGrind513.html">Mike points in here to PDF speedup</a> – man everyone needs to run this, the adobe reader is jammed so full of crap that most of us don’t need. * Now that I have finished Halflife 2 missions (though am still vastly entertained by the online deathmatch – gravity guns rule!), here’s a <a href="http://www.abandonia.com/index2.php">whole trove of free games</a> * Chris points to <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/16/71140.html">a bunch of nice editors</a>, one of these will probably find its way onto my machines. * <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8355e537-1ea6-4569-aabb-f248f4bd91d0">PortQueryUI</a> from MSFT. Haven’t had time to play with this yet but will soon. * Another from MSFT – a tool to see if have a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=de1491ac-0ab6-4990-943d-627e6ade9fcb">good MPEG decoder</a>. Why does the Windows Media Player make your codec config such a mystery? It is hard to tell what you have installed, unless you grovel the registry.</p>

<p>Lastly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2004/12/01/273160.aspx">a nice post from LarryO about hiding complexity</a>. This sure feels like the reason a lot of software goes wrong…</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/12/07/imperial-hubris.html">Imperial Hubris</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>I picked this up based on <a href="http://www.tongfamily.blog">Rich</a>’s reco. So the first 90% of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-2817119-8833737?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Imperial Hubris</a> just pissed me off, I thought the author was just being an apologist for Osama, explaining again and again the rationale for his actions and the support he enjoys.</p>

<p>But the close of the books was great. Two messages. One, we are at war, let’s quit pussyfooting around, let’s apply the full weight of our force on a focused effort to win. Two, let’s at least have a discussion about the policies that have forced us into war – our energy policies, our support for autocratic regimes, our unflagging support for Israel. Maybe these are the right policies, maybe not, but let’s at least have a discussion and agree that they are worth a war.</p>

<p>I feel a little shamed that I am not sacrificing much personally in this war. Here’s <a href="http://www.windsofchange.net/archives/003234.php">a pointer again to a great post about how we can support the troops.</a></p>

    <p><a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2004/12/the_real_winner.html">Martin’s been doing a lot of posting</a> on his experiences with online retailers this season. Thought I’d share mine:</p>

<p>* <strong>Best</strong>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.cyberguys.com">Cyberguys</a>, <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a>, <a href="http://www.redenvelope.com">Red Envelope</a>, <a href="http://www.duluthtrading.com">Duluth Trading</a>. None of these sites are price leaders but they accurately report what they have in stock and what you can really get. I hate sites that promise stock they don’t have.

Certainly the development of a community of developers and partners as the above links illustrate is a powerful asset for Apple. As a 4 iPod household, I’ve certainly voted with my feet. But…it is not a very sticky experience, I could move all my media to a competitive player tomorrow and lose very little. A network of related apps and solutions might start to create stickiness.</p>

    <p>For some reason my site is the top google listing for <a href="http://www.exclusiveresorts.com">exclusive resorts</a>, based on a <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001196.html">simple old posting</a> I did. Unclear why.</p>

<p>I recently refreshed the posting to have the <a href="http://www.exclusiveresorts.com">correct url</a>, after being contacted by one of the co-founders, a nice guy.</p>

<p>I’d really love to be a customer, their sites look great. It just doesn’t work for us now tho because a) we have limited vacation times, driven by conflicting school and scholastic sports schedules, and b) we just love a couple places – <a href="http://www.konavillage.com/">kona village resort</a>, <a href="http://www.canyonranch.com/Tucson/index.asp">canyon ranch tucson</a> – and don’t have the time or motivation to branch out.</p>

<p>But if we could, exclusive looks great.</p>
