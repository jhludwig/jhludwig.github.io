A great machine for the kind of portable computing I do – small, easy to carry around, but a reasonable keyboard and reasonable screen and reasonable performance. I don’t understand why this class of machine is not sold in the US market, I had an old VAIO with this form factor and loved it, and I love this one even more.</p>

<p>(I used it Sunday at a Starbucks in some crummy little strip mall and was suprised to find no less than 4 WIFI networks available to me beyond the T-Mobile fee-based network. Starbucks has to be happy, I still went to their store and bought a drink, even tho I didn’t use their network).</p>

    <p>Haven’t harvested the <a href="http://www.methodzofmadness.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi">halloween sig</a> i follow for good ideas recently. Time to start that back up. Here are some interesting ides:</p>

<p>* Just use a loud bass rumble for a good atmospheric effect. * RIP the soundtracks from game CDs (Doom for instance), they have great atmospheric sound * a <a href="http://www.sprawlingdelusions.com/Projects/Midi/MidiInstructions/DCCSetup.htm">cubase plugin for controlling props via MIDI</a> – Delusional Creature Controller. (ok this has nothing to do with sound effects but i drew some connection between sound and midi) * Dungeonkeeper is another PC game with apparently a great atmospheric soundtrack * Some people have been locating their air compressors within their haunt – the sound of the compressor firing up can give people a good startle – great idea, I have mine hidden behind the house right now.</p>

    <p>Again harvesting the halloween sig, a bunch of ideas for prop building:</p>

<p>* When looking for scrap juicers as motors in props (for instance an axworthy ghost), look for metal body juicers – a lot tougher than the plastic juicers. * Use a Fishtank bubbler as source of bubbles in mad scientist lab – cheap and easy! * Lots of folks using windshield wiper motors for props. Some very nice characteristics – back and forth repetitive motion, speed and intermittency controllable. Trying to achieve this kind of output with a standard rotary motor would be very complicated. * How to <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/nc2/CreatureOTNight/demon.htm">demonify a skull</a> * <a href="http://www.boopack.com/software.html">4 bar simulation software</a> – very helpful for pneumatic design * a bunch of <a href="http://www.stuartizm.com/skulls.htm">skulls and skull sections</a> for use in projects. Oh and a source for inexpensive <a href="http://www.crypticimports.com/catalog.html">skulls in bulk.</a></p>

Both have a very haunting view of humanity decimated by a genius who thinks he has a better plan for the world. Both extremely sad, Kalki will probably stick with me better perhaps because I read it first. But O&amp;C was a good read too; had I not encountered Kalki, I would have considered O&amp;C one of the best apocalyptic stories around. I don’t really think we are on the path to the dystopia described in O&amp;C but a good read.</p>

    <p>Spent a good part of yesterday eradicating this <a href="http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=WORM_LOVGATE.G">Virus</a> from one of our machines – it was pretty invasive. One virus removal tool was not enough, I had to do multi-passes and some hand scrubbing too.</p>

<p>This is on a machine that hasn’t downloaded anything and has no email access. The only software that has explicitly entered it is game software – I wonder if the new Counterstrike CD had a virus on it…</p>

    <p>Sitting in the weekly partner meeting at Ignition, I couldn’t help but feel that business is booming. I heard updates on a lot of our portfolio companies – <a href="http://www.melodeo.com/">Melodeo – Tune The Planet</a>, <a href="http://www.clearsightsystems.com/">Clearsight Systems – Get The Right Answer</a> (hey they even have a <a href="http://www.clearsightsystems.com/mathlog/default.asp">blog like thing</a>), <a href="http://www.intelligent-results.com/">Intelligent Results</a>, <a href="http://www.interactnetworks.com/">Interact Networks – Proactive Network Scannings &amp; Vulnerability Detection</a>, <a href="http://www.cloudmark.com/">Cloudmark – Your Spam Authority</a>, <a href="http://www.teranode.com/">Teranode – Design Tools for the Life Sciences</a> – they all sound like they are making great progress. Great product work in the pipeline, and good revenue progress across the board. It was a pretty uplifting meeting.</p>

<p>And we discussed a bunch of prospective deals, it is an active market with a lot of great entrepreneurs and young companies. It felt good to be involved with the group of people here at Ignition and with the people at our companies.</p>

<p>Funniest comment of the day – when asked about the merits of a prospective investment partner, someone said ?They have good hygiene and they do no harm.? :) Hey I hope I can live up to this standard as an investor, you could do a lot worse.</p>

I thought the ending was a little anticlimactic but how would you end this spiral of chaos?</p>

<p>Is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=confederacy+dunces+movie">the movie</a> really getting made? Will Ferrell would be awesome in the role but after a flurry of news last year, all the movie sites seem silent about the movie.</p>

They cut WinFS??</a> – sounds like maybe WinFS hasn’t been scaled back much, tho this posting is pretty vague about how it works on legacy media and networks (a reasonably hard problem). It certainly hints that WinFS will work just fine on a network against a remote WinFS machine – Longhorn or Longhorn server.</p>

Very helpful, I have 9 machines I manage and I can never keep straight which one has which key. Thanks Kevin</p>

The last thing we need is for them to have to go meet with the President. They are and should be empowered by the law to take action.</em></p>

<p>Not just government employees – it is the job of every citizen to fight for our rights, to build the economy, to defend our country, etc. None of us should sit back and wait for the government to fix every problem out there.</p>

    <p>Nice roundup of reviews at gizmodo – <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/nvidia_geforce_6800ultra_review_roundup_015088.php" title="Nvidia GeForce 6800Ultra Review Roundup">Nvidia GeForce 6800Ultra Review Roundup</a> – it’s time to upgrade video cards again. I continue to find it interesting that today’s apps have an unquenchable demand for GPU MIPs, while my appetite for more CPU MIPs isn’t that great. This has interesting implications in the longrun for Intel, for the balance of power in the industry, etc.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2004/04/13/the-glass-bead-game.html">The Glass Bead Game</a></h1><div class="content">
    <p>For my first Hesse ever, I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312278497/qid=1081897958/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-2952831-9460018?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi)">The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi)</a>. I found it to be a pretty provoking read that seems still quite relevant today – certainly a valuable read for anyone considering a deep investment in higher education. And I found the structure of the book (intro to the game; biography; posthumous writings of Knecht) interesting and a break from the typical structure of most novels.</p>

<p>Clearly the book has some obsessive fans – just search the web for “Magister Ludi”, “Joseph Knecht”, or “Glass Bead Game” (I think these people miss the point of the book).</p>

<p>I had a goal earlier this year to read a new and different magazine each week – this book made me drop that goal. It was a compelling piece of writing, and made me realize that most magazines consist of a bag of ads interspersed with whatever articles were available at deadline. OK that is a little cynical but I still think I’ll use my reading time to read more substantial and provoking works.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.simson.net/blog/archives/000063.php" title="Simson's Weblog: Looking Back at MIT">Simson’s Weblog: Looking Back at MIT</a> – My own experience doesn’t support the “Grades really matter” point but then I generally had decent grades. But all the rest of this counsel seems very wise. Choice of major really really doesn’t matter – what matters is that you learn how to think – how to analyze and synthesize – not so much what you think about. My undergraduate years were all about analysis, I didn’t really learn much synthesis until graduate school, you need both.</p>
