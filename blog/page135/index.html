    <p><strong>threedegrees – ha ha ha ha ha</strong>. It is the day for bad technology experiences I guess. I installed the <a href="http://www.threedegrees.com">threedegrees</a> beta from Microsoft. Firstly just a laughable install for a consumer product – i had to download and install a separate system component, i had to reboot, i had to register AND i had to log in with my passport AND i had to provide the double secret beta key, and i had to use the miserable microsoft download manager. Then when i tried to use it, it gave me some error message about my IPv6 stack not being properly configured! an IPv6 stack that it had installed. Just hilarious – who would build a dependency on an IPv6 stack into a consumer product?</p>

    <p><strong>Miserable experience with Alienware</strong>. I have nearly begged <a href="http://www.alienware.com/main/main.asp?">Alienware</a> to take my money for a new machine. After nearly a month trying to get them to take my money, I give up. Because I wanted to ship the machine to my office, while my credit card bills go to my home address, they required a fax of my driver’s license (why I don’t know). I faxed it to them 4 times over two days as two different people called me to complain that they couldn’t read the expiration date. I zoomed the license and toned down the contrast so that the expiration date was as visible as possible. I thought they were happy and I went away on vacation. I got back after two weeks and – no machine. I contacted them and they said they still couldn’t read the license and are still waiting for me to fax me a new one, though they hadn’t bothered to call me. In this time of course a credit card charge could have cleared but no, that apparently isn’t good enough for them, somehow a faxed copy of a driver’s license is the key to their entire system. Today I gave up, I’ll order from someone else.</p>

    <p><strong>Bellevue and nukes</strong>. From a colleague who knows better than I do, answering the question “If Seattle was targetted by a nuke, would we be safe here in Bellevue?”:</p>

<p><em>Depends on the size. The Hiroshima (fission) bomb had a lethal radius of 2 - 3 miles. Large fusion bombs (very hard to make, North Korea can’t produce them) could have a lethal radius up to 30 miles. I would want to be further away then Bellevue if downtown Seattle was hit. Also, its very hard to make a long range missile accurate. The probable accuracy of a North Korean missile is 1 - 2 miles (or worse) at that range. Go to Monroe!</em></p>

Great weather, lots of humpback whales, a fun trip up to the caldera, some good stargazing. No Blackberry coverage, no laptop, no internet terminals, no cellphone, no tv for most of the stay – it was great to disconnect, I am thinking about going internet/pc/tv free on every saturday from now on.</p>

Duh. This should have been their plan A all along. Obviously PC OEMs are willing to ship a lot of software – look at all the shovelware that comes on a new PC. The fact that they haven’t been willing to ship the JVM is really telling – it is saying that a Java VM is more useless than every other piece of cruddy software that they ship – this is truly stunning given the quality of some of the shovelware. Sun should listen to OEMs and build a few Java apps that actually solve some interesting OEM problems, and then every OEM would take the apps and the VM.</p>

    <p><strong>RSS aggregator inside my IM client.</strong> I’d really love a simple RSS aggregator inside my IM client. One that would a) automagically get the correct URL for my buddy’s RSS feeds from the IM service – perhaps a normalized form in their comments field or other fields; b) let me know when my buddies post a new post or picture, c) let me know when my buddies post a comment to my site or a trackback to my site. I don’t want the full set of RSS headlines in the IM client, just the ones that have been posted in say the last hour (or whatever I configure the trigger to be). I started thinking about this today as I was thinking about picture sharing with my family – I already have a list of my family members in my AIM and MSN IM clients, why can’t I just put some notifications up there from them?</p>

<p>The APIs for plugging into MSN IM are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/topic.asp?url=/msdn-files/028/001/359/topic.xml">here</a>. Looks like you have to write a COM component, yuck, not my forte. I can’t find the AIM APIs, I am still digging.</p>

    <p><strong>Your Strategy Is What You Ship</strong>. I was reminded of this quote today, taught to me when I was a snot-nosed inexperienced consulting brat in the strategy practice of <a href="http://www.bah.com">Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton</a>. One of the more experienced consultants in the operations practice sneered at some inane observation I made one day and said “Your strategy is what you ship”.</p>

<p>Today’s strategy lesson – Microsoft’s developer tools and platform sdks. I am an MSDN subscriber and I get absolutely pounds of CDs from Microsoft and gigabytes of articles, tools, libraries, etc. It is a dizzying and confusing array of tools – and relatively pricey too. The imputed strategy here is “Microsoft only cares about enterprise developers – if you are a young, starving, novice programmer, there is no entry path to the Microsoft platform. You should go use PHP and Perl and Python and other environments that are cheap and easy to start with.” I doubt this is what any slidedeck at Microsoft says but that is sure how it feels.</p>
