<p><strong>Volleyball Season Finale</strong></p>

<p>Well L’s volleyball season ended today at the district tournaments in Edmonds. This was the first time that Forest Ridge had ever made it to the district tournaments and they faced a set of very tough teams. In their first match they lost to <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/cgi-bin/ia_find?link=btwn%2Ftwn-map_results&amp;random=565&amp;event=find_search&amp;SNVData=&amp;address=&amp;city=orcas+island&amp;State=wa&amp;Zip=&amp;Find+Map.x=48&amp;Find+Map.y=9">Orcas Island</a> High School in a hard fought match. In their second match they were eliminated by <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/cgi-bin/ia_find?link=btwn%2Ftwn-map_results&amp;random=442&amp;event=find_search&amp;uid=ud.7u0p3u3yac2ed%3At0968a948&amp;SNVData=3mad3-9.fy%2528at2u67_%2529f82u67%253bah7-%253d%253a%2528_%253d%253abad672%253d%253d1su672%253d0%2Crb%253b7%253bb5m-r2qfj5m%253be10h%25284&amp;MAP_AB_LABELS=&amp;WORK=&amp;country=United+States&amp;address=&amp;city=laConner&amp;State=wa&amp;Zip=&amp;Find+Map=Get+Map">LaConner</a> High School.</p>

<p>It was a great experience for the team. They experienced the atmosphere and intensity of the district tournament for the first time. Despite losing, they all had a great time and felt great about their day. L’s team is made up predominantly of juniors so they fully expect to be back at the districts next year.</p>
