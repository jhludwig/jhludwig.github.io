<p><strong>Carter Beats The Devil</strong></p>

<p>What a great fun <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786867345/ref=bxgy_sr_text_b/103-3066965-9735824">book</a>. John and I have both read it, it is a great yarn. And for those with a Marion, Ohio background, it has just enough mentions of Marion and Harding and Nan Britton to make you feel right at home.</p>
