<p><strong>Halloween!</strong></p>

<p>Wow we had a great night. I’d estimate that we had 250-300 kids visiting – we gave away a LOT of candy. All of L’s friends and their families came, as did J’s friends and families. And we had neighbors, and some coworkers, and whoever else happened to stop by. A fun night.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.americandj.com/product.asp?ProductIDNumber=947&amp;cat=Hightech">flamelights</a> we had in our upstairs windows really looked great.</p>

<p>People always love <a href="http://www.boneyardbargains.com/">skeletons</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://members.aol.com/hmpi/">glowing red eyes</a> peeking out from dark corners and bushes really fascinated some of the young kids. Very inexpensive.</p>

<p>The fog as always was great. And we had super weather – scattered clouds, breezy, a beautiful full moon.</p>

<p>Lowlights:</p>

<p>Just one. As the party was breaking up, someone accidentally grabbed J’s trick or treat bag and left with it. All the candy he had worked hard to collect was gone. A serious downer at the end of the evening. We have plenty of candy left over, so he won’t go short on candy, but it is not the same as the candy he collected, which had stories and memories of the night associated with it.</p>
