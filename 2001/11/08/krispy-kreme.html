<p><strong>Krispy Kreme</strong></p>

<p>OK folks it is just a doughnut. Why this town has gone <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis/web/vortex/display?slug=krispy31&amp;date=20011031&amp;query=krispy+kreme">nuts</a> over them I do not understand.</p>

<p>I guess we don’t have the <a href="http://www.mariners.org/">Mariners</a> to talk about any more. No one cares enough about the <a href="http://www.seahawks.com/">Seahawks</a> to talk about them. The crummy local weather is old news. And the national news scene is just not very uplifting.</p>

<p>So we obsess about doughnuts. Topic number one every morning is <a href="http://www.krispykreme.com/">Krispy Kreme</a> gossip – how long is the line, have you had one yet, did you hear about the 5 additional outlets they are going to open in the Seattle area.</p>

<p>If we could only get a <a href="http://www.whitecastle.com/home.asp">White Castle</a> now…</p>
