<p><strong>This Day In History</strong></p>

<p>First of all, when it comes to doughnuts, we’re <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134366136_bizbriefs14.html">#1!</a></p>

<p>I hope the <a href="http://www.king5.com/topstories/10014371_WX1114windandrainstorm.html">weather</a> doesn’t prevent us from consuming even more doughnuts.</p>

<p>More importantly, let’s wish the microprocessor a happy <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-7865172-0.html?tag=tp_pr">birthday</a>. In one form or another it has had a huge impact on our lives. Certainly on my life anyway.</p>

<p>I still remember the first <a href="http://www.electronicjungle.com/bow_mx25.html">Bowmar Brain</a> that Dad brought home. Wow. I was entranced. I soon graduated to the <a href="http://www.ti59.com/">TI-59</a>, which introduced me to primitive programming. Then I managed to buy a <a href="http://www.99er.net/994.html">TI 99/4</a> and had my first personal computing experience. This machine was a dog but the notion of personal computing was infectious for me.</p>

<p>I quickly ditched the TI (which again was a dog) and got an Apple ][<a href="http://apple2history.org/"></a> which was a great machine. I loved buying software in ziplock bags at the <a href="http://www.microcenter.com/">Microcenter</a> on Lane Avenue. I loved the huge market of addon cards. I loved the nascent computer industry press – Byte magazine and Creative Computing were my monthly bibles.</p>

<p>Then I read an article about the <a href="http://www.smalltalk.org/main.html">Smalltalk</a> programming environment in <a href="http://www.byte.com/">Byte</a> magazine and was hooked on the idea of a graphical interface, and bought a <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Mac</a> at the first possible moment – my second year in grad school, C and I had absolutely no money, but I managed to buy a Mac the first day it was on the market.</p>

<p>Then I moved out west here and had to adopt <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.asp">Windows</a> and PCs wholeheartedly. By now I am probably on my 20th Windows PC in the workplace and probably 10th at home – my latest being a hardcore game machine from <a href="http://www.alienware.com/index_yesflash.asp">Alienware</a>.</p>

<p>And of course I now use microprocessors in about 100 other machines in my daily life – in my stereo, in my car, in my MP3 player, in my <a href="http://www.mot.com/LMPS/iDEN/products/i85s/i85s.html">cell phone</a>, in my <a href="http://www.blackberry.net/">Blackberry</a>, etc…</p>

<p>It has been fun so far…</p>
