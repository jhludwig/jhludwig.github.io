<p><strong>Gosh sorry for being gone so long</strong></p>

<p>This is a super busy season for us – Thanksgiving, then L’s birthday on 11/20, then C’s birthday on 12/5, then J’s birthday on 12/15. Of course, Christmas and New Year’s coming.</p>

<p>Birthday highlights – L is heading to the <a href="http://www.kiss1061.com/jbb">Jingle Bell Bash</a> tonight with her friends for a big night out. Should be major fun. J took his group of friends to the <a href="http://www.illusionz.com/games.html">local lasertag emporium</a> – I think I enjoyed that as much as anyone. And on C’s birthday, the <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis/web/vortex/display?slug=ship06&amp;date=20011206&amp;query=christmas+ships">Christmas ships</a> stopped in front of our house and did their annual carol concert – wonderful timing.</p>

<p>Volleyball continues to keep L busy. Her high school team had their end of season awards banquet on Friday, and L won the Coach’s Award for the third year running, and she won awards for having the best service percentage and the greatest number of assists. Oh and she was named to the first team league all-star team. She is also getting busy now with her <a href="http://www.volleyballnw.com/JrVBclub/default.htm">club volleyball team</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday we all attended a Christmas singalong with the Choral Arts Northwest troupe at the <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/s-scripts/serve.pl">symphony hall</a> here in Seattle. A great time, C and I both loved their rendition of “still, still, still”. There is something about a great choir performance that is so uplifting.</p>

<p>Happy Holidays to you all.</p>
