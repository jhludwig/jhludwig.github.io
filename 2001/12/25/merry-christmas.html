<p><strong>Merry Christmas!</strong></p>

<p>Hope everyone is having a great day. We are all well and enjoying the day together.</p>

<p>This past weekend we went to see, among other things, a performance by <a href="http://www.bobs.com/">The Bobs</a>. What an amazing group. They did some great a capella holiday music, and the most astounding a capella version of Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze”. I know this sounds bizarre, it was but it was great. Worth a night out if they ever come your way.</p>

<p>We also saw two movies this weekend – <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</a>, and <a href="http://www.abeautifulmind.com/">A Beautiful Mind</a>. Both great flicks.</p>

<p>If I had to choose between them and a night with The Bobs, The Bobs would win every time.</p>

<p>L begs to differ. She thought The Bobs were scary.</p>
