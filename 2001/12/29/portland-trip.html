<p><strong>Portland Trip</strong></p>

<p>We had a nice trip down to Portland. What a great city â€“ feels much more old world than Seattle. Narrower streets, older buildings, just a lot more style. A great city for walking around. ANd you have to love no sales tax.</p>

<p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.heathmanhotel.com/home.htm">Heathman Hotel</a>. We recommend it if you ever get Portland way. A beautiful lobby in which they host a holiday tea. It was booked too far in advance for us to partake but we will try to do so in the future.</p>

<p>We visited <a href="http://web.reed.edu/">Reed</a> and <a href="http://www.lclark.edu/">Lewis and Clark</a> Colleges. Both beautiful campuses. Reed felt more like a midwest or east coast campus with older buildings and a lot of deciduous trees in a suburban setting. Reed has about 1400 undergrads, 77% from outside the Northwest. It is a very short drive into downtown Portland.</p>

<p>Lewis and Clark is a bit further out, also in a suburban neighborhood. The campus feels more typically northwest with a lot of douglas firs, etc. A little larger than Reed, about 1800 undergrads.</p>

<p>A great trip and I am sure we will go back to at least Reed when L starts making formal visits this spring.</p>
