<p><strong>Whistle While You Work</strong></p>

<p>I wish I had the time of an 11 year old.</p>

<p>John spent nearly every waking moment this past weekend learning how to <a href="http://www.learn2.com/08/0876/0876.asp">whistle</a>. He made pretty good progress – Friday night all he could produce was a breathy puffing sound. By Sunday he was able to make a reasonable whistle, tho he can’t vary the tone much yet. I guess that is next weekend’s goal.</p>

<p>We of course are all going insane.</p>
