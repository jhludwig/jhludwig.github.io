<p><strong>250G Drives</strong>. Like <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/">Rich</a>, I love the sound of these. But I was talking to someone who runs a large server farm and he pointed out that access times are not increasing with disk size, in fact they are driven down. His farm limits themselves to 70G drives with 15,500 RPM for best performance. With all the vidcap I am doing, this may become a real issue but the high RPM drives are quite expensive.</p>
