<p><strong>Forest Ridge Board meeting</strong>. We had a great board retreat last week. Some really great people on the board – Mike Russell at <a href="http://www.accenture.com">Accenture</a> and Walt Orlowski (formerly of MD and <a href="http://www.boeing.com">Boeing</a>) are great new additions to the board. I really enjoyed their articulation of the challenging market we face – every school is getting better, we have to improve just to keep our current enrollment – and of the need to have a strong quantative assessment of the market as the baseline for our planning. Really good vibe.</p>
