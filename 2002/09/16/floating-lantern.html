<p><strong>Floating Lantern</strong>. Got mine built and trialed yesterday – <a href="http://members.accesstoledo.com/kkrazykkaren/Floating/Lantern.html">Floating Lantern</a>. Very nice looking. I downsized a little and used a different lantern and lamp element but otherwise pretty much per these plans. I think i’d like a little higher rpm motor given the smaller diameter of the effect but it still looks good.</p>
