<p><strong>Ray Ozzie and Multi Modality</strong>. Couldn’t agree more with Ray’s argument – <a href="http://www.ozzie.net/blog/stories/2002/09/20/ifAllThatYouHaveIsAHammerEverythingLooksLikeABrowser.html">If all that you have is a hammer, everything looks like a browser.</a> Everytime we’ve tried to cram more stuff into a single page, the resultant single page (for instance the msn portal page, or the outlook today page) becomes so general to be useless, or becomes bloated. It becomes useful only, as ray says, to people who are only online infrequently – certainly this is what the portal homepage has become.</p>
