<p><strong>Ebizjets</strong>. One of my partners succumbed and is now an <a href="http://www.sentientjet.com/home.asp?from=ebizjets">ebizjets</a> member. Very interesting idea. I wonder if the prices will go down – today’s WSJ discussed a glut of business jets. Resale prices have certainly dropped. The claim in the article is that fractional rates won’t drop, implying that the economics were driven by operating costs (which haven’t dropped), not capital costs. I wonder tho.</p>
