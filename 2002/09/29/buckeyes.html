<p><strong>Buckeyes</strong>. Nice game yesterday – good thing Maurice was back. But the offense had a little more depth – Gamble played well, Krenzel started to hit receivers. The dispatch posts a nice <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/news/sports02/sep02/osu-ind/index.php?template=dispatch">photo gallery</a> from each game by the way.</p>

<p>Two more games (Northwestern and SJ State) to work the kinks out before the brutal Penn State/Wisconsin back-to-back. That will be the measure of this team – can they focus and put away these first two teams they ought to beat, and then survive two tough opponents back-to-back. If the Buckeyes are still undefeated on Halloween then they will be quite a team.</p>
