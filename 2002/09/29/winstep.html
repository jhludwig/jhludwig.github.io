<p><strong>Winstep</strong>. I keep seeing cool content for this on lockergnome. Going to dive in and try <a href="http://www.winstep.net/">WinStep</a>. Ok I tried it. Canâ€™t say I love it. More extreme stylistic control over my start menu, taskbar, but not clear this actually helps me any. Many of the designs are unreadable. Not for me. I want a shell replacement that is more functional, not one that is just different looking and potentially more expressive.</p>
