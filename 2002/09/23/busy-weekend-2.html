<p><strong>Busy Halloween Prep Weekend.</strong> Busy busy making tombstones and other props – I love foamboard and stonelook paint from Home Depot (I can’t provide links as they don’t seem to sell them online). While a lot of people recommended electric carving knives as the way to do the largescale cutting of foamboard, I found mine to be ineffective on the 2” thick foamboard I bought. Also been horsing around with small motors to use in props – as recommended on some of the project lists pointed to on my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html">halloween blog</a>, small appliance motors work great in a lot of projects – for example orange juicer motors, easily available at <a href="http://www.valuevillage.com/corpsplashvv.html">Value Village</a>. You just take out the pressure switch and you have a nice cheap durable motor.</p>
