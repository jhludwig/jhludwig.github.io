<p><strong>Extra PCs</strong>. I have 4 PCs in my house that see regular use. Because I keep upgrading these, I am starting to accumulate a pile of old PCs that are not really doing anything. I have 3 right now that are just rusting away. They don’t have enough storage by modern standards to store much. I’ve tried to use them as print servers but a) using windows nt server as just a print server is overkill and more management hassle than i want, and b) using linux as a print server with windows clients seems to be more of a config hassle than I have time to deal with. I need to find some other uses that require modest compute cycles, and for which I can find low-hassle maintenance-free software.</p>
