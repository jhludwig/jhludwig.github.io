<p><strong>College Football RSS Feed</strong>. Was contacted by Andrew Koper – a michigan fan, boo – looking for a college football rankings rss feed. A great idea, i’d include on my page. Google and Syndic8 don’t seem to turn anything up. The feed only changes once a week, it would be easy to handcraft one. I might do so this weekend…</p>
