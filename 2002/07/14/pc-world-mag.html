      <td><strong>PC World Mag</strong>. Haven’t read this in a long time but picked it up on a lark. Hey it was actually useful. <a href="http://www.creo.com/sixdegrees/">Six Degrees</a> seems like something I should try, tho with my aggressive email deletion policy I wonder if it will do much for me. The utilities on the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/collection/0,collid,1210,00.asp">download section</a> seem interesting – filemon, regmon, registry drill, bugtoaster, commview. <a href="http://www.driverguide.com/">DriverGuide</a> seems like a good place to go to get drivers for old hardware like my NEC Z1. <a href="http://annoyances.org/">Annoyances.org</a> seems like a good forum for Windows issues. And [[H]ard</td>
      <td>OCP](http://www.hardocp.com/) seems like yet another good site for PC tweaking.</td>
