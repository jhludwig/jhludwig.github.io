<p><strong>Great game</strong>. Iâ€™ve been burning lots of time playing <a href="http://mohaa.ea.com/">Medal of Honor Allied Assault</a> -- awesome game. The Normandy Beach scenario feels amazing. My son is bugging me to start playing Warcraft III on our lan, but I have to get thru Medal of Honor first.</p>
