<p><strong>Ripping Video</strong>. I am step one into my attempt to rip all my home movies onto my PC, and then reburn them into a DVD that I can distribute to the family. I installed an <a href="http://www.ati.com/products/pc/aiwradeon8500dv/index.html">ATI All-in-Wonder</a> and used the Windows XP Movie Maker to transfer over the full digital content from my Canon GL1 via the 1394 connection. This worked very painlessly, tho the transfers happened at playback speed and I couldn’t seem to find any way to just bulk copy over the digital content.</p>

<p>Next up is to transfer all my old VHS-C analog content over via the all-in-wonder analog capture interfaces.</p>

<p>And I bought the HP DVD +RW writer (external), so i will then burn it all to a dvd. I’ll keep updating the blog with status.</p>
