<p><strong>Toshiba e740</strong>. OK i bought one so i can browse the web easily in boring meetings, in my family room, and at sbux. The price quoted on Amazon for pickup from Circuit City was as good as anything online, so I did it that way.</p>

<p>Pretty easy to get up and running tho the documentation about how to do so is terrible, particularly setting up the PC connection and software. And the documentation on the WIFI link is really limited.</p>

<p>I can see all my local WIFI nets but for some reason can’t get an IP address from our public DHCP server. I wonder if we are out of addresses.</p>
