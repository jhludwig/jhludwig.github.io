<p><strong>Digital IDs and Spam control</strong>. Hey I am a big fan of this idea, most recently mentioned on <a href="http://patrickweb.com/weblog/">John Patrick’s Weblog</a>. But I think we need to start talking a lot more about trust webs and how they will be managed, structured, discovered, trusted, etc. Digital IDs will help solve spam for about 2 weeks if we don’t create a structure to allow us to decide which digital IDs to trust and why.</p>
