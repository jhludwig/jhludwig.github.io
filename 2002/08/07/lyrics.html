<p><strong>Lyrics</strong>. Useful lyrics site – <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/index.html">A-Z Lyrics Universe</a>. I was looking for the lyrics to Foreigner’s “That Was Yesterday” which has been stuck in my head:</p>

<p><em>But that was yesterday I had the world in my hands But it’s not the end of my world Just a slight change of plans</em></p>

<p>A guilty pleasure. On a more fashionable note, the site also has the lyrics for all the White Stripes cds.</p>
