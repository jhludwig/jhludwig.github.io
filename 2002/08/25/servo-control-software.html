<p><strong>Servo Control Software</strong>. Lots of good discussion on the MOM site about servo control software. <a href="http://www.rentron.com/Robo-Ware.htm">Robo-Ware Robotics Servo Control Software</a> is recommended, supports downloads to basic stamps. <a href="http://www.brookshiresoftware.com/overview.htm">Visual Servo Automation - Overview - The Solution for Mini-SSC Servo Control Software</a> gets a lot of recommendations too but no download to basic stamps, you need to keep the PC in the picture.</p>
