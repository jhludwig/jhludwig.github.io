<p><strong>Torvalds on Patents</strong>. Couldn’t agree more – <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/7636/">LWN: Re: large page patch</a>. I refuse to look at patent material when startups try to present their patent portfolio to us. In fact, any startup that leads their presentation to us with “we have this bank of patents” I view with great suspicion – I suspect they are simply seeding the world with info about their patent so that they can claim knowing infringement later.</p>
