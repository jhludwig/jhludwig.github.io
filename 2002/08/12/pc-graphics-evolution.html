<p><strong>PC Graphics Evolution</strong>. Longish article on <a href="http://tech-report.com/etc/2002q3/nextgen-gpus/index.x?pg=1">PC Graphics Evolution</a>. Fun to read. Will be lots of reasons to keep on buying new PCs.</p>

<p>It is interesting that we have these hugely capable graphics coprocessors in our PCs now. Why don’t we have similar network coprocessors? With all the demand for wirespeed packet analysis/transformation (secure vpns, personal firewalls for instance) at higher and higher wirespeeds, seems to me like we will need more compute power dedicated to network traffic. I haven’t done the math tho to convince myself of the need.</p>
