<p><strong>SSL Not So Secure After All</strong>. From <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26620.html">The Register</a>, – Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and KDE’s Konqueror are both guilty of not following proper procedures when using sites that employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections.
