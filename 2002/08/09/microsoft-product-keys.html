<p><strong>Microsoft Product Keys</strong>. I get a consistent number of Google referrals of people looking for Microsoft Product Keys. The traffic seems to be growing. Hey folks I don’t post any keys here. Actually I wonder if the traffic isn’t from Microsoft or its agents looking for evidence of piracy.</p>

<p>UPDATE (7/3/07). Hey folks. THERE ARE NO PRODUCT KEYS HERE AND I AM NOT GOING TO HELP YOU FIND ONE. If you have a legitimate need for a key, call Microsoft.</p>

<p>This blog is predominately about <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/halloween/">Halloween</a>, <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/big10/ohio_state/">The Buckeyes</a>, <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Books/">books I’ve read</a>, and a variety of tech and business topics as they interest me. It is not about product keys.</p>
