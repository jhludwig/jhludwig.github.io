<p><strong>Outward Bound event</strong>. Liz and I think we’ll go to the <a href="http://www.pcobs.org/information/2col.asp?NavPageID=19855">Seattle Black Tie Benefit</a> for Outward Bound – looks like a lot of fun, more fun than a normal auction event. Interesting to read the corporate sponsorship list – <a href="http://www.endeavourcapital.com/">Endeavour Capital</a> looks interesting, a very different kind of investment firm than is Ignition, but very similar values – I suppose some of the principals there are Outward Bound alums.</p>
