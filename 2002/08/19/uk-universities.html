      <td><strong>UK Universities</strong>. One of the family wants to look at UK universities and colleges. Man am I dumb about these. My coworker Adrian Smith turned me onto <a href="http://www.ucas.com/">UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service)</a>, which seems to be the clearinghouse for applying to schools. There are some good online rankings sites as well – [EducationGuardian.co.uk</td>
      <td>University guide](http://education.guardian.co.uk/universityguide) for instance, and pointers to several at <a href="http://www.britishcouncil-usa.org/education/ratings.shtml">UK University Ratings</a>. Fascinating to dig into this – a whole different language of requirements, test scores, courses of study, etc.</td>
