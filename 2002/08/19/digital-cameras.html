<p><strong>Digital Cameras</strong>. <a href="http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/08/18.html">Ray Ozzie</a> likes the Canon Ex-S1. Not sure i can deal with 1.3Mpixels tho. I like the 4Mpixel images i get from my <a href="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/digital/easyShare/dx4900/dx4900.jhtml">Kodak DX4900</a>, which also has the nice dock and battery charger like the canon. a little bigger tho.</p>
