<p><strong>Gulf Islands</strong>. Just back from an 8 day trip in SW British Columbia. A couple days in Vancouver, a couple in Victoria, and a bunch in the middle in and around the Gulf Islands. <a href="http://www.vancouverisland.com/002regtown/towns/index.asp?townID=257">Ganges</a> is a nice little town. Sydney has a beautiful harbour. The baby beluga at the <a href="http://www.vanaqua.org/">Vancouver aquarium</a> was great.</p>

<p>I used our new Kodak DX4900 4Mpixel digital camera with the Easyshare dock. I really love the dock, recharging and downloading pictures is way easier than with past cameras Iâ€™ve used.</p>
