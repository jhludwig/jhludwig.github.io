<p><strong>RSS on PocketPC</strong>. Steve Makofsky turned me onto his <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/Programming/PocketFeed/index.aspx">PocketFeed</a> RSS aggregator for the PocketPC. Wow this is great! The web has been nearly useless on my toshiba wifi pocketpc but this makes a huge difference. I havenâ€™t been a huge fan of RSS but it provides me a ton of utility on my small screen device. I use Radio to create my list of sources and then import the <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/radio/gems/mySubscriptions.opml">OPML from Radio</a> into the Pocketfeed app. Way cool!</p>
