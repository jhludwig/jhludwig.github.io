<p><strong>Fireball</strong>. Brad Chase is looking at the <a href="http://www.escientconvergence.com/fireball.htm">Escient Fireball</a> as a potential media hub. certainly claims to do it all. expensive – i wonder if it is worth it. It all depends on the integration – I can do all this much more cheaply with a PC but I have to use 25 different pieces of software. If the fireball really makes it easy to do all the things it claims, the integration would be worth something.</p>
