<p><strong>OSU beats Texas Tech</strong>. A good first outing – <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=222360194">Recap - Texas Tech at Ohio State - 08/24/2002</a>. Great running game – linework, Maurice Clarett, way to go! A passing game that wasn’t a drawback tho there could be a lot of improvement. Signs of defensive strength tho they let too many points get on the board. On to Kent State!</p>
