<p><strong>Just Six Numbers</strong>. I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465036732/qid=1029962788/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-5849507-2126540?s=books&amp;n=507846">this book</a> a lot – fairly straightforward read about cosmology. I particularly like, in the discussion of dark matter, his analogy of the sea – dark matter as the bulk of the undersurface water that we never see, “bright” matter as the small layer of frothy stuff on top we can see. A very humbling view of our position in the universe.</p>

<p>And the Woody Allen quote is great – “Eternity is very long, especially towards the end.”</p>
