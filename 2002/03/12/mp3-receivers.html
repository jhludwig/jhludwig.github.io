<p><strong>MP3 Receivers</strong></p>

<p>My friends Sam and Brad are playing around with the <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/">SliMP3</a> receiver. Ripping all their CDs to a server in their house and then streaming the songs out to this receiver elsewhere in the house. A bleeding edge thing to do now, but the way we are all headed.</p>
