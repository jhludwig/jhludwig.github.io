<p><strong>Population Stats</strong>. I’m on the board of <a href="http://www.forestridge.org">Forest Ridge</a> and I am trying to get a good handle on demographics and population forecasts for the next 10-20 years. Here is what I have found so far – the <a href="http://www.edc-sea.org/research_data/economic_demographics.cfm">Economic Development Council of Seattle and King County</a>; and it’s source data from the <a href="http://www.ofm.wa.gov/popagesex19702020/popagesex19702020toc.htm">Washington State Office of Financial Management</a>. Very interesting – it suggests that the middle school population in the area is declining in size in the next 5-10 years.</p>
