<p><strong>Educational Stuff</strong>. Heading out on some college tours next week. <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwhonors/">University of Washington Honors Program</a> is first on our list, heading there next Wednesday. Then to Occidental Thursday, Claremont and Pepperdine Friday, Caltech and UCLA Saturday, with maybe a stop at USC sometime.</p>

<p>On the home front, recently bought and installed <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/">Mathematica</a> after wanting to for years. Kind of necessary as I help the kids with high school math homework â€“ it is getting tougher and tougher for me to keep up. Mathematica is great, going to take me a year to really dig into it.</p>
