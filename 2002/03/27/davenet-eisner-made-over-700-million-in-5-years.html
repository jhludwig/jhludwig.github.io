<blockquote>
  <p><em>I got interested in who Michael Eisner is. It didn’t take much time to find out, for example, via Forbes, that he made over $700 million in five years. At the same time he argues the financial interest of creative people. So which creative people will speak for Eisner’s position? They are conspicuously silent. How much money flowed to them while he was making all that money?</em></p>
