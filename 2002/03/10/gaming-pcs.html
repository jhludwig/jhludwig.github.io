<p><strong>Gaming PCs</strong>.</p>

<p>I am getting ready to start spec’ing out and building my next PC. I am starting to collect inspiration – the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/ComputersPeripherals/specials/AlienwareMain.asp">alienware site</a> has some cool machines but I fear I want more.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tech-junkie.com/">Tech Junkie</a> also seems like a great source of inspiration. Quit a few articles on overclocking the GeForce 4.</p>
