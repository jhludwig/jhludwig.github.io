<p><strong>CD Sharing Software</strong></p>

<p>One great use for a cheap NAS that <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/weblog/">Rich</a> has been talking about creating is to create a virtual CD Jukebox. I wonder how well <a href="http://www.mediapathtech.com/zdefault.htm">this software</a> works.</p>

<p>Update â€“ a better list of potential software up on <a href="http://www.download.com">download.com</a> when you search for virtual cd. <a href="http://www.farstone.com/home/en/html/productsvdn.htm">Virtualdrive</a> seems like an interesting commercial software option.</p>
