<p><strong>Audio Gear</strong> I am thinking about getting a <a href="http://www.prodcat.panasonic.com/shop/templates/square_template.asp?ModelId=13185&amp;show_all=false&amp;product_exists=True&amp;active=1&amp;ModelNo=SY-PA100">panasonic sy-pa100</a> personal pa system. Replaces about 3 pieces of gear I currently use to practice guitar with â€“ practice amp, drum machine, cd player. it is a little dorky looking but i think it could be cool. oh yeah it replaces a 4th piece of gear, my mixer.</p>
