<p><strong>Coins</strong> Iâ€™m getting hooked on ebay again. Not buying so much, as just watching the action. I purchased some SLC Olympic coinage from the <a href="http://catalog.usmint.gov/wcs/wcs_command/0,,cginame_a=CategoryDisplay&amp;querystring=cgnbr;4080+cgmenbr;1000+parentCategory;+nextCategory;+prevCategory;,00.html">US Mint</a>, and now I am watching all the <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;ht=1&amp;SortProperty=MetaEndSort&amp;query=olympic+coins">Olympic Coin auctions</a> on ebay. Lots of fun.</p>

<p>I used to collect coins as a kid and I still have the 76 Olympic Silver Dollar I bought up in Parry Sound that year. I guess I am kind of restarting my Olympic coin collection.</p>
