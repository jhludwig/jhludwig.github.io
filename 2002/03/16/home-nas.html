<p><strong>Home NAS</strong> I got my NAS installed last night. NAS == Network Attached Storage in case you weren’t aware. I used the Promise <a href="http://www.promise.com/product/subsys_detail_eng.asp?pid=13&amp;fid=4">ConnectStor</a> naked NAS chassis, with 2 <a href="http://www.wdc.com/products/products.asp?DriveID=12">Western Digital 120GB Drives</a>. I used a Raid 1 configuration, the default. So for under $1000, I have 120GB of fully redundant storage. I don’t need big whopping disk drives on my pcs anymore – not that the cost per pc is a big deal, but i am tired of forgetting what file is where. And I am tired of moving files from PC to PC when I upgrade. And of course I never backup so this gives me some improved reliability.</p>
