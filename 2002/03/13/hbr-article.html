<p><strong>HBR Article</strong></p>

<p>Good <a href="http://www.hbsp.harvard.edu/products/hbr/mar02/R0203E.html">article</a> on corporate social responsibility in the HBR this month. Unfortunately the web site wonâ€™t let you read it, you have to buy it or buy a copy of the mag. Worth reading tho.</p>
