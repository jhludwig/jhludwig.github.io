<p><strong>Fictional Characters</strong>. From NPR, the <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html">100 best of the last century</a>. I’m embarrassed about how few of these titles I have read. Equally impressive is <a href="http://www.imvumbu.com/books/Book%20Collection%2012-2001.htm">paul maritz’s book collection</a> -- i am embarrassed about my own massmarket reading habits.</p>
