<p><strong>Is that a web server in your pocket?</strong> From my buddy Adrian Smith – “Ahh, the pieces are coming together for my web-browsable doohickies - ? just saved me weeks of dev time ! <a href="http://www.siteplayer.com/">http://www.siteplayer.com/</a> Pretty neat little webserver on a 1? sq board for $30. Doesn?t run ASP scripts but you can poke variables into the web page it creates. Now need to find an 802.11 version !”</p>

<p>I want to bundle one of these with a battery and an 802.11 card so that I can carry my blog on my person as I walk around. Why? I don’t know, it just seems cool.</p>

<p>In the shorter term I guess I can just make my Pocket PC a <a href="http://www.newmad.se/software.asp">web server</a>…the toshiba <a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/pda/pda_home.html">e570</a> comes recommended as the best 802.11 pocketpc…</p>
