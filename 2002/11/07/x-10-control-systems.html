<p>OK I don’t really find X10 to be that appropriate for haunt automation. Too much latency in the gear, and too unreliable a protocol. The latency is the big problem. That said, there is a lot of product available and it is relatively inexpensive. You can find x10 and also higher end home automation here – <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/asihome/index.html">ASIhome</a>.
