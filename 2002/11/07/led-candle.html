<p>The October issue of Circuit Cellar magazine (a techy journal available at most bookstores) has an article on making an LED based candle that is powered by an Atmel AT90S8535. It even has a breeze sensor. You can download the code from Circuit Cellarâ€™s site. It sounds like the code is written in CodeVision AVR C.</p>
