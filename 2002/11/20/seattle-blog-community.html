<p><strong>Seattle Blog Community</strong>. Lots of interesting blogs up here – <a href="http://portal.eatonweb.com/state/Washington">eatonweb portal :: the original weblog directory</a>. I see there is an attempt to have a <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00000671.html">meet tonight</a>. Can’t do this one because of L’s birthday but will try to get to the next one. Or organize one.</p>
