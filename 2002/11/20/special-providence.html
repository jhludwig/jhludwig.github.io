<p><strong>Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How it Changed the World</strong>. I’m enjoying this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375412301/qid=1037941349/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7929887-9967955?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">book</a> and am just a chapter in. A good argument to start that the US has been far more active in foreign policy, and to far better effect, than we generally recognize. My favorite quote: <em>“The United States, on such a view, is the Mr. Magoo of the world community.”</em></p>
