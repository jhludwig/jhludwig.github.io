<p><strong>Blog Community Ethos</strong>. Wow something I love about the blog community is that anyone will respond to your email or comments. Truly friction free communication. Partly a function of the software, but more a function of the kind of people drawn to blogging – people I like. Also you are encouraged to put your thinking out for public view, which allows dialog, criticism, and refinement, and makes your thinking that much clearer. Kind of like the benefits of open source, applied to thinking.</p>

<p>As we approach Thanksgiving, I am thankful for the blog community – for the great communication, for the open sharing of ideas, for the experimentalism, for the risk taking.</p>
