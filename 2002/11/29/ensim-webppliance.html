<p><strong>Tong is interested in Ensim Webppliance.</strong> Hey Rich I am willing to consider running <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/weblog/2002_11_01_archive.asp#85239717">Webppliance</a> but does that mean you intend to move some domains back to my server? And what are the key features you want? I guess you are not having fun supporting Michelle, Zagula, etc, and want to automate the pain away? (Also PS your link to ensim is busted in this post)</p>
