<p><strong>Hunger at Thanksgiving</strong>. I heard from friends back in <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion,_Ohio">Marion</a> that 1000 free meals were served yesterday from just one church for the holiday. Multiply this by the number of active churches, organizations, shelters, etc, and that is a pretty phenomenal number of meals for a town with a population of 35,000, in a county with a population of 66,000.</p>

<p>It is saddening that so many people need help â€“ but I am glad there are so many people back in Marion who are helping out.</p>

<p>When I stopped at <a href="http://www.qfconline.com/">QFC</a> this am, i bought one of their pre-packaged bags of groceries for the food bank. Something I intend to do every trip to the market from now on.</p>
