<p><strong>Bluetooth pains.</strong> Comments from <a href="http://www.satn.org/archive/2002_11_10_archive.html#85668513">Bob Frankston</a> on Bluetooth. I have also heard that Bluetooth as a PAN is a bit problematic as it puts even more pressure on device batteries and puts even more hi-freq radiation near your skull. I wonder if this is true.</p>
