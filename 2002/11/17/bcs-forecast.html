<p><strong>BCS Forecast</strong>. Well here’s my guess on tomorrow’s BCS poll. OSU and Miami will easily stay 1-2 – no one else is in striking distance, OSU will pick up points despite their weak showing because a) margin of victory doesn’t count, and b) their strength of schedule will improve due to an additional game and Texas Tech’s defeat of Texas (remember, OSU beat Texas Tech the first game of the season).</p>

<p>The question is #3. WSU should easily hold its #3 position. The Texas loss will hurt Oklahoma in the standings as they will lose their -.6 quality win points. And no one else is even close to WSU. Iowa could move up a little but I don’t think much, they didn’t move up an extraordinary amount in the voted polls this am.</p>
