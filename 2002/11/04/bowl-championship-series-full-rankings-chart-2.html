<p><strong>BCS Rankings Nov 4</strong>. WHOO HOO! – <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/index.html">Bowl Championship Series - Full Rankings Chart</a>. Ohio State is #2!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>OK here is what needs to happen to guarantee we stay there:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ohio State has to win out.</li>
  <li>Va Tech needs to beat Miami. This would ice it.</li>
  <li>WSU needs to keep winning. They should but the UW game will be emotional.</li>
  <li>It wouldn’t hurt if OSU’s other opponents kept on winning – Michigan, Texas Tech, Penn State, etc. Keep that strength of schedule gap vs Miami.</li>
  <li>Oklahoma needs to keep playing tough and hopefully leapfrog Miami in the USA Today/ESPN poll.</li>
</ul>
