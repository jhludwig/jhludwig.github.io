<p><strong>Ohio State 14, Michigan 9</strong>. The Bucks find a way to win again. The defense gave up a lot of plays to Michigan, but no points in the second half. And the offense yet again did just enough to win. If Clarett was truly healthy, the Bucks might have dominated, but he did enough to help.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had email from my friend <a href="http://www.ignitionpartners.com/about/bill_m.asp">Bill</a> congratulating already, and a call from the relatives in Ohio. Woo Hoo!</p>
