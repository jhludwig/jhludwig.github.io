<p><strong>Xbox Live and 802.11a</strong>. I’m trying to figure out if this combo will work well. My xbox is in one of the few rooms in my house without a cat5 tap and so I want to use 802.11a to bridge the xbox onto the lan. I can find little info about this config on the net. Officially, Microsoft says it <a href="http://www.xbox.com/support/con-wireless.htm">won’t support wireless connections</a>. But on the <a href="http://forums.xbox.com">xbox forums</a>, many people have said they made it work. Many of them recommend the <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=432&amp;grid=22">Linksys WET11</a> bridge. I’ll probably try that.</p>
