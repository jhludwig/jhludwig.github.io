<p><strong>Fund a Blogger?</strong> <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> asked me in a <a href="http://radiocomments.userland.com/comments?u=1011&amp;p=1771&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0001011%2F2002%2F11%2F14.html%23a1771">comments</a> thread if we would ever fund a blogger. And the answer is “of course”. Both <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">Tong</a> and I are very high on blogs – the amount of energy and innovation around blogs is exciting! There are certainly going to be good businesses here somewhere. I don’t think we know what a good business in the blog space is yet, but we are certainly observing with interest and are happy to hear ideas.</p>
