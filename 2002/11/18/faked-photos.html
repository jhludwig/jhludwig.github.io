If a photo is presented as evidence at a trial, a good defense lawyer should be able to shred it unless there is amazing documentation on the photo’s history. I am not sure how you would prove that a photo is real. I am sure there are some artifacts at the pixel level left behind by most photo editors that a good forensic analyst could detect.
