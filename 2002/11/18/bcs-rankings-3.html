<p><strong>BCS Rankings</strong>. They are <a href="http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/index.html">out</a> and OSU does indeed slip to #2 – the professional prognosticators were right! I have to say it is pretty strange, given that victory margin is not considered, to play and win, and lose ground in the poll to an idle team. Whatever, it doesn’t matter, OSU just needs to focus on Michigan and all will be well.</p>
