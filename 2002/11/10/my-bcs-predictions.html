<p><strong>My BCS Predicts – 11/10</strong>. OK trying my hand at my own predictions, we’ll see how I do tomorrow versus the professional pundits. Based on what I know right now – the AP and ESPN polls, a few of the computer polls – I <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/CollegeFootball/BCS%20Components.htm">predict</a> OSU is still #1 tomorrow with 3.37 points, compared to Miami at 3.9. It is going to be very hard for Miami to overcome OSU’s quality win points from the WSU win.</p>
