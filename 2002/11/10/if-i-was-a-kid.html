<p><strong>If I was a kid</strong>. I’d want one of these for Christmas – <a href="http://www.zebrahall.com/z007-msf001.html">french sloop model boat</a> – I love any sort of boat model. And a <a href="http://www.discoverthis.com/chemistry.html">chemistry</a> set – tho in these days of extreme product safety the sets have been terribly neutered. When I was a kid I used to build models and promptly blow them up with firecrackers – combining these two great gifts into one merged orgy of creation and destruction. I am not really sure what this says about me but it is probably not good.</p>
