<p>We are an investor in <a href="http://www.idealab.com/">Idealab</a>, and boy have we learned hard lessons here. Our one really bad dotcom mistake. Bill Gross the founder is brilliant but things have not turned out well. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2001/nf20011221_2747.htm">Business Week</a> had an article on. And our lawsuit against the company is mentioned in <a href="http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&amp;doc_id=206543">Fortune</a> and in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0304/044a.html">Forbes</a> (sorry you have to register at Forbes to read the article).</p>

<p>This was the quickest investment decision I ever made and the worst. The connection is obviousâ€¦.</p>
