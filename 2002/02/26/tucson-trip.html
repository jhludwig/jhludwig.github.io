<p><strong>Tucson Trip</strong></p>

<p>We had a great trip down to Tucson and Scottsdale last week. It is our so-called “Mid Winter Break” or “Ski Week” – a week off from school in mid February. We get spring break later in April.</p>

<p>We had beautiful weather – approaching 80 each day, but cool at night. C and Liz stayed at <a href="http://www.canyonranch.com/tucson/index.asp">Canyon Ranch</a>, John and John at <a href="http://www.loewshotels.com/hotels/tucson/default.asp">Loew’s Ventana Canyon Resort</a>. Canyon Ranch is awesome, “camp for grownups”, but they have an age limit of 14 so we can’t all go there yet.</p>

<p>While the girls were spa-ing, John and John hit all the tourist attractions in Tucson including <a href="http://www.oldtucson.com/">Old Tucson Studios</a> -- fun old west stunt shows, a real hoot.</p>

<p>Everyone is back in school and or work today, 6 weeks to spring break!</p>
