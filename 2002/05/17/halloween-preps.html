<p><strong>Halloween Preps</strong>. After much deliberation I’ve settled on my projects for this year. I am a) going to beef up my lightning primarily by switching to blue photo floodlights as discussed on <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html">my halloween blog</a>. B) I am going to try my hand at a small axworthy ghost project, drawing inspiration from some of the more <a href="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/urmyslav/page1.html?mtbrand=AOL_US"></a>extreme setups out there. I’ve tracked down a motor and am going to start laying out all the gear i need this weekend. c) i am going to build a small <a href="http://members.accesstoledo.com/kkrazykkaren/Floating/Lantern.html">flying lantern</a> setup. i’ve also gotten my cheap mirror ball motor for this and am going to start getting the rest of the gear this weekend.</p>

<p>There are some minor other things I want to do but these are the longer leadtime items. I’ll try to post pictures as I make progress.</p>
