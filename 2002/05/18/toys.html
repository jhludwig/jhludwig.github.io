<p><strong>Toys</strong>. Need to try out <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/main.html">Adobe Illustrator</a>, havenâ€™t looked at in years. Also recommended is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopel/main.html">Photoshop Elements</a> for digital photo munging. And <a href="http://www.moodlogic.net/">moodlogic.net</a> looks like a great way to use my CD collection.</p>
