<p><strong>Drive imaging</strong>. I’ve suffered thru several recent system failures and have had to reinstall Windows+Apps which has been no fun. Time to start imaging my hard drives. Norton ghost is the obvious choice and i am also trialing <a href="http://www.powerquest.com/driveimage/didetails.cfm">PowerQuest: Drive Image 2002</a>. So far I don’t love either one of them. I want to back up to my NAS and they are more geared to CD backup.</p>
