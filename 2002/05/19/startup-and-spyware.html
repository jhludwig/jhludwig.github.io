<p><strong>Startup and Spyware</strong>. A bunch of utilities that purport to tell you what goo is running in the background on your system, most from recent print pcmag.</p>

<p>I tried both <a href="http://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/AutoStartManager.htm">AutoStartManager</a> and <a href="http://www.startupmgr.com/">StartUp Manager</a>. Pretty bare bones – they tell you what processes are running, and startup manager lets you disable startup processes. But not a lot of detail on what the processes do. Or on traffic they generate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.agnitum.com/products/tauscan/">Tauscan</a> is another tool. Focused primarily on finding hidden trojan horse processes. Has an impressive db of potential trojans it looks for. It seemed to work OK, tho didn’t find any real problems with my system (good).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.safersite.com/">PestPatrol</a> is the last I hope to try…</p>
