<p><strong>Axworthy ghost status</strong>. Making good progress on this. I have a small motor – an appliance fan motor. May be too fast and too low torque but am going to try it. I’ve got my drive wheel – an old lawnmower wheel to mount on the motor. I’ve got my carriage wheels – wheelbarrow wheels. I’ve got my carriage line – 100 lb test fishing line. Doing a lot of parts prep and assembly this week, I hope to have a limping system this weekend.
