<p><strong>Memorial Day Weekend</strong>. We picked up some kayaks and a canoe this week and are having a blast tooling around the lake. Weather is marginal but as long as it is not pouring we are having some fun. We got our boats at <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI’s</a> big annual sale – man I am a sucker for REI.</p>

<p>OK so it’s not really boating unless someone ends up in the water. I drew the short straw this outing. As C exited the canoe at the end of the ride, the canoe destabilized and whoop! in I went. Lake Washington is cold in May but not unbearable. I think I’ll get out of the canoe first next time…</p>

<p>We need a way to store the boats on the dock during the summer. This seems to be the cadillac of storage systems – <a href="http://www.talic.com/intro.htm">Talic</a> – doesn’t look too weather safe tho.</p>

<p>The racks at <a href="http://www.seitech.com/trailerstorageracks.htm#Storage Racks">SEITECH</a> look a little more weather safe. We’re going to cruise the shore today and see what others do for storage.</p>
