<p><strong>BlogAmp</strong>. Check out my playlist down a ways on the left – dynamically updating thanks to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/insanitydrops/blogamp/en/index.html">blogamp</a>. Cool toy. I wish it was easy to auto-publish other items like this – my favorite ebay searches, my recent book purchases, whatever. Needs a thoughtful security/privacy model as I may not wish all of this to be easily published. But there is something interesting here.</p>
