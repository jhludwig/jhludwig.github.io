<p><strong>Your Tax Dollars at Work</strong>. The Ohio State Legislature, after 200 years of statehood, is finally rectifying an <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=124_SB_264">obvious oversight</a> – choosing a state amphibian. Thank goodness. It can join now the state beverage – tomato juice – and the state fossil – trilobite – and the many other fine symbols of Ohio.</p>

<p>Here in Washington we are <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/legis/symbols/symbols.htm">waaaay behind</a> – we have a state insect, fish, fossil, tree, but no amphibian. Are slugs amphibians? They’d get my vote.</p>
