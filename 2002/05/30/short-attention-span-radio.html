<p><strong>Short Attention Span Radio</strong>. Tune to 95.7 here in the seattle market. the home of <a href="http://www.quick96.com/">quick 96</a>. sub-10 second snippets of songs, one after another, with a numerical tag announced for each. The most bizarre radio experience I have ever had.</p>

<p>Update: went off the air as fast as it came on. Replaced by KJR FM. a) I am sure this was all driven by economics I don’t have visibility into. b) Man does this tell me that the way we allocate spectrum is nuts – here is a piece of valuable spectrum that is being wasted away just because it is in the middle of the long-established FM band.</p>
