<p><strong>Seattle Area Blogger – Sonics Game Friday 12/20</strong>. Hey Seattle area bloggers, I have 1 spare ticket for the Sonics game friday night, and it’d be fun to meet someone in person and chat. Send me a note at the ignitionpartners address if you’d like to meet me at the game. Good opponent (hornets), great seats, and we can chat about blogs.</p>
