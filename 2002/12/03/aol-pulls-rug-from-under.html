<p><strong>AOL pulls rug from under ‘Magic Carpet”.</strong> AOL has <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article.php3?sid=1038832383">disbanded the Magic Carpet</a> team. Is anyone really surprised? The history of industry consortiums that have come together with the sole purpose of countering some Microsoft initiative is not good. I remember viewing these consortiums with amusement because the members were never truly aligned on goals, they just all wanted to join in a Microsoft hate-fest, and that never leads to a viable software product. And it just wastes the time and energy of these companies.</p>
