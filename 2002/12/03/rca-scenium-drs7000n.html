<p><strong>RCA Scenium DRS7000N</strong>. Judging by my referrals, a lot of people are interested in this <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2002_10_01_archive.html#85625710">DVD/PVR combo</a>. I happen to have it on good authority that I am getting one for Christmas, I’ll post a review up here as soon as I get it. Hey if you post enough comments, maybe you can convince C to give it to me early, so that I can post a review faster…</p>
