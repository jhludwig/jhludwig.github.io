<p><strong>TiVo posting to blog</strong>. I am very jealous of <a href="http://www.hitormiss.org/tivo/">Matt’s work</a> to post his TiVo use to his blog. I am very scared to hack into my TiVo tho because it is the most “mission critical” box in the house – the family will flip out if it quits working. I really want a way to suck the data out without having to crack the case.</p>
