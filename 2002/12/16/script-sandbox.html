<p><strong>Script Sandbox.</strong> I really need some sort of sandbox for my server scripts. Some environment that I can run PHP/Perl/etc scripts in for a month or so before I let them have full access to my system. Some way to carefully track their disk usage, net usage for errors and for deviant behaviour. I need to start searching for such a thing.</p>
