<p><strong>SIIG USB2/1394 card</strong>. Installed this yesterday – <a href="http://www.siig.com/products/usb/features/USB2_1394DVKit.html">USB 2.0+1394 DV Kit</a>. Smooth as butter under XP. Auto recognized, used all the standard XP drivers, didn’t have to deal with any driver cds or other goo. Very very painless.</p>
