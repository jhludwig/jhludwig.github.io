<p><strong>Video XB</strong>. Installed <a href="http://www.videoxb.com/">Video xb - Capture, Edit, Author and Burn professional style DVDâ€™s</a> (after getting my 1394 port installed below). Also smooth as butter! both the dvd and hard drive were automagically recognized by XP, again no funky third party drivers required. Very nice.</p>
