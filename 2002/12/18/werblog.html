<p><strong>Blog Backup</strong>. Why I continue to stick with blogger – <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/2002/12/18.html">WERBLOG – Back from the Dead</a>. With blogger I get a little disaster recovery capability – if my server explodes tomorrow, the content is up in blogger servers, and if blogger goes toes up tomorrow, the content is on my server. If i move to MT or Radio, then I have to take on a backup burden too, and experience has shown that I suck at backup (like many people).</p>
