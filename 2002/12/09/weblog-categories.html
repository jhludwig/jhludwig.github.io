<p><strong>Categories</strong>. <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/12/09.html#a533">Jon Udell’s</a> struggle with categories on his blog. I am not a big fan of categories because I believe that a) people don’t take the time to tag all their content appropriately, and b) our sense of proper categorization changes over time creating a management/mapping headache. I am much more interested in adding a great search interface to my site with really good and adaptive stemming support as the way to find all articles on a topic.</p>
