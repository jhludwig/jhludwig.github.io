<p><strong>Samsung Uproar Phone.</strong> Grr. I bought this phone a couple years ago because of the included mp3 player. i haven’t used it much in the last year but i dusted it off and started using again. I wanted to load new music on it of course. A, the old software doesn’t work under XP. B, Sprint doesn’t support the phone anymore and there is no XP software on their site. C, Samsung doesn’t support the phone anymore and there is no XP software on their site. So I now have a phone that has a set of music, for all intents and purposes, welded into the phone for all time. After being introduced just a couple years ago.</p>

<p>Reinforces my determination to NEVER buy a device again that doesn’t support simple open formats and protocols. Vendors don’t maintain their proprietary crap and then you are stuck.</p>
