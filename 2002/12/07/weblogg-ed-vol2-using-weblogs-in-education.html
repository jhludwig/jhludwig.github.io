<p><strong>Weblogs for the Rest of Us</strong>. Trying to get most of the <a href="http://www.weblogg-ed.com/2002/12/05">teaching staff to use weblogs</a> appears to be a trial. I think the comment that “it is easier to use email than a blog” is very important – if we want to rope in every user in our organizations, we need to get weblog use as easy as email.</p>

<p>There is a lot of inertia to email – people stare at their inboxes all day and use that email editor all day. We need a plugin for our email products that just posts cleanly to a blog from the new message form. maybe you can just type in blog name in the TO: box.</p>

<p>And a plugin that lets you see responses and new blog items right in the email app, maybe right in your inbox.</p>
