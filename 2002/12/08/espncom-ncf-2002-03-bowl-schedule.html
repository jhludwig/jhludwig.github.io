<p><strong>Bowl Schedule</strong>. <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2002-03_bowls.html">ESPN.com: NCF - 2002-03 Bowl schedule</a> – the Rose, Orange, and Fiesta all seem pretty interesting. Sugar Bowl is too regional to really have much buzz. I am also interested in the Outback Bowl – Michigan vs Florida, two great programs. Virginia vs WVU in the Continental Tire Bowl seems like a fun matchup. The Seattle Bowl sounds like a snoozer – just no heat between Oregon and Wake Forest.</p>
