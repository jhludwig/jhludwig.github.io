<p><strong>URL Remapping under IIS</strong>. OK I am finding all the tools for this. <a href="http://www.streamcatcher.com/index.htm">www.streamcatcher.com StreamCatcher</a> seems like a complete and supported product. The <a href="http://www.newobjects.com/product.asp?Category=46&amp;">ISAPI URL Remapper</a> is a lot cheaper but also seems more limited. There is also a tool from a company called ZmeY whose website seems a little confusing.</p>
