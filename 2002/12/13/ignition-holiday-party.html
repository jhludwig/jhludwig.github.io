<p><strong>Ignition Holiday Party</strong>. A nice evening last nite, it was great to see everyone out of the office and with their families. Thanks Jon and Elizabeth for hosting. Hoops won the hand-made sock contest with his “Ghost of Christmas Past” socks, Deneen won in the store-bought division. I had a lot of great ideas for socks but no time to execute – the story of my life :)</p>
