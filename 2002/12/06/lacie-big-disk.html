<p><strong>LaCie Big Disk</strong>. My 120G NAS is filling up – this might be the way to go – <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.cfm?id=D9D5898F-01A6-11D7-98250090278D3ED0">LaCie Big Disk</a>. I’m a little worried about speed though. I guess it will be no slower than my NAS over GBenet.</p>
