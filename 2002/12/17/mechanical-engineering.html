<p><strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong>. A compendium of the ways to <a href="http://www.flying-pig.co.uk/Pages/mechindex.htm">translate rotational motion into linear motion</a>. Super helpful for Halloween. I need the similar compendium now for converting motion in one direction into motion in another direction, and multiplication of motion.</p>
