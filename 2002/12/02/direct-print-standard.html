<p><strong>Direct Print Standard</strong>. If <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-975696.html">this</a> is done right, maybe this would let us get rid of print drivers altogether? If every printer understands the DPS standard, and it is rich enough to handle arbitrary page printing, can we get rid of the need to install printer drivers altogether? I hate the fact that every HP printer comes with 10M+ of goofy software, most of which is not very helpful.</p>
