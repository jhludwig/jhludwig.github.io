<p><strong>GB Ethernet</strong>. After a night of trying to move captured video files around, I am ready to sign up for gigabit ethernet. At least one site recommends the <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,661881,00.asp">dlink product line</a> – i hope they have a switch with more than 4 ports. Surprising little discussion of gigabit ethernet on the enthusiast sites based on my quick scan – for instance i found nothing on tom’s hardware. are people really not playing around with this in the home?</p>
