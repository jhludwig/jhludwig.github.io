<p><strong>FTP Clients for XP</strong>. I have been limping along using the native support in XP for FTP but I am ready to buy something. The shell support in XP seems so flakey, particularly when I have a couple FTP windows open. I need something that lets me have a couple windows open, sometimes pointed at the same FTP site but different directories. With an explorer view. <a href="http://www.download.com">Download.com</a> data suggests WS_FTP or SmartFTP.</p>

<p><strong>WS_FTP, FTPx</strong> – just installed WS_FTP. It seems robust but doesn’t really provide the explorer view I need – it doesn’t help me copy files from one FTP site to another for instance. <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/">Anita</a> recommended <a href="http://www.ftpx.com">FTPX</a> and I just downloaded and tried this. MUCH better. the tree interface is nice. still doesn’t seem to fully permit drag and drop between two FTP windows but I suspect I can live with.</p>

<p><strong>SmartFTP</strong>. Finally tried this. Wow this one I really like. Very robust tree operations, very easy to drag/drop files across FTP folders. The best of the bunch so far.</p>
