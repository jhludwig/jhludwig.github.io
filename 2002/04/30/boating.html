<p><strong>Boating</strong>. The great weather makes me want to get out on a boat. And we live in a great area for it. Thankfully there is no reason to actually own a boat. There is a great market of charter options. We’ve used <a href="http://ledgermarinecharters.com/main.htm">Ledger Marine</a> here in Seattle and had great luck. Other options I’ve noticed are <a href="http://www.penmar.com/crewed.htm">Penmar</a>, <a href="http://www.cnconnect.com/charter.html">CNI Charters</a>, <a href="http://www.bellinghamyachts.com/bys/bys_5.html">Bellingham Yacht Sales</a>, <a href="http://www.abcyachtcharters.com/">ABC</a>, <a href="http://www.starellit.com/fleet.htm">Starellit</a>, and <a href="http://www.gulfislandcharter.com/">Anacortes Yacht Charters</a>. A huge range of pricing, amenities, crew options, etc. Waaaay cheaper than actually owning a boat.</p>

<p>Someday I’d like to do a charter in other parts of the world. From some of these sites you can see the market for charters in other areas, and clearly the mediterranean and caribean are active markets. I have a dream of doing Australia by boat someday…</p>
