<p><strong>Whitewater</strong>. Time to book those summer trips now. <a href="http://www.riverexpeditions.com/">North Cascades River Expeditions</a> and <a href="http://www.riverrider.com/index.html">River Riders</a> have worked for us in the past. The Tieton and Wenatchee runs were the most fun. The Nooksack and Suiattle are beautiful but can be a bit cold and damp.</p>
