<p><strong>My site Architecture</strong>. Starting to think about the next iteration of my site architecture. The current site is just blogger driven+some minor template mods. There are a lot of things I want to do tho that I am not getting from this architecture â€“ a good search interface, a good URL command line interface, categories, private password-protected posts, server-side aggregation of various feeds, complete separation of content from template. <a href="http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/">Bloxsom</a> is an interesting alternative, and of course I have already paid for Radio.</p>
