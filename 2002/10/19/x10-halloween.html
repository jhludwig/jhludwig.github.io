<p><strong>X10 Halloween</strong>. Deep in the throes of getting all my x10 setup debugged for halloween. Man x10 just sucks. The gear is fragile, all kinds of mysterious communication problems, the software sucks. I hate it. But it is cheap and widely available.</p>

<p>I am close to dumping the gui software I use and just write some scripts. I see that there is Perl support available <a href="http://members.aol.com/Bbirthisel/x10.d/">here</a>. And a web interface on top of perl support at <a href="http://www.homeautomationzone.com/x10-web.shtml">X10 Web Control</a>.</p>

<p>Next year tho I may just pick up a few more dmx dimmers and do away with x10 altogether. I donâ€™t see anything on the web abour perl/python interfaces to dmx tho.</p>

<p>Maybe next year I should be an early adopter of uPNP or some such crazy scheme.</p>
