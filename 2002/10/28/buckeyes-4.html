<p><strong>Buckeyes.</strong> Nerve wracking win on Saturday but a win is a win. The computer polls don’t care about margin of victory tho clearly the voters do as OSU dropped two spots in the AP Poll. We need some help tho…very disappointing to watch FSU collapse against Notre Dame. Tho the vaunted Notre Dame schedule doesn’t seem so tough now as Michigan lost against, Michigan State has collapsed, Air Force lost again, and of course FSU is having an off year.</p>
