<p><strong>SlickEdit.</strong> As I get into more coding work I am going to have to pick up a good editor. Used to use <a href="http://www.slickedit.com/index.html">SlickEdit</a> and will probably try that again. At $299 it is a lot more expensive than it used to be tho…does the Visual Studio editor deal well with non-MSFT languages like PERL and PHP? Oh I see that ActiveState has a Visual Perl plug in for Visual Studio…that costs $295. I guess $300 is price to play…need to look around for some lower cost alternatives. Where is Borland when we need them…</p>
