<p><strong>Rats</strong>. One of my Halloween displays will be a cage of rats. The cage door will rattle every once in a while and a little burst of fog will come out of the central den. There will be a sign above the den – “Ben” – referring back to the movie Willard I saw as a kid. Amazingly I find they are doing a <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;cf=prev&amp;id=1808406589&amp;intl=us">remake of Willard</a>. I still remember the night I saw it first – at a drive-in – a triple feature – I forget the first show – then came Willard – followed by some creepy Dr Phibes movie. My sister and I were wrapped up in blankets in the back of the station wagon watching. I am pretty sure I fell asleep part way thru Willard. But it obviously left an impression on me, I remember the night well. Drive-ins are a lost treasure.</p>

<p>Anyway back to the display. I’ll have a creepy squealing sound coming from the cage too. I tried various rodent squeals but they are too high pitched to be creepy and loud – all the energy gets dissipated as high frequency, not enough volume or rumble. A pig squeal comes out great tho.</p>
