<p><strong>Expensing Options</strong>. Reading <a href="http://www.tapsns.com">SNS</a> this week, it just struck me that, rather than trying to assign some debateable value number to options and passing them thru the P&amp;L, let’s do a simpler thing. Let’s just have companies publish quarterly a statement of ownership – who owns what shares; how many new options were granted in the quarter; how many grants expired or were cancelled; new stock issuances as a result of financing moves, etc. And then a clear state of EPS impacts of all this – I just want to know, as a stockholder, did I suffer unfair and unwise dilution during the quarter? This is something that companies could do today without solving the problem of how to value options. And it would be valuable.</p>
