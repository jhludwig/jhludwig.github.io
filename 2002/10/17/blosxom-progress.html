<p><strong>Blosxom progress</strong>. OK I have now also fixed the scripts to deal with the differences between Win2k/IIS and Unix/Apache handling of path elements after the blosxom.cgi reference in the URL. I can find no way to make Win2k/IIS treat this as a path_info argument to a perl script, so i have changed the script to make “?topic=foo” work as the argument to get a specific content blog – e.g. <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/halloween?topic=props">www.theludwigs.com/halloween?topic=props</a>. Which meant i had to patch up the links that blosxom creates for permalinks, etc. I am pretty sure archive viewing doesn’t work quite right yet tho i am not sure I care since I don’t have an archive for my halloween blog. Also haven’t looked at the RSS output yet.</p>
