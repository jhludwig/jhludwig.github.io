<p><strong>Halloween Status</strong>. Got the big fogger system working this weekend – now I can flood our yard and the street and the neighbor’s yard with fog. All the big props in place. All power and <a href="http://www.usitt.org/DMX/DMX512.htm">DMX</a> control cables in place. Next big work items – deployment of small props, deployment of x10 control for small electrics, testing of all the above.</p>
