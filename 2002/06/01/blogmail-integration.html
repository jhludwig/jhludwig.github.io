<p><strong>Blog/Mail Integration</strong>. I like the ideas <a href="http://vaporware.blogspot.com/">Jon Davis</a> is working on. What I really want is a blog frontend plugged right into Outlook or Outlook Express. I spend 80% of my day in these tools, they have UI constructs for editting, filing, posting, etc. Why do I need a new tool to do these things? Similarly I want RSS news aggregation built into these so I can review new headlines the same way I review new mail.</p>
