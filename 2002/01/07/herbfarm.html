<p><strong>Herbfarm</strong></p>

<p>This coming Friday night C and I are going to dinner at the <a href="http://www.herbfarm.com/">Herbfarm</a>, the most famous restaurant in the Pacific Northwest. We bought the dinner at a school auction. You typically have to reserve a year in advance. Very French with a lot of snooty wine and stinky cheese and strange animals and parts of animals. Wish us luck.</p>

<p>Ooh I see this weekend they are featuring truffles. This is much preferable to sweetbreads or gosh knows what else.</p>
