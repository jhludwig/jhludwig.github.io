<p><strong>Back to the Grind</strong></p>

<p>Both L and J back to school today. A tough morning, everyone up and moving by 620 am. 6 weeks of grind until mid-winter break in february. That’s not so bad. We’re going to Arizona for a week in February so we have something to look forward to.</p>

<p>Raining raining raining today. As it was yesterday. Why we hate Seattle. But on the good side of the ledger, the daffodil shoots all broke thru in the last 4-5 days, so spring is already on its way!</p>

<p><strong>College Update</strong></p>

<p>Another school L is now considering is <a href="http://www.oxy.edu/">Occidental</a> in LA. She met a student from her high school who now goes there and loves it. And per the website, Oxy is ‘Hot’, according to <a href="http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/611721.asp">Newsweek</a> and the WSJ.</p>

<p>C and I are trying to figure out why “Oxy” is the abbreviation for “Occidental”.</p>
