<p>Here’s what I’d like to see:</p>

<p>* <em>Start Me Up</em> by the Rolling Stones from Tattoo You LP * <em>Tattoo</em> by Jordin Sparks * <em>I Don’t Want To Set The World On Fire</em> by The Ink Spots * <em>Dancing With Myself</em> by Billy Idol, themesong from LA Ink * <em>Last Tattoo</em> by Rehab</p>

<p>If our band was the Stanford band, you know this would happen. But then our band would suck.</p>
