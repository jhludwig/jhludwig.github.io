All the new dock and breakwater components are on site. Pilings going in now. Over the next several weeks it will all hopefully be put back into place and we will have a new totally compliant dock, should last another 40 years or so.</p>

<p>The entire process of permitting and approval has been a total clusterâ€¦ goat rodeo long exercise in patience. Glad we are done.</p>
