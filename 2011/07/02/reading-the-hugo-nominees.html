<p>I’ve plowed thru much of the Hugo nominees in the last couple weeks, thanks to the <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2011/05/hugo-awards-nominees-in-ebook-form/">great deal to get them all in ebook form</a>.</p>

<p>* Novels: “Cryoburn”:amazon by Lois M. Bujold. At first I thought, well, this story has been written before. But ended up feeling like very compelling. “Blackout”:amazon by Connie Willis. Eh. Gave up. Vaguely ridiculous plotting. “Feed”:amazon by Mira Grant. Read this earlier in the year, it is a great tide. My vote. Still two more to read tho.</p>

<p>* Novellas: <em>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</em> by Ted Chiang. Interesting speculation on the maturation of artificially intelligent programs, a little mechanistic but interesting. <em>The Lady Who Plucked Red Flowers Beneath the Queen’s Window</em> by Rachel Swirsky. A nearly immortal sorceress thru the ages, good but not great. <em>The Maiden Flight of McCauley’s Bellerophon</em> by Elizabeth Hand. Fanciful, touching, not really my taste. <em>Troika</em> by Alistair Reynolds. Russians exploring a uniquely russian alien spacecraft, yawn. <em>The Sultan of the Clouds</em> by Geoffrey A. Landis. Very nice tale of a far future Venus, where the atmosphere is settled by humans. I like the Landis tale.</p>

<p>* Novelette: <em>Eight Miles</em> by Sean McMullen. Steampunk, an exiled martian and balloonist partner up. <em>The Emperor of Mars</em> by Allen M. Steele. A touching story of a Mars colonist dealing with incredible grief. <em>The jaguar House in Shadow</em> by Aliette de Bodard. Intrigue in a modern day Aztec empire. Nice atmosphere, would love to read more. <em>That Leviathan, Whom Thou Hast Made</em> by Eric James Stone. A Mormon missionary in the sun, reaching out to plasma beings – original. <em>Plus or minus</em> by James Patrick Kelly. Disaster strikes a cargo hauler on way from asteroids, some quality characters. Both the de Bodard and Stone stories are memorable.</p>

<p>* Short Stories: <em>Amaryllis</em> by Carrie Vaughn. Life on a resource-constrained world. Lots of characterization in a short story, could certainly support a longer tale. <em>Ponies</em> by Kij Johnson. Wow, super nasty dark story about kids and cliques. <em>The Things</em> by Peter Watts. The thing, told from its perspective – Nicely done. I really like the Watts story</p>
