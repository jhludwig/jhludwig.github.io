<p>I love the fact that my Beats earbuds never tangle in my pocket due to their ribbon cable design. Ok they tangle a little but like one millionth the tangle frustration of typical buds.</p>

<p>But dammit, the in-ear gel plugs pop off constantly and get lost.</p>

<p>Speculation: the tangling of the cord actually protects and secures the removable gel plugs. Mathematicians, get on this one. (Or alternatively - the gel plugs actually attract the cable and encourage tangling, this seems less likely.)</p>

<p>And if so, then earbuds actually conform to a universal law. The sum of tangle frustration and lost plug frustration is constant. The greater the tangling, the less likely you are to lose the plugs. The more plugs you lose, the less tangling you get.</p>
