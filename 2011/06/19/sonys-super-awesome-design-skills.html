<p>Insert Disneynature Ocean Blu-Ray disc into PS3. “Oh your Blu-Ray player encryption keys are out of date, you must download an update”.</p>

<p>Spend 5 minutes wandering through obtuse PS3 menus to find the system update choice, “Oh your network connection isn’t working”.</p>

<p>Spend more time figuring out where and how to config the PS3 wireless connection.</p>

<p>Download the update, reboot the PS3, and bam all my bluetooth PS3 controllers quit working. Go find the right USB cable and remember how to plug in a PS3 controller.</p>

<p>Complete the update. Thankfully bluetooth controllers come back to life and disc now plays.</p>

<p>20 minutes, incredibly obtuse messages, just to play a movie. What do regular humans do? Obviously they don’t play Blu-Ray discs in PS3s.</p>
