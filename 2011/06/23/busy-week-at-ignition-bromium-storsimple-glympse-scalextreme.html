<p>I’ve fallen out of the habit of talking about Ignition portfolio news up here, but it has been a busy week and I am re-motivated to talk about some of these companies.</p>

<p>* “Bromium”:http://vator.tv/news/2011-06-22-bromium-gets-92m-to-make-the-cloud-more-secure has a great team and working in an exciting spacen – the intersection of security, cloud computing, and virtualization. I am very interested to see how this team evolves, I can personally see myself using their technology. * Continuing in the cloud space, “ScaleExtreme”:http://www.scalextreme.com/ is making it really simple to manage all your servers in the cloud, I am also excited to try this out. And check out the super sweet “pic of Frank”:http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/062111_ScaleXtreme_Closes_11_Million_Funding_Round_Names_Board_Member in this press piece! * “StorSimple”:http://www.storsimple.com/press-releases/bid/59821/Latest-Funding-Establishes-StorSimple-as-the-Safe-Bet-in-Enterprise-Cloud-Storage integrates enterprise storage with the cloud, giving the benefits of local storage performance and cloud backup/archiving/tiered storage. Probably not something I can ever personally use, but a great space to be in. * In a whole different direction, “Glympse”:http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/glympse-raises-75-million-to-help-you-share-your-location-a-few-hours-at-a-time/2011/06/22/AGfztafH_story.html lets you share your location with friends and family. I’m not a big public checkin user (foursquare, etc), but keeping family and close friends up to date with my location is a lot more compelling to me. Great team and a nice intersection of our software and mobile investment biases.</p>
