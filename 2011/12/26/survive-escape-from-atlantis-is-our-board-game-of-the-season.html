<p>We always pick up a new board game at the holidays, in the past Settlers of Cataan and Ticket to Ride have been huge winners. This year it is “Survive”:http://www.amazon.com/Stronghold-Games-PSISG2002-Survive-Atlantis/dp/B004LEJCM8/ref=pd_sim_t_1 which is a great game – super easy to learn, quick to play, and a great level of conflict. It has the Settlers attribute of a new board layout each game which keeps it fresh. If you like board games, recommended. If you were raised in the USA and think board games == Monopoly (barf), give one of these a try.</p>
