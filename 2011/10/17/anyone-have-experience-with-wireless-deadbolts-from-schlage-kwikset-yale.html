<p><a href="http://www.gokeyless.com/product/720/2/schlage-be365ply613-keypad-deadbolt-lock"><img src="images/b55cf51a3945b850d8351555b30d6da9.jpg" alt="" title="Deadbolt" /></a>Iâ€™m going to try out a wireless deadbolt so that I can remotely manage and track access to a location. There are offerings from Yale (for instance <a href="http://www.yaleresidential.com/en/yale/yale-USA/Real-Living/product-details/Keypad/Keypad1/">this Yale deadbolt</a>), Schlage (<a href="http://link.schlage.com/Products/Pages/DeadboltStarterKit.aspx">this deadbolt</a>), and Kwikset. I am trying to understand the pricing and features of their remote access choices. Schlage seems to want $8.99 a month for remote access which makes me unhappy. The Yale product works with a <a href="http://www.gokeyless.com/product/748/5/micasaverde-vera2-zwave-home-automation-system">Vera2 controller</a> and seems to offer free monthly basic services, tho it seems like this controller might work with the Schlage as well?</p>

<p>Anybody have a positive or negative experience with any of these? I also wonder a lot about security of course, worried about creating a huge risky backdoor into the location.</p>
