<p>I don’t need or want any of this stuff actually but am drawn to all of it…</p>

<p>* “Car map light”:http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20100526/flexible-map-light/. Ok who looks at maps anymore, but this is nicely designed! * “Multimeter Clock”:http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2010/06/24/multimeter-clock-styled-after-the-simpson-260-multimeter/. Love the reuse of old tech here. Wish I had the skill/vision to create things like this. * “Carol Kipling Plates”:https://www.carolkipling.com/product/Gogi%20Seeds%20Glass%20Platter. Love the platter but $2800 is steep… * “14 wheel skateboard”:http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/07/26/the-flowlab-14-wheel-skateboard-can-it-possibly-work/ so I can suck at skateboarding 3.5 times as much. * “Tourbillon vase”:http://www.coolhunting.com/tech/tourbillon.php – awesome organic-looking glass. * “Urban Balance Wave Hammock”:http://www.allmodern.com/Outback-Chair-Company-UBC6XX-OCC1014.html?SSAID=276135&amp;refid=SS276135 – can this possibly be stable? But cool. * “Designer Scrabble”:http://design-milk.com/designer-scrabble-by-andrew-clifford-capener/ I love board games and I love nicely crafted items. I have a great cribbage board, would love to buy great boards for other games – Catan, TIcket to Ride, etc. * “LaserPegs”:http://www.laserpegs.com/. Lasers make everything better, including construction blocks. * “Freesia Book Stands”:http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/004652.php – these look awesome, seems like a great item to have. * “Chemically Accurate Crayons”:http://www.etsy.com/shop/QueInteresante?ref=seller_info. OK these are just labels you stick on crayons you buy, so kind of dorky, but I love the idea. “Could you please pass me the Yttrium Oxide crayon”?</p>
