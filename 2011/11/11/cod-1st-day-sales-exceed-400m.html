<p>“Call of Duty: Modern Warfare sets first day sales record”:http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2011/11/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-sets-first-day-sales-record/1. What stunning numbers. I don’t think “Skyrim”:http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gamehunters/post/2011/11/review-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-a-magnificent-odyssey/1 will do the same but a huge week for online entertainment. There is clearly huge demand for great entertainment content, pretty much insatiable demand. And why not, these games give hours and hours of entertainment, the per-hour price is super low.</p>
