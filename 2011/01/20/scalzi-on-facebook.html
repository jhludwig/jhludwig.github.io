<p>Scalzi has some <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2011/01/19/contest-update-and-facebook-followup/">thoughtful criticism</a> <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2011/01/19/and-now-for-no-particular-reason-a-rant-about-facebook/">of Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>For me, Facebook isnâ€™t bad, it is just boring. For all the things I do online there are experiences and sites which are so much more engaging. Twitter for late breaking tech and sports news and snark around them; sports sites and sports blogs for college football; immersive games for entertainment (have you tried Minecraft? or Steam best sellers?); photography and electronics sites for gear reviews; and so on. Occasionally I get some useful extended family pictures from Facebook but no great pictures. There is just no great reason to go to Facebook that often.</p>

<p>The movie was entertaining though.</p>
