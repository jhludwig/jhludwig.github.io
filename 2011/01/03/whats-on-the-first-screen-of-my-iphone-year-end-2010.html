<p>I’ve made a number of changes on the first page of my iphone since “last survey”:http://theludwigs.com/2010/08/whats-on-the-first-screen-of-my-iphone-august-2010/.</p>

<p>Firstly, the bottom row: Mail, Messages, Safari, and Calvetica in place of the Apple Calendar app. Calvetica doesn’t offer a lot more features but has a pleasing look. I’m not sure I will stick with it but worth a try. But I use all these apps constantly so they all deserve bottom row status.</p>

<p>The rest of the first page then, a set of communications apps:</p>

<p>* The Apple Phone app for voice and voicemail. * The GroupMe app for group texting. Actually I have been bouncing this position between GroupMe for group texting and Google Voice for wifi texting. And I still have the Messages app in the bottom row. I would really love one app that did texting, group texting, and on either wifi or carrier networks.</p>

<p>A set of cloud apps:</p>

<p>* Evernote. For text and increasingly for photos. In fact I have pretty much relegated the standard iPad camera app to the dustbin, by using Evernote for photos, they are dumped into the cloud immediately. Handy. * Dropbox. For docs that don’t fit well into Evernote – spreadsheets, etc. * Wordpress. For managing the blog.</p>

<p>“News” apps:</p>

<p>* Echofon for Twitter stream access. I’ve tried the official Twitter app and it is fine, but I am used to Echofon. * Byline for RSS feeds. I’ve been using this for a longtime, there may be better choices, but I am comfortable with. * NPR for general news. Echofon and Byline both just feed me topics I have self-selected, I need a source of news that informs me more broadly, the NPR app is about right for me.</p>

<p>Reference apps:</p>

<p>* Stocks and Maps. I’ve tried to find upgrades to the Stocks app but there is nothing great that I have found. I’d like something that tied to my Yahoo finance portfolio data. * Weather HD. I am toying with apps that replace the Apple Weather app. Weather HD looks nice but otherwise is no more functional. I really want something like the WX for Ipad app.</p>

<p>Utilities: Settings, Calculator, Clock. Don’t love any of these but need regular access to them, and not worth the trouble to go find upgrades (tho the Apple Clock alarm issues this year have been annoying).</p>

<p>And finally, a folder of Travel apps: TripIt, KAYAK, Southwest, Flight Update, Urbanspoon, OneBusAway, Yelp. The first four get solid use.</p>

<p>Apps that don’t quite make the first page:</p>

<p>* App Store. * Google Voice, previously mentioned * A sports app – ESPN Scorecenter or Yahoo Sportacular. I like the Yahoo app. * Facebook and LinkedIn. I rarely use these anymore. Just don’t get any distinguishing vale. * Kindle and Amazon.com. I rarely read Kindle books on the iPhone. More frequently I shop at Amazon. * Goodreads. Growing in use. * US Bank mobile banking app. * Starbucks Mobile Card app. * Wolfram Alpha. Very episodic use. * Redfin and Zillow. Also very episodic.</p>
