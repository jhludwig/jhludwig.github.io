<p>I haven’t posted anything in months and this is how I choose to re-enter?</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23129410-welcome-to-night-vale">Welcome to Night Vale</a> by Joseph Fink.  Eh.  Fantastical story with fantastical characters, can’t connect with story or people.  I gave up</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forest-Dark-Novel-Nicole-Krauss-ebook/dp/B01N6IHCSA">Forest Dark</a> by Nicole Krauss.  If I knew more about Judaism and about Kafka, I would probably love this.  It was engaging but I was just missing too much due to my ignorance.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27419654-the-last-girl">The Last Girl</a> by Joe Hart.  Yet another post-apocalyptic tale where women have it bad.  This doesn’t really contribute much to the genre</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733990-sleeping-giants">Sleeping Giants</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30134847-waking-gods">Waking Gods</a> by Sylvain Neuvel.  A completely ridiculous premise about our first contact with a superior interstellar race.  OK I kind of liked it but it is ridiculous.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29090844-the-stars-are-legion">The Stars are Legion</a> by Kameron Hurley.  Some far distant future where technology and biology and humanity are completely intertwined.  Just OK.</li>
</ul>
