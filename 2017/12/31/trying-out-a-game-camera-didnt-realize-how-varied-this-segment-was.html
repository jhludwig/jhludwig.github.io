<p>We don’t hunt but we like to observe the critters around us.  Trying out the <a href="http://bushnell.com/wildlife/trail-cameras/trophy-cam/trophy-cam-hd-aggressor-wireless">Bushnell Aggressor</a> – no idea if it is the best, but got decent reviews, and we wanted the cellular capability.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2017/12/trying-out-a-game-camera-didnt-realize-how-varied-this-segment-was/ff4dbe6b-dcc1-4623-baf5-13a948f0ddd8/"><img src="images/ff4dbe6b-dcc1-4623-baf5-13a948f0ddd8-300x225.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Bushnell offers its own portal at <a href="http://www.wirelesstrophycam.com">wirelesstrophycam.com</a> and also includes a trial offer for <a href="http://deerlab.com/bushnell">Deerlab</a> which seems to have a bunch more features.  The device also comes with a 30 day wireless trial plan and notifies via text or email of new captures, and apparently you can extend the data plan without a contract which is nice..  It can be configured to capture video or pictures as desired.  It uses an impressive 12 AA batteries but apparently can also be hooked up to a solar panel.</p>

<p>The first critter it spotted is not surprising or particularly alarming!  I will deploy it in a location more likely to see deer, otter, mink, etc in the future.</p>
