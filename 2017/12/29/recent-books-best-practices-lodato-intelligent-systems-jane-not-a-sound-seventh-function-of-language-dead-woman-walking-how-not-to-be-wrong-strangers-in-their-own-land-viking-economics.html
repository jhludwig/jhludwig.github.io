  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Journal-Best-Practices-Marriage-Asperger-ebook/dp/B004T4KRJM">The Journal of Best Practices</a> by David Finch.  Engaging tale of a man who set out methodically to improve his relationships.  Good counsel for all of us.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edgar-Lucy-Novel-Victor-Lodato-ebook/dp/B01KFWOL5W">Edgar &amp; Lucy</a> by Victor Lodato.  Intriguing and I seemed to enjoy, but somehow just never finished.  I am not sure why.  I guess I am not really in a fantasy mood.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Systems-Engineers-Scientists-Third-ebook/dp/B00BC926LE">Intelligent Systems for Engineers and Scientists</a> by Adrian Hopgood.  Kind of dated at this point.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2017/12/recent-books-best-practices-lodato-intelligent-systems-jane-not-a-sound-seventh-function-of-language-dead-woman-walking-how-not-to-be-wrong-strangers-in-their-own-land-viking-economics/81nbm5pahzl/"><img src="images/81nBM5PAhZL-200x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jane-Unlimited-Kristin-Cashore-ebook/dp/B01MY28M5P">Jane, Unlimited</a> by Kristin Cashore.  Good reviews but ugh, choppy and poorly developed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Not-Sound-Thriller-Heather-Gudenkauf-ebook/dp/B01M8M9IW1">Not A Sound</a> by Heather Gudenkauf.  Solid thriller – a deaf woman stumbles into a mystery, and increasingly learns that those closest to her may be involved.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Function-Language-Novel-ebook/dp/B01NARGQEU">The Seventh Function of Language</a> by Laurent Binet.  Great book, man did this make me feel uneducated – the art, literature, and culture references flew by me, but well written.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Woman-Walking-Sharon-Bolton-ebook/dp/B06VV8ZRWP">Dead Woman Walking</a> by Sharon Bolton.  Nice thriller set in Scottish border lands with some excellent twists.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical-ebook/dp/B00G3L6JQ4">How Not To Be Wrong</a> by Jordan Ellenberg.  Great discussion of practical math and statistics and how they impact our everyday life.  Really good.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Their-Own-Land-Mourning-ebook/dp/B01EEQ9BSW">Strangers In Their Own Land</a> by Arlie Russell Hochschild.  Another “how does the conservative right think” book.  Useful to try to build empathy.  Let’s hope that the conservative right are reading the equivalent books.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Viking-Economics-How-Scandinavians-Right-ebook/dp/B017QLQ8A6">Viking Economics</a> by George Lakey.  A bit gushing, but still a solid read about Nordic economies and values, and what we can learn from them.  A core point that resonated with me – the Nordic countries have embraced “investing in our people” as a core principle, and a lot of policy decisions stem from that.  This does not seem like a bad idea.</li>
