<p>Some winners and losers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Big-John-Crowley-ebook/dp/B005DB7O0U">Little, Big</a> by John Crowley. Well-regarded and I enjoyed some of the characters, but it lost me when it quickly flipped into faerie. Gave up on.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2017/06/recent-books-crowley-goldbarth-bob-hope-phenomena-raj-harry-august-tom-rob-smith-etc/books-bob_hope_biography-0fd28/"><img src="images/Books-Bob_Hope_Biography-0fd28-198x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Form-Content-Essays/dp/1555977618">The Adventures of Form and Content</a> by Albert Goldbarth. Goldbarth can be challenging but these are excellent essays. I aspire to be as well-read and thoughtful as he is.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Entertainer-Century-Richard-Zoglin-ebook/dp/B00IWTWTFK">Hope</a> by Richard Zoglin. I never thought I’d be interested in a biography of Bob Hope, but a fascinating life story. He was an absolutely dominant entertainer in almost all forms of popular media, and could be incredibly generous, and yet had massive massive flaws. An interesting human being.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phenomena-Governments-Investigations-Extrasensory-Psychokinesis-ebook/dp/B01HZFB2T0">Phenomena</a> by Annie Jacobsen. Got great reviews but the nonsense discussed drove me away. Gave up on.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Empire-British-Conquest-India-ebook/dp/B01IMZ5GFI">The Chaos of Empire</a> by Jon Wilson. Another I abandoned quickly. From past readings I’ve know the British were none too pleasant as they built their empire, and I wanted to learn more, but the early parts of this book just droned on and on with no insight.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farm-Tom-Rob-Smith-ebook/dp/B00FPQCWR8">The Farm</a> by Tom Rob Smith. His earlier books are excellent, but he just never found his voice in this one. A satisfying ending but not a great read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Fifteen-Lives-Harry-August-ebook/dp/B00ECE9OD4">The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August</a> by Claire North. Fun. Not memorable but fun.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Orbit-Carolyn-Ives-Gilman-ebook/dp/B00R697BMS">Dark Orbit</a> by Carolyn Ives Gilman. My Kindle says I read this, and the Amazon blurb sounds familiar, but for the life of me, I couldn’t tell you anything about. Read whatever you want to into this.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Graves-Full-Jamie-Mason-ebook/dp/B008J2AEQG">Three Graves Full</a> by Jamie Mason. An attempt at a Fargo-like tale but eh. Not funny enough.</li>
</ul>
