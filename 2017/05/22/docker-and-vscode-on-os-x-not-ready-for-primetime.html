<p>My workflow for years on my MBP has centered on VMWare running Debian/Ubuntu, and all my tools in the VM.</p>

<p>For developing code targeting AWS services, I thought I’d try using Docker for Mac and running Debian images with Docker.</p>

<p>Well that didn’t work. <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/time-in-container-is-out-of-sync/16566">This bug involving time drift in a container</a> has been around for a year now, with no attention paid to it. It basically makes it impossible to access any AWS services. I have to conclude that no one is actually using Docker for Mac.</p>

<p>I’ve also for years used a variety of editors and IDEs on both the Mac and Linux side. I heard such good things about VSCode that I decided to try it. But after any amount of time running it, it starts to miss keystrokes – I first noticed it wasn’t responding to copy/paste from the keyboard, then it also started to fail on simple text entry. I have no time for this, as cool as VSCode may be, it fails on the fundamentals.</p>
