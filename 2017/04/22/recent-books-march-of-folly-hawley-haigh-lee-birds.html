  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/March-Folly-Troy-Vietnam-ebook/dp/B00589AYWW">The March of Folly</a> by Barbara Tuchman<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2017/04/recent-books-march-of-folly-hawley-haigh-lee-birds/satin-bower-bird-nest/"><img src="images/Satin-Bower-Bird-Nest-300x199.jpg" alt="" /></a>. Not a new book but pretty timeless lessons. Our country is certainly making missteps yet again in the Middle East.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Before-Fall-Noah-Hawley-ebook/dp/B0151YQUTE">Before the Fall</a> by Noah Hawley. Excellent mystery about the crash of a private plane, in which every passenger and crew member has secrets that may have been in play.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Light-Novel-Jennifer-Haigh-ebook/dp/B00S569ME6">Heat and Light</a> by Jennifer Haigh. A failing small town and the people in it, struggling with the arrival of fracking. I didnâ€™t love it but seems timely.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Dive-novel-Jonathan-Lee-ebook/dp/B00ZNE44VY">High Dive</a> by Jonathan Lee. A fictionalization of the events around a 1984 bombing in Brighton England. Engaging but not amazing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Birds-Jennifer-Ackerman-ebook/dp/B0125VU7LI">The Genius of Birds</a> by Jennifer Ackerman. Great studies of birds and their behaviors. Go look up images of the bowers created by bowerbirds, truly confounding.</li>
