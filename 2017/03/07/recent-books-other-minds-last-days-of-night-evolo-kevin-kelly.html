  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Other-Minds-Octopus-Origins-Consciousness/dp/0374227764">Other Minds</a> by Peter Godfrey-Smith. <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2017/03/recent-books-other-minds-last-days-of-night-evolo-kevin-kelly/41pkz1uhoul-_sy344_bo1204203200_/"><img src="images/41pkZ1uhOuL._SY344_BO1204203200_-225x300.jpg" alt="" /></a>A dive into the nature of consciousness and how it might vary across entities, with a deep look at cephalopods, who have a very different nervous system than humans. Most fascinating to me was the description of their skin, with its color change capability, embedded photoreceptors, and highly distributed nervous system. I would have liked more cephalopod info.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Night-Novel/dp/0812988906">Last Days of Night</a> by Graham Moore. Fictionalization of the early days of the electrification of the country. Very interesting parallels to the tech booms of the last 30 years.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/eVolo-Skyscrapers-Visionary-Architecture-Design/dp/193874022X">Evolo Skyscrapers 3</a>. Wow, this coffee table book of imaginative future skyscraper designs could keep me occupied forever. Drones, fantastic trains, innovative green technology, disaster-resistance, extreme climates, etc. Super fun.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inevitable-Understanding-Technological-Forces-Future/dp/0525428089">The Inevitable</a> by Kevin Kelly. I avoided reading this for a while and I donâ€™t know why. A little bloated but an excellent look at the forces of change that are driving through our economy. Highly recommended.</li>
