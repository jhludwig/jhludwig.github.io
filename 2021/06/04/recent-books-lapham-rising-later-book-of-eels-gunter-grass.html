  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/826283.Lapham_Rising">Lapham Rising</a> by Roger Rosenblatt. Kind of in the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove">A Man Called Ove</a> genre, with a little farce thrown in, a crotchety aging man comes to terms with his life.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54798175-later">Later</a> by Stephen King. Less horror and more detective. King is pretty darn good at making you empathize with a character very quickly, I was very motivated to find out what happens.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51938590-the-book-of-eels">The Book of Eels</a> by Patrik Svennson, Agnes Broomé (translator). Interesting look at eels and how they figured in the author’s life. I had no idea eels were such a strange creature. And while it didn’t always click for me, the writer’s entwining of his own personal journey was a good effort to make the book connect on a more emotional level.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35741.Too_Far_Afield">Too Far Afield</a> by Günter Grass. This book was too far afield for me. Written by a German for Germans, I could just never climb the hill of references and break into the story.</li>
