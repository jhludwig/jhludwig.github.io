<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/digital-twins/">Azure</a> has a notion of “digital twins” as part of its IoT solution, there are similar ideas around the AWS IoT platform.  I have never found this abstraction to help me.  <a href="https://blog.abodit.com/posts/2021-03-15-Digital-Twins/">Ian Mercer has some excellent observations</a> about the issues around digital twins.  I wonder if the “digital twin” terminology is actually doing us a great disservice – in no way are the cloud and physical representations the same thing.  In the cloud you a desired state, a history of communications with the device, and the mapping of the logical to physical device, and on the edge the physical device rests in its actual state.  Calling this assemblage “twins” just doesn’t seem helpful.</p>
