  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52668915">Entangled Life</a> by Merlin Sheldrake. Gosh I wanted to love this book, and there are some fascinating snippets in it about the amazing role of fungi in our world and lives. But a little too much telling me what I should learn, and not enough examples and stories, which are the memorable and instructive elements.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180270.Ammonite">Ammonite</a> by Nicola Griffith. Been sitting on my shelf for years, not sure why I never got to it. Great tale of settlement of an alien world, and how the world changes us. Great characters.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29999.The_Maltese_Falcon?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=qDAT8AV7uh&amp;rank=1">The Maltese Falcon</a> by Dashiell Hammett. Just felt like I should read it given its classic status. Didnâ€™t love it, but fun to experience.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15701217-the-woman-upstairs">The Woman Upstairs</a> by Claire Messud. A woman going thru the full throes of a midlife crisis, lurching around as she more deeply examines and questions her life and relationships. I loved the ending, powerful.</li>
