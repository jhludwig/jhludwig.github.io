  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12814333-a-stranger-in-olondria">A Stranger in Olondria</a> by Sofia Samatar. I wanted to stick with this book, it had some nice language, but it just was tiring. The story progressed at such a slow rate, and the characters just weren’t appealing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490533-radiance">Radiance</a> by Catherynne Valente. A “decopunk pulp SF alt-history space opera mystery”. My first in this category. Certainly unique. And wouldn’t we all like to live in a universe where all the planets in the solar system were perfectly habitable. I think there is a perfectly good noir story hidden in here, but the space opera and funky structuring kind of get in the way of the story.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358538-a-libertarian-walks-into-a-bear">A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear</a> by Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling. Pretty funny true tale of remote New Hampshire. Libertarians crack me up.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578297-the-midnight-library">The Midnight Library</a> by Matt Haig. Nice inspirational tale about a woman in crisis. Afterlife, many worlds theory, fun stuff going on, and yet very introspective.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map">The Culture Map</a> by Erin Meyer. I’ve read bits and pieces of these ideas in the past, I probably should have read the whole book sometime when I was still managing people spread around the world. A nice framework to help you understand and frame communications.</li>
