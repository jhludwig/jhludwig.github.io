<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-ev-electric-car-ford-mach-e-road-trip-charging-problems-2021-9">Tesla beats Mustang thanks to charging network</a> — the traditional car OEMs really don’t seem to understand how big a software hole they are in.  It is not just autonomy or entertainment systems, but the entire end-to-end lifecycle of the car – presales website, configurator, post-sale site and services, charging network software, mobile app, in-car software, etc.   It is all driven by software and Tesla is ahead on all of it.</p>

<p>I am glad to see Xevo alum end up in so many great places — Amperity, Docusign, Curbside, Axon, Afresh, Clearscale, Discovery, Dignifi, Indeed, Amazon, News Break, Crowdstrike, Stoke Space Tech, Slalom, Google, Oracle, and more I probably missed.   Good luck to you all!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/jen-stark-shawna-x-ix-shells-foundation-nft-art-digital-030921">Some of this art is beautiful and entrancing</a>, <a href="https://foundation.app/">Foundation</a> seems like a good exchange to find NFT art.  A lot of it is generative content, created by neural nets, using a lot of shaders.  It can create very engaging content.  I love dorking around with shaders and neural nets as much as anyone, and i have no skill/practice in creating art, so I really admire this work, but I can’t wrap my head around paying $5k-30K for a rendered video capture of one of these.  Maybe I would pay that much for source code access.  </p>

<p>Who is paying these prices (and more) for generative content (much of which has much less artistic content than the ones I prefer)?  <a href="https://seths.blog/2021/09/speculation-is-the-new-luxury-good/">Yet another argument that this is all just unfounded speculation</a>.</p>

<p>It is easy to discount all this NFT and crypto stuff as speculation.  <a href="https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1439355994371289090?s=20">But the quality of talent diving into it</a> is significant.  </p>
