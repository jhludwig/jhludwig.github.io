  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51197260-the-last-flight">The Last Flight</a> by Julie Clark. A great tale of women trying to escape from abusive situations. On the edge of my seat. Well crafted.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56430139-shape">Shape</a> by Jordan Ellenberg. I should love this book but it was just ok. A tricky book to write as the audience is bimodal at least. I found it tedious at times.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</a> by Andy Weir. Admittedly this is a very similar story to The Martian but with two main characters, but still a lot of fun.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26892110-the-library-at-mount-char">The Library at Mount Char</a> by Scott Hawkins. One strange-ass story, really pulled me in. I am not sure I want a heavy diet of this kind of story but one was good.</li>
