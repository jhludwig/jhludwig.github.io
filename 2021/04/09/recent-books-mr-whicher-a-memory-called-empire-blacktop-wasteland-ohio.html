  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1747896.The_Suspicions_of_Mr_Whicher">The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher</a> by Kate Summerscale. It was ok but i had hoped for more info about the development of the detective job and the societal changes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37794149-a-memory-called-empire">A Memory Called Empire</a> by Arkady Martine. A solid start to a series, and appreciate the development of the main character, but not enough action and wonder to keep me involved.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51182571-blacktop-wasteland">Blacktop Wasteland</a> by S. A. Cosby. Great tale of a man trying to live a clean life, but slipping back into what he does best, and fighting the consequences.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39024902-ohio">Ohio</a> by Stephen Marley. Follows a set of high school friends as their paths merge, diverge, and then remerge years after. I thought at first this was social criticism (and it is) but then the tale went some very different ways. Very engaging.</li>
