  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/360562.Sharpe_s_Rifles">Sharpe’s Rifles</a> by Bernard Cornwell. Enjoyable historical novel set during the Napoleonic Wars, a part of a series detailing Sharpe’s rise. Good character, good pacing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4191136-business-adventures">Business Adventures</a> by John Brooks. An insouciant (and I never get to use that word, so damn it, I am pulling it out of the vault when it fits) walk thru business stories of the 50s and 60s. Lyrical, notes of Faulkner, not your traditional business book. And the time machine back into business operations of 60 years ago is fascinating.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51812816-the-aosawa-murders">The Aosawa Murders</a> by Riku Onda. Eh, just couldn’t find a reason to continue.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51342031-the-ministry-for-the-future">The Ministry for the Future</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson. This is the worst good book I have ever read. Too long. A mishmash of wholly different stories which doesn’t work. Too much yelling at the reader instead of delivering a message through story and character. And yet, I read the whole thing, No book has really illustrated how horrible climate change can become as does this book in a few places. I can’t recommend this book, but it may be worth reading.</li>
