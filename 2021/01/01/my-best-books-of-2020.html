<p>This year I read or attempted to read 75 books.  There were some dogs but also some great ones.  I tried to come up with the “best book of the year” but that is pointless, they are all so different.  So I will highlight a number of different books that excelled in different ways. </p>

<p><strong>Best Mystery</strong>:  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/523795.The_Last_Good_Kiss">The Last Good Kiss</a> by James Crumley.  A solid hard-bitten detective tale, everything you want in a private eye.  </p>

<p><strong>Best Adventure</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora">The Lies of Locke Lamora</a> by Scott Lynch.  If you like more fantastical adventures, this is a great tale and really ought to be a movie or TV series.</p>

<p><strong>Best Historical Novel</strong>:  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38140077-washington-black">Washington Black</a> by Esi Edugyan.  If you like your adventures a little more grounded in historical reality, this is for you.  Would also be fantastic on screen.</p>

<p><strong>Best History</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50159458-kent-state">Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio</a> by Derf Backderf.  If you like actual history, this is a great telling of the events at Kent State, and exposes the dangers of involving armed military in civil protests.  Almost chose this for best graphic novel, but for…</p>

<p><strong>Best Graphic Novel</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51323365-solutions-and-other-problems">Solutions and Other Problems</a> by Allie Brosh.  Irreverent, at times hilarious, at times moving.  Well done.  </p>

<p><strong>Best Irreverent</strong>: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28881.Lamb">Lamb, The Gospel According to Biff, Christ’s Childhood Pal</a> by Christoper Moore. Irreverent, some may even view as offensive, but I found it respectful and uplifting in a humanist way.</p>

<p><strong>Best Current Events</strong>:  Getting back to our current situation and lives, there are 3 books that I enjoyed and gave me some insight on myself or the world.  </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50165554-one-billion-americans">One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger</a> by Matthew Yglesias.  You might object to his solution but this book clearly focuses on a challenge we face, and it is hard to imagine solutions that don’t involve growth.  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth">The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics</a> by Eric Beinhocker.  A worthy effort to reexamine economics from first principles.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152447-caste">Caste: The Origins of our Discontents</a> by Isabel Wilkerson.  There are many books you can read on discrimination and racism in our society, this was the best for me.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best Math/Science</strong>.  Digging a little deeper, these were the math/science books that I enjoyed the most this year.  </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36341728-lost-in-math">Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray</a> by Sabine Hossenfelder.  A criticism of current thinking in physics.  I don’t follow physics closely enough to know if this is all warranted.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting">Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction</a> by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner.  We all forecast in our lives, and we are probably all not that great at it, as this book will make you realize.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27068734-but-what-if-we-re-wrong-thinking-about-the-present-as-if-it-were-the-pa">But What If We’re Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past</a> by Chuck Klosterman.  Challenges your thinking about what you know and believe, which is always good.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Would love to hear your thoughts on books you read this year.</p>
