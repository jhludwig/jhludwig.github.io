<p>I’m cleaning some older books off the shelf, and peeking at them as I do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. 20+ years old, and a little dated in its examples (CORBA?) and quotes (a Bill Cosby quote?), but still a solid source of guidance on very basic software craftsmanship.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring">Refactoring</a> by Martin Fowler. Hasn’t aged as well. In a world of cloud services, asynch programming, containers, this just doesn’t seem to line up with the fault lines in modern software.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/685486.Patterns_of_Software">Patterns of Software</a> by Richard P. Gabriel. I wanted to like this, and I suspect there is some great stuff in here, but too abstract and meta for me</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete">Code Complete</a> by Steve McConnell. Back before Stack Overflow, Github, online notebooks, great doc sites, this may have been a great guide to software development. Still great topics, but doesn’t seem like the best way to learn.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then some new ones</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56686093-they-called-us-river-rats">They Called Us River Rats</a> by Macon Fry. A look at the settlements along the batture in the New Orleans area. What a way to live.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52379735-the-echo-wife">The Echo Wife</a> by Sarah Gailey. Nicely paced although the purportedly super smart protagonist didn’t seem to think that far ahead sometimes – if you are super good at cloning people and you need to cover up a death, I don’t think it would take you more than a nanosecond to consider cloning the dead person.</li>
</ul>
