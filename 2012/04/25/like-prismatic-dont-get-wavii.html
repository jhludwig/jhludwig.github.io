<p>In the last two weeks I’ve tried to use some recent news aggregation services. A billion people have been sending me connection notices from “Wavii”:wavii.com, and I just don’t get it. My feed is stuffed full of friend notices and really random news items and stuff that is duplicative of my twitter stream. Nothing worth looking at.</p>

<p>“Prismatic”:getprismatic.com, on the other hand, has been a pleasant surprise, I get much meatier links, with a lot more relevance, and doesn’t duplicate my twitter stream. Is it better than techmeme or other aggregators, I don’t know, but I am getting value out of it.</p>
