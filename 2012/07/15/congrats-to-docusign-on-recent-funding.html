<p>I’m several days late to the news about “Docusign’s most recent funding”:http://www.geekwire.com/2012/esignature-company-docusign-raises-475m-names-mary-meeker-board/. Congrats to everyone involved, it is great to see the company continue to move ahead. I’m an increasingly frequent user of the app, the iPad experience is pretty good, and I know the team is working to make it even better. I have pretty much retired the old “print-sign-scan” cycle that I used to do on everything. There are still a few things they need to make better for me – notably docs with multiple signers – but great great progress by the company. I am starting to see docusign originated docs from non-tech people show up in my inbox unprompted, that is a good good sign.</p>
