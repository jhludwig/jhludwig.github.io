<p>The Samsung NX200 is my 2nd try at moving to a mirrorless camera for my main camera. I previously tried a recent Olympus PEN and it is ok but feels cheap. And with all of Olympus’s corporate woes, hard to feel good about settling on it.</p>

<p>The Samsung tho feels rock solid, a great body. The flash unit is slick. I am still grinding thru all the controls and don’t have an opinion yet on them. But one feature stands out – the AMOLED screen is gorgeous. Great contrast, vibrant, good in daylight. Really beautiful.</p>

<p>Now I just need to pick up some lenses for it – like the “long zoom lens”:http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Movie-18-200mm-lens-Cameras/dp/B004W82I1K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328457973&amp;sr=8-1</p>
