<p>Today’s experience at Fry’s – I’m trying to set up a MythTV box and I need a cable splitter so that I can continue to use my normal TiVO box. And since this is all digital cable, HD quality, I need the large bandwidth splitter, not the crappy old splitters you find anywhere.</p>

<p>So of course, Fry’s has a huge selection of &lt;900Mhz coax splitters and RG59 cable, and right in the prime display area for their TV component section. All of which is useless. And a teeny number of 2G splitters hidden up the aisle. “We specialize in parts that don’t work with most cable/satellite installs and will just frustrate the hell out of you!”</p>

<p>They could cut their floorspace and staff in half if they’d just stock products that might actually work. Who exactly is served by all these crappy parts? I bet 90% of the customers who buy the old splitters return them when they realize they won’t work. Or maybe it is all a scheme to get people to pay for professional install.</p>
