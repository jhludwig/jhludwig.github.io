<p>Heard “Dan Barry”:http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_T._Barry speak at USC grad this past week. What an amazing story. Was rejected by NASA for like 15 years running and refused to give up. Finally made it as an astronaut at age 37. An amazing tale of perseverance. If you ever have a chance to hear his story, it is worth it.</p>
