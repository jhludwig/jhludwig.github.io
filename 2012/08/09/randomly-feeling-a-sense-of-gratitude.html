<p>I whine here about various products at times, products that fail to meet expectations.</p>

<p>But I am sitting here at a Starbucks, using free WIFI, on a lightweight laptop with 6-7 hours of battery life, downloading 200M of software onto a 32G USB key the size of a chiclet, while listening to an infinite selection of music on Spotify, and posting various documents up to a bunch of cloud services, and monitoring a live stream of news from the Olympics. All done at a fraction of the cost you would have expected even 5 years ago. It is honestly pretty freaking amazing what the industry has created over the course of the last several decades.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll try to remember this feeling next time I am whining about button placement or some other nit.</p>
