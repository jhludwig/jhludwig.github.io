<p>Reasons to hate Kansas. Or at least feel really sorry for them:</p>

<p>* Tornados. Lots of them. <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/20120327-161707.jpg"><img src="images/20120327-161707.jpg" alt="" title="twister" /></a> * A state so bad, even it’s namesake city refuses to be in the state. * Just like the Wizard of Oz suggests, the entire state is colorless. * Wikipedia says the name means “people passing wind”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas or something like that * The first us state to adopt prohibition – the least fun most humor impaired state ever. * There is an official state soil. If all you have to celebrate is your dirt, you are one sorry state.</p>

<p>And a joke:</p>

<p>Q. How do you know the toothbrush was invented in Kansas? A. If it was invented anywhere else, it would have been called a teethbrush.</p>
