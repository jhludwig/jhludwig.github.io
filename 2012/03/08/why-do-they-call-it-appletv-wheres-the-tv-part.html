<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tv1.png"><img src="images/tv1.png" alt="" title="tv" /></a>I mean, you can’t really watch TV on it.</p>

<p>Live sports like NFL football or NCAA football or all the upcoming NCAA basketball tournament action? No. That’s at least 50% of the reason we have TV sets and cable service at our house. NHL doesn’t cut it.</p>

<p>The most popular prime time shows like American Idol or The Voice? No. Episodes of popular series the night they come out so you can be current at the water cooler? No. That accounts for most of our other TV expenditure.</p>

<p>Daytime staples like Judge Judy, Ellen? No. I admit sometimes I like to watch Judge Judy bring the hammer down on some moron.</p>

<p>And it isn’t a TV either.</p>

<p>It is not a bad box for what it is, I really like some of the features, and I might get one of the new ones for the music and AirPlay features, but calling it TV just confuses me. I thought maybe the new box would somehow deliver more on the TV promise but not really.</p>
