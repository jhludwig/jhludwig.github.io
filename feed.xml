&lt;p&gt;I’m only 20 years behind, time to jump into &lt;a href=&quot;https://clivethompson.medium.com/how-processing-and-p5-got-newbies-into-coding-dd3853a7adb&quot;&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some super smart software people have gone to work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stokespace.com&quot;&gt;Stoke&lt;/a&gt;.  Wishing them the best, I hope to get out for a visit in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://seths.blog/2021/11/your-big-idea-2/&quot;&gt;“Don’t worry so much about someone stealing your ideas. In fact, it’s probably worth working harder to get people imagining that they might.”&lt;/a&gt; – totally agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tom_peters/status/1459282980317417472?s=20&quot;&gt;Boy, howdy.&lt;/a&gt;  I was once a consultant to F500 companies and it felt like being a carrion bird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great counsel — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hila-segal-1a2358a_productmarketing-sales-pitchdecks-activity-6865698728456671232-QDYM/&quot;&gt;replace pitch decks with teaching decks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23814811-debt&quot;&gt;Debt: The First 5000 Years&lt;/a&gt; — “The one thing we can be confident of is that history is not over, and that wherever the most exciting new ideas of the next century come from, it will almost certainly be from someplace we don’t expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eradicate medical debt for pennies on the dollar — &lt;a href=&quot;https://ripmedicaldebt.org&quot;&gt;RIP Medical Debt&lt;/a&gt;. Need to read more about, but I like that the debtholders take a haircut – there is no way all this pain should accrue to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51820142-escape-from-rome&quot;&gt;Escape from Rome&lt;/a&gt; by Walter Scheidel.  Quite the slog but a compelling argument that the fall of Rome was essential for the creation of the competitve and progressive West.  One wonders how this dynamic will play out over the coming century.  One also wonders if this is an argument for devolving more rights and programs to the state and local level.&lt;/li&gt;

The evolution of debt, markets, and money as seen by an anthropologist.  Vlad and John turned me onto this, it is a bit wordy, but super interesting, a very different view from the conventional wisdom.  I am still processing, it is very relevant to current discussions about student debt forgiveness and debt ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;

And my gosh was this exciting — the wresting of computer power away from controlled impersonal computer centers and delivery into the hands of free individuals.  An explosion of creativity followed.  It was thrilling.  I went to work at Microsoft not because of the financial potential — I didn’t even know what a stock option was.  I went to Microsoft because I had to be part of this revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt this excitment again during the web revolution — letting anyone create a website and making it dramatically easier to reach audiences.  The web was empowering and freeing.  And then the mobile revolution — pushing computing off the desk and into the hands and pockets of people, freeing and empowering again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest technology revolutions all share this sense of freedom and empowerment.  And during these times, mission-driven orgs pop into existence, and people commit to missions, creating career highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are smarter people than me who have articulated the problems with web3/crypto.  Complexity, unnecessary technology, scams, criminality, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ignore all the problems for a moment.  The web3 folks are articulating a vision of freedom and empowerment — freedom from giant corporate walled gardens of identity and content, freedom, to take your data anywhere.  These are good things.  I get why people are excited about freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is anyone else articulating a vision of freedom, empowerment, opportunity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta is at least talking about the metaverse, but it is all locked up in Meta’s hands.  But there might be something there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What bright future are Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple talking about?  They are are incrementalling their current tech, but what breakthrough are they driving in freedom and opportunity?  No one gets excited about the 723rd AWS service, or Windows/Office/Teams version 27, or iOS version 19.  Drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are web3/crypto critics presenting as an alternative? It is not sufficient to say “web3/crypto sucks”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the smartest people I know are moving towards space startups, which has a great mission, but it doesn’t have the freedom and opportunity vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to articulate an alternative vision that leads to more freedom and opportunity. Or people will continue to go down the web3 rabbithole.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I came of age and started my career in the early stages of the PC revolution.

&lt;p&gt;I keep trying to learn about web3 and crypto, some days I wonder why, and then I am reminded “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libertyrpf.com/p/198-bezos-inner-bill-gates-unintended&quot;&gt;…be careful about being too quick to filter out topics because you quickly judge them as boring. Don’t have a fixed mindset about it. There’s interesting stuff everywhere…&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/hot-streaks-in-your-career-dont-happen-by-accident/620514/&quot;&gt;First explore, then exploit&lt;/a&gt;.  I am definitely in exploration mode these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tonyisola.com/2021/10/investors-need-an-anti-reading-list/&quot;&gt;A good reminder to not limit exploration to current media, much of which will be forgotten, but to dive deep&lt;/a&gt; into writing from the past and material off the beaten path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the &lt;a href=&quot;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/&quot;&gt;Internet of Bio-Inspired Things or the Internet of Biological Things&lt;/a&gt; are, but I am intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://critter.blog/2020/10/02/write-5x-more-but-write-5x-less/?utm_campaign=Recomendo&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Write more often, and write more succinctly&lt;/a&gt;.  Good advice, writing is an integral part of exploring and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still haven’t found the best tool to document my explorations for myself and for sharing.  I am using a rube goldberg arrangement of markdown editors, cloud storage, and github pages for publishing.  Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/how-do-you-capture-your-hunches&quot;&gt;more good ideas here about capturing hunches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;web3-skepticism&quot;&gt;Web3 Skepticism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delian Asparouh, a VC at Founder Fund, says it well: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zebulgar/status/1457096407169609729?s=20&quot;&gt;“a tragic misallocation of talent”&lt;/a&gt;.  That is my general feel at the moment, web3 is to tech as the CDO spree of the 2000s was to finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1456416039609188359?s=20&quot;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt; makes the point that much of the existing web started out with a very open sharing model, but commercial entities drove it in a different direction for commercial reasons, and a bunch of new protocols and technologies won’t change the commercial motivations and behaviors.  Web3, if it succeeds, will end up with a bunch of new dominant players (who may just be the old dominant players).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://seths.blog/2021/11/lets-vote-on-it/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin is pushing a DAO for voting in the broadest sense.&lt;/a&gt;  There does seem to be something in the web3 idea of open and programmatic governance, tho the web3 adherents need to dramatically simplify the stack of concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;random&quot;&gt;Random&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/11/02/microsoft-cloud-at-ignite-2021-metaverse-ai-and-hyperconnectivity-in-a-hybrid-world/&quot;&gt;Microsoft is a metaverse company&lt;/a&gt;.  I recall in the mid-90s when Microsoft started talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/024-discovering-cornell-is-wired&quot;&gt;IAYF vision&lt;/a&gt;.  In about 42 nanoseconds the word was coopted by everyone, the Microsoft corporate library announced an IAYF app internally which was just a vb frontend on some db.  The grand vision became meaningless.  If you are going to invest a lot of corporate energy into a word, you should probably make sure the word is distinctive and can be owned by your corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/10/28/let-the-market-worry-for-you/&quot;&gt;Let the Market Worry for You&lt;/a&gt; — espouses the view that there are a ton of people thinking about risks, and that this is therefore all priced into equities, and therefore you shouldn’t let risk concerns keep you from participating in the market.  An interesting view, tho largely formed during an era of sustained market growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_interpretations_of_The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz&quot;&gt;Wizard of Oz may have been a comment on monetary policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ritholtz.com/2021/11/quitters-get-raises/&quot;&gt;Quitters get raises&lt;/a&gt;.  Long known in the tech industry, interesting to see the broader data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November already! It’s voting season again, and a big thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/wa_vbm.pdf&quot;&gt;Washington State vote by mail system&lt;/a&gt; this week, it is really wonderful.  Hard to understand why every state doesn’t learn from, it has certainly driven up my participation and engagement level.  It’s no surprise &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electproject.org/2020g&quot;&gt;Washington is in the top 5 states by participation rate&lt;/a&gt; — and I hope we learn from the top 4 and improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-art-installations&quot;&gt;Interactive Art Installations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a spin thru software for interactive art installs this week.  I used to do some large scale halloween decorating and used DMX control software at that time, software has improved a lot sicne then.  I am particularly interested in video projection mapping, gosh there are a lof of nice choices.  I could just roll something by hand but using one of these seems smart, they all seem to handle multiple projectors mapping onto arbitrary geometries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://madmapper.com&quot;&gt;madmapper&lt;/a&gt;.  Lots of features, lots of guides, nice UI, seems to be reasonably active.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://qlab.app/overview/&quot;&gt;qlab&lt;/a&gt;. Looks very on point, nice iOS companion app&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.millumin.com/v3/index.php&quot;&gt;millumin&lt;/a&gt;.  UI maybe not as slick, but still looks pretty complete&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://troikatronix.com/get-it/&quot;&gt;isadora&lt;/a&gt;.  A little more techie maybe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://derivative.ca&quot;&gt;Touchdesigner&lt;/a&gt;.  Seems to have a very strong pro community around it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://resolume.com/software&quot;&gt;resolume&lt;/a&gt;.  Really nice VJ features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://visution.com&quot;&gt;visution&lt;/a&gt;:  UI not so polished but still looks complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to try a small experiment with one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These additional projects may have promise but they seem limited in some substantial way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heavym.net&quot;&gt;heavym&lt;/a&gt;.  only supports 1 output at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mapmapteam.github.io&quot;&gt;mapmap&lt;/a&gt;.  open source but abandoned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lightform.com/creator&quot;&gt;lightform creator&lt;/a&gt;.  cool but limited to their out of stock hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;web3-this-week&quot;&gt;Web3 this week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I largely stayed away from web3 this week, but I did read a few things.  Haseeb is a bit more rational than some of the adherents — for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://haseebq.com/why-decentralization-isnt-as-important-as-you-think/&quot;&gt;Why decentralization is a bit of a red herring&lt;/a&gt;.  And then Packy McCormick on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notboring.co/p/sc3nius&quot;&gt;sc3nius&lt;/a&gt;, worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.readthegeneralist.com/briefing/dao&quot;&gt;this primer on DAOs&lt;/a&gt;.  I want to like DAOs, there is something interesting about software for new organizational models.  But when you have to understand 87 new concepts and 123 projects to wrap your head around the simplest DAO – well, radical transparency loses its meaning when it is wrapped up in obtuse complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every job has a signficant sales and marketing component.  Engineering is no exception.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/02/13/the-iceberg-secret-revealed/&quot;&gt;You have to communicate what you are doing regularly and emphatically&lt;/a&gt; (and also listen to the response you get, and adapt accordingly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543776992845834&quot;&gt;Ryan Petersen of Flexport on the container issue&lt;/a&gt; – I love this guy.  Not focused on blame or grand policy.  Just digs in, identifies issues, and proposes an array of common sense and direct solutions.  We need more of this kind of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;startup-financing&quot;&gt;Startup Financing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/startup-cap-tables-tracking-open-coaliton-law-firms-software/&quot;&gt;A standard approach to startup cap tables&lt;/a&gt; – seems useful and overdue.  I spent so much time in excel as both an investor and then as a startup founder.  Would be good to regularize this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/1450773701876723715?s=21&quot;&gt;Great thread and data on startup exits&lt;/a&gt;.  I’m surprised at the number of earnouts and I wonder if these are all really earnouts (certain business goals must be hit to get the comp) vs time vesting (employees must stay a certain length of time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;web3-gaming&quot;&gt;Web3 Gaming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been mostly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theludwigs.com/blog/web3&quot;&gt;looking at using web3 as a developer&lt;/a&gt;.  I decided to try from a different direction and use web3 as a user.  The top game seems to be the Axie Infinity game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to jump quite a few hurdles to try out Axie Infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://axieinfinity.com&quot;&gt;Axie Infinity site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then download something called Mavis Hub.  Why is this a different name?  Anyway, downloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then log in with a Ronin Wallet (there are some other choices but this is recommended).  Who or what makes Ronin Wallet?  Don’t know.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then led to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://skymavis.com&quot;&gt;SkyMavis site&lt;/a&gt;, another organization.  Starting to feel like this is part of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ronin wallet only runs in Chrome or Firefox, so get Chrome installed (thought all this web3 stuff was going to free us from the Man).  Ronin wallet plug in installed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now get ETH in the ronin wallet.  Off to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://purchase.roninchain.com&quot;&gt;roninchain site&lt;/a&gt; (yet another organization) with several choices to buy assets with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ramp.network&quot;&gt;Ramp Network&lt;/a&gt;, yet another branded service. 3 choices — WETH, AXS, or SLP.  AXS seems right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And whoa whoa whoa. Just to start playing, need 3 AXS and that is like $380 at today’s prices.  $380 to play this game?  For a pokemon like-game?  Are they naked or something?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First observation — such a jumble of brands and organizations.  The general web3 approach of “we will replace monolithic commerical offerings with a mishmash of micro offerings from orgs you have never heard of” doesn’t really fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the cost to play is ridiculous.  No thanks, I am not putting $380 into this.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexhopmann/status/1450928569698320388&quot;&gt;smart observer compared it to a pyramid scheme&lt;/a&gt;, and later arrivers like me have to dump a lot of cash in to support the earlier adopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are easier and cheaper ways to have fun or to speculate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that new platforms might be cruftier and clumsier than the mature solutions of the preceding generation but there has to be something positive about web3.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Leadership Lessons</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Web3, Crypto, and other random things this week</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/web3-crypto-other" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Web3, Crypto, and other random things this week" /><published>2021-10-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-10-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/web3-crypto-other</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/web3-crypto-other">&lt;h3 id=&quot;web3-crypto-this-week&quot;&gt;web3, crypto this week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kept on trying to learn about web3 this week,taking a random walk thru services. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dfinity.org&quot;&gt;dfinity.org&lt;/a&gt; is complicated to grok, &lt;a href=&quot;https://smartcontracts.org/docs/quickstart/network-quickstart.html&quot;&gt;the “hello world” app for a hosted app is a little byzantine&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://fleek.co&quot;&gt;fleek.co&lt;/a&gt; was a little easier to use tho i seem to have lost my app. I am still trying to understand what &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io&quot;&gt;ipfs&lt;/a&gt; is good for.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://polkadot.network&quot;&gt;polkadot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://substrate.io&quot;&gt;substrate&lt;/a&gt; seem like ingredients, not solutions.  Everyone introduces a bunch of new unique terminology, I am awash in concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am bullish on the idea that there is some application use for web3 infrastructure, tho nothing I am finding is really compelling yet, and the complexity of using them is orders of magnitude too high.   The cost to use any of these services is a complicated mystery; there is a lot of value in a publicly maintained, clear price list for services as is provided by AWS or Azure or GCS — I can have a “hello world” lambda up and running in minutes with a very clear cost expectation and a lot of cost and scale controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be great if someone made it trivially easy to move s3 storage to ipfs, and demonstrated exactly how that would be substantially cheaper.  Cloudflare is attempting to move s3 usage to r2 — &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-r2-object-storage/&quot;&gt;full s3 compatibility at a much lower cost&lt;/a&gt; – they are making it trivial to understand – I get that.  If some IPFS offering would do the same, I would get that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I am quite sure about — the “Goodbye AWS!” sentiment on various web3 sites — how running an app on the blockchain will free apps from the tyranny of AWS (and Azure and Google…) — this is false.  The blockchain operates on hardware that some organization is hosting and operating.  There will be organizations that are better at operating hardware at scale, and they will aggregate up a bunch of blockchain processing traffic and then they will have the new Amazon (which might be the same as the old Amazon).  This is just the nature of industries, every industry since the beginning of time has behaved this way – “Meet the new boss, same as the old boss”.  I suspect a lot of vendors and investors understand this dynamic very well and are being disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also keep reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coinbase-proposes-crypto-focused-financial-regulator-to-replace-sec-for-oversight-of-digital-assets-11634235099&quot;&gt;“crypto currency is different, we need a different regulatory regime.”&lt;/a&gt;  Regulatory structures are in place, in part, to moderate the behaviour of the powerful and to protect the individual investors (and yes are abused by established players to achieve regulatory capture, but that is not a reason to drop them).  When I hear a new entrant claiming we need a whole new regulatory regime, they are either naive about how this will play out — or they are disingenuous, they want to be a dominant player in the new regime and capture outsize rewards.  THey are not acting on the behalf of the individual investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variant of this is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ripple-ceo-its-a-joke-that-some-execs-believe-sec-isnt-harming-crypto?utm_source=sg&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;amp;utm_content=article-6427&quot;&gt;The SEC’s posture towards crypto in the US is definitely hurting innovation&lt;/a&gt;”.  Well yes it may be slowing innovation and this seems like a feature, not a bug.  Maintaining a market that protects small investors and encourages them to participate in the market is a very good thing.  Financial “innovators” often do not protect small investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burden is on the crytpocurrency innovators to fully embrace the protections provided by the SEC and demonstrate how they can operate within those strictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have always used “consumer grade” networking gear in our house.  Cable modems off of Amazon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://eero.com&quot;&gt;Eero&lt;/a&gt; wifi access points (and apple wifi access points before that).  The Eeros have a great mobile app and have generally been easy to setup and largely bulletproof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t love being the IT guy for the house.  So against my better judgement, in our current house I was talked into mid-market “var friendly” devices — &lt;a href=&quot;https://araknisnetworks.com&quot;&gt;Araknis routers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commscope.com/product-type/enterprise-networking/wireless-access-points/&quot;&gt;Ruckus access points&lt;/a&gt; with professional install.  It has not been very clean.  These vendors have crap mobile apps and the gear isn’t designed for users to manage.  Our installer is not able to debug as he is busy doing installs.  There is no consumer support path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our WiFi networks kept dropping a couple times a day.  We complained about and got no answers besides “have you tried rebooting”.  So I wrote a python script to monitor our connection every 10 seconds, and discovered that our connections were dropping every 12 hours exactly.  I put my macbook on the wired network and ran the same script, no drops.  So it seemed access point specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After weeks of badgering my installer, I finally got login admin access to both the Araknis routers and the Ruckus access points.  The Araknis system logs show no problems.  The Ruckus access points all reported connectivity problems every 12 hours.  Ding ding.  Back to the Araknis UI, and guess what the DHCP lease length is set to?  12 hours.  Ding ding ding.  I set it to 72 hours and all has been relatively good since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many problems here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our installer doesn’t have the time or depth to solve these problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Ruckus and Araknis products don’t expose config tools to users.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Araknis has a stupid 12 hour default for DHCP.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Ruckus devices are stupidly on dynamic IPs by default, and all 3 of them try to do lease renewal at the exact same time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neither Araknis nor Ruckus have effective consumer support services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Ruckus issues with DHCP are clearly known in user forums, for some time, and Ruckus does nothing about.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All of this just creates pain for consumers and for our installer.  If I was an installer I would dump all this crap and install consumer grade devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all these problems go away with &lt;a href=&quot;https://eero.com&quot;&gt;Eeros&lt;/a&gt;.  I hear very good things about &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.com/consoles&quot;&gt;Unifi&lt;/a&gt; too tho their website reads like they are creeping into the mid-market which scares me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am probably never going to get to step out of the role of home IT guy.  All I can do is buy products that automate a lot of the problems away or give me easy self service solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-tokens-exactly&quot;&gt;What are tokens exactly?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I am not in the router weeds, I am trying to keep up with the new hotness.  This is a good explanation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomtunguz.com/equity-cap-table-vs-token-cap-table/&quot;&gt;cap tables for crypto companies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically when an entity issues a financial instrument, it is backed by some guarantee of financial value.  The government issues currency, backed by the taxing power of the government.  Municipalities issue bonds, backed by their taxing power.  Corporations issue bonds, backed by their ability to generate cash to cover the bonds.  Companies issue equity, which is a claim on the cash flow and earnings of the company.  Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly are tokens backed by?  They aren’t a claim on the issuing company’s cash flow or equity. (And why not?)  The company could create an arbitrary number of new distinct token offerings.  A token is just a claim on the part of the token pool it is in, and there is no economic value associated with that, except for whatever the token holders decide, or what the tokens can be traded for.  They seem pretty vacuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maybe-i-am-done-with-the-tech-industry-for-now&quot;&gt;Maybe I am done with the tech industry for now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech industry has always had an affinity for hucksterism.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt&quot;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware&quot;&gt;vaporware&lt;/a&gt; were big deals when I started in the industry.  (And it is not like the tech industry originated these practices – go read the history of Edison, or the various trading companies during the mercantile era.  I am sure these practices span all of human commercial activity and will continue to do so.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you tire of it.  And as I try to keep up with crypto and NFTs, I find myself more and more aligned with some of the harsh critics – &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman/status/1445986978189639680?s=20&quot;&gt;NFT criticism&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Olson, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CapnKarlisle/status/1447965481281933320?s=20&quot;&gt;more NFT criticism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/smdiehl&quot;&gt;crypto critic&lt;/a&gt; Stephen Diehl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could just sit back and be a critic.  But maybe I should just be done with the tech industry for a while.  I will always be an enthusiastic user of tech.  But the industry machinations and hype cycle is just not fun or interesting right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-i-dont-really-want-to-quit-understanding-change&quot;&gt;But I don’t really want to quit understanding change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day you quit embracing change and quit learning is the day you die, or at least that is what my grandfather said.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://seths.blog/2021/10/shift-your-tech-time-horizon/&quot;&gt;Seth Godin on embracing change&lt;/a&gt; – “We can choose to live behind the curve or ahead of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a slightly different formulation of this.  Technology change, and change of any sort, is constantly sweeping through our society, largely uncontrolled by any of us, crashing like waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the wave metaphor is good — you can deal with these waves in a couple ways.  You can twist your feet into the sand, anchoring yourself, and try to fight off the waves.  Or — you can grab a board and surf them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/10/12/jolts-workers-quitting-august-pandemic/&quot;&gt;Something big is changing in our society about employment&lt;/a&gt;.  I don’t really understand it yet.  I am listening and learning.  When the generation before ours went to work, they dedicated themselves to a company for a lifetime, and the company dedicated itself to them.  My generation still had a lot of that, tho 5-10 years at a job was considered an ok amount of time, and company pensions started to disappear.  The commitment level on both sides has continued to drift down. It is going to be interesting to see how this evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;random-things-bubbling-up-to-the-surface&quot;&gt;Random things bubbling up to the surface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do love &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakfastny.com/works&quot;&gt;interactive art&lt;/a&gt;.  I might play around with &lt;a href=&quot;https://troikatronix.com&quot;&gt;Isadora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
