Brilliant little stories about what it really is to be human and how to accept others.  Can’t recommend highly enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31363503-terminal-alliance&quot;&gt;Terminal Alliance&lt;/a&gt; by Jim C. Hines.  Engaging space opera.  No new ground covered but likable characters and good plotting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48549206-how-asia-works&quot;&gt;How Asia Works&lt;/a&gt; by Joe Studwell.  A bit dense but a very good analysis of country development in Asia – what has worked, what has failed.  A lot of excellent analysis of the policies that led to success in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.   I loved this line – “At the industrial policy-making level, what stands out with the benefit of hindsight is that there was almost no role played in Japan, Korea, or Taiwan by economists.”  Most of the advice by big-brained western consultants and agencies has been dead wrong.&lt;/li&gt;

Wow this is a lot of J. Edgar Hoover info.  He was certainly a central figure in the 20th century.  A sobering story about the accumulation of power, and the abuse of power, by him and by politicians around him.  We are not well served by elected or appointed officials with long terms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42837514-gender-queer&quot;&gt;Gender Queer: A Memoir&lt;/a&gt; by Maia Kobabe.  An easy to read memoir, a good introduction to one person’s story about gender.  Much I don’t know about these issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/682681.She&quot;&gt;She: A History of Adventure&lt;/a&gt; by H. Rider Haggard. Been on my shelves for years, finally cracked it.  A rip roaring tale tho obviously hasn’t aged well.&lt;/li&gt;

Another blood boiler.  Very difficult to be positive about alliance with Saudi Arabia after reading this.  Also makes me even more pro-renewables so that we can stop dealing with these turds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259789.The_Blood_of_the_Lamb&quot;&gt;The Blood of the Lamb&lt;/a&gt; by Peter de Vries.  Oof, what a gut punch.  A man struggles for meaning and faith over the course of a life in which he loses his brother, first love, his wife, his parents, his daughter. And somehow de Vries injects levity in the story.  Great admiration for the writing.&lt;/li&gt;

So many pithy insights – “People just aren’t thinking about you that much.”, “By celebrating people for their intelligence, we make them stupid”, “Action creates traction, so each step you take will facilitate the next.”&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149607.Breakheart_Pass&quot;&gt;Breakheart Pass&lt;/a&gt; by Alistair MacLean.  As a kid I read all MacLean’s books and loved them.  As a lark I reread one.  OK it is overwritten, under-edited, a little trite – but there is a great story in the bones of this book, I understand why I ate them up.&lt;/li&gt;

The story of the end of the Soviet Union and the rise of the current Russian goverment/society told thru the stories of people who endured it.  Very sobering assessment of Russian society and government, the enthusiasm for and commitment to totalitarianism runs deep.  Even more a supporter of a free Ukraine after reading this.&lt;/li&gt;

A little histrionic at times, and overly long and repetitive, but raises good issues.  There is a glaring hole in the recommendations, there is no way we can depend on inspections of manufacturing facilities in the US or overseas to ensure quality, we have to perform random sample testing of product in the field and take fast action based on problems identified.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, the site doesn’t match with my interests.  It is becoming an outrage fest and Elon is encouraging that.  Elon posts provocative stuff, people express outrage, and other people express outrage about the outrage.  Elon isn’t the only driver of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is we are awash in tools to express ourselves, it has never been easier to get your voice out and connect with people.  I read and post on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Mastodon, Post, Goodreads, Discord, Wordpress, Github, and more.  I’ve considered and discarded so many alternatives, I can’t remember them all.  Social networks, microblogging platforms, short message platforms, video clip sharing services, photo sharing services, blogging tools, newsletter tools, website hosting, discussion forums, video hosting services — there are so many tools available and more every day.  I can’t keep up with them all, I have probably missed entire categories of tools.  And in every category there are multiple choices, with multiple different content policies.  There is a place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

Interesting look at the stresses in American society in 1942.  We look back now and feel like our victory in WWII was inevitable and that all Americans pulled together.  Reality is much messier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180098-the-overstory&quot;&gt;The Overstory&lt;/a&gt; by Richard Powers.  I don’t get it.  Plodding.  Couldn’t be bothered to finish it.&lt;/li&gt;

Reeves.  Very thought provoking.  This is not some apologist text about men, it is a very critical view of how we are raised and molded and demands that we do better.  It is also very critical of Democratic Party approaches to the issue.  The solutions are a little too straight line but worth reading.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41436213-sandworm&quot;&gt;Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin’s Most Dangerous Hackers&lt;/a&gt; by Andy Greenberg.

And it has inspired me to think about my all time favorites.  I have 1200+ books listed on Goodreads and I am sure there are another 500-1000 I’ve read that I have never put on Goodreads (for instance, I read every Allen Drury political drama back in my teens, loved them, but I’ve never bothered to put on Goodreads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I narrowed my list down to 6 with some alternates as well.  (Sorry I couldn’t get to 5, Bill is better at this than I am)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/378.The_Phantom_Tollbooth&quot;&gt;The Phantom Tollbooth&lt;/a&gt; by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer.  This book hooked me on reading as a young reader, I loved the story and the wordplay.  It is probably not a great adult book read but I think it is fabulous for young readers.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17157681-the-hobbit-part-one&quot;&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/a&gt; is of course a great choice as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama&quot;&gt;Rendezvous with Rama&lt;/a&gt; by Arthur C. Clarke.  I read a ton of classic science fiction and I loved much of it.  Rama really had a sense of mystery and wonder that I enjoyed.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234225.Dune&quot;&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion&quot;&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt; are great books in the genre as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423.The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness&quot;&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; by Ursula K. Leguin.  I love all of Leguin’s works, this book showed me that speculative fiction could be so much deeper.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334176.The_Sparrow&quot;&gt;The Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent choice too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1138543.The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England&quot;&gt;The Strange Death of Liberal England&lt;/a&gt; by George Dangerfield.  One of my favorite history books about a period of great change, just so well written. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1128055.Hitler_s_Thirty_Days_to_Power&quot;&gt;Hitler’s Thirty Days to Power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50159458-kent-state&quot;&gt;Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio&lt;/a&gt; are excellent choices as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262304.The_Wild_Party&quot;&gt;The Wild Party&lt;/a&gt; by Joseph Moncure March with illustrations by Art Spiegelman.  A quirky little piece of fiction that I find incredibly entertaining.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11149.The_Screwtape_Letters&quot;&gt;The Screwtape Letters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288259-dear-committee-members&quot;&gt;Dear Committee Members&lt;/a&gt; are fun choices too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54218.The_Mismeasure_of_Man&quot;&gt;The Mismeasure of Man&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Jay Gould.  All of Gould’s work is excellent, this set of analyses is well argued and well written.

&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Bill Gates recently posted some of his favorite books. And it has inspired me to think about my all time favorites. I have 1200+ books listed on Goodreads and I am sure there are another 500-1000 I’ve read that I have never put on Goodreads (for instance, I read every Allen Drury political drama back in my teens, loved them, but I’ve never bothered to put on Goodreads).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recent Books – Knight Series, Pyramid of Lies, Spin, The Secret History</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/knight" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recent Books – Knight Series, Pyramid of Lies, Spin, The Secret History" /><published>2022-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/knight</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/knight">&lt;ul&gt;

The first book is a good start to a thriller series featuring a young African assassin who has been thru a hellacious early life, and is now starting to avenge herself.  The tale continues int he second book, which loses its way for a little while, although ends well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61640141-the-pyramid-of-lies&quot;&gt;The Pyramid of Lies: Lex Greensill and the Billion-Dollar Scandal&lt;/a&gt; by Duncan Mavin.  More detail than I really wanted on this scandal.  I am excited to read the equivalent about Sam Bankman-Fried some day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59028343-spin&quot;&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Charles Wilson.  Great tale of three close friends who deal with the transformation of Earth by alien technologies.  Great characters dealing with stress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29044.The_Secret_History&quot;&gt;The Secret History&lt;/a&gt; by Donna Tartt.  This book seems well written, but the characters are unpleasant and the situation is unpleasant and I just didn’t enjoy putting this into my head.  Moving on.&lt;/li&gt;

This has been a long read, and an exceptional read.  So much I didn’t know.  Heartbreaking, so much ill will and bad behaviour between the countries, serving no one’s purpose.  Such opportunity lost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18904629-the-toaster-project&quot;&gt;The Toaster Project: Or A Heroic Attempt to Build a Simple Electric Appliance from Scratch&lt;/a&gt; by Thomas Thwaites.  A very short book documenting this project. Reminds you of just how advanced and specialized and interconnected our society is; the days of living along off the land are long gone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37173847-foundryside&quot;&gt;Foundryside&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Jackson Bennett.  Quite entertaining fantasy romp.  A young thief gains access to magical secrets and upends the power structure of a country.  Good characters.  First of a series and I’m sure I’d enjoy the rest, tho this works very well on its own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60399061-freezing-order&quot;&gt;Freezing Order: A True Story of Money Laundering, Murder, and Surviving Vladimir Putin’s Wrath&lt;/a&gt; by Bill Browder.  A pretty exciting tale about money laundering and the attempts to fight it over the last 2 decades.  A very dangerous fight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60842883-nazi-billionaires&quot;&gt;Nazi Billionaires: The Dark History of Germany’s Wealthiest Dynasties&lt;/a&gt; by David de Jong.  A long retelling of the wealth of some of Germany’s richest people, and how many of these families benefitted from Nazi ties.  The book kind of loses its way in the flood of never ending details and maybe that is the point – the ties to the Nazis were pervasive, and never really resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
