  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59568617-american-psychosis&quot;&gt;American Psychosis&lt;/a&gt; by David Corn.  OK this book annoyed me.  1) It is a bit of a screed; no one who doesn’t already agree with the author is going to be swayed.  2) He puts all the blame for the Republican Party behaviour on some of the politicians in the party – but not on the voters who put them in office.  3) There is no recognition of the part the Democratic Party has played; voters have opted for some bad Republican choices because they are angry at Democratic choices and Democratic party behaviour.  Not a helpful book.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952341-the-grace-of-kings&quot;&gt;The Grace of Kings&lt;/a&gt; by Ken Liu.  Entertaining, Game of Thrones-light.  All the drama and intrigue in one fast-paced story.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114545-too-like-the-lightning&quot;&gt;Too Like The Lightning&lt;/a&gt; by Ada Palmer.  An interesting political setup, ruined by all kinds of literary and romantic overhead.  I am sad I read the whole book.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104023.The_Big_Book_of_Secret_Hiding_Places&quot;&gt;The Big Book of Secret Hiding Places&lt;/a&gt; by Jack Luger.  Not that big, but has some creative ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217432753-the-ai-con&quot;&gt;The AI Con&lt;/a&gt; by Emily Bender and Alex Hanna.  I gave up 20 pages in.  The authors are so bent against technology and innovation, I simply didn’t trust anything they said.  I’d be interested in more rational critiques of AI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933306-stolen-focus&quot;&gt;Stolen Focus&lt;/a&gt; by Johann Hari.  75% of this book is great.  Allowing oursleves to get into flow state, making the changes in our how we spend our time, helping our kids to grow these skills and have better lives – all great stuff, and all researched well.  Then he spends the last chapter on a degrowth rant for which he has done no research, and applied no critical thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4952.What_Is_the_What&quot;&gt;What is the What&lt;/a&gt; by Dave Eggers.  A novelized biography of Valentino Achak Deng, a Sudanese refugee who came to the US.  Amazing story of survival and perseverance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222796693-cross-purposes&quot;&gt;Cross Purposes: Christianity’s Broken Bargain with Democracy&lt;/a&gt; by Jonathan Rauch.  A thoughtful look at the failure of American Christianity to live up to its democratic ideals, and how it can do better.&lt;/li&gt;

A sharper and more pointed look at the same topic as Rauch.  Good info on how to counter bad biblical interpretations, but a little snarky.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13689443-philosophical-devices&quot;&gt;Philosophical Devices&lt;/a&gt; by David Papineau.  I probably would have loved this at a younger age, but a little too “angels on the head of a pin” for me now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57132832-the-lyrics&quot;&gt;The Lyrics&lt;/a&gt; by Paul McCartney.  We may never get an autobiography from him, but this is pretty dang close.  Stories about the songs and where he was in his life when he wrote them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85908812-man-s-search-for-meaning&quot;&gt;Man’s Search for Meaning&lt;/a&gt; by Viktor E. Frankl.  A classic, and a must-read for anyone who has ever struggled with the meaning of life.  I am motivated to read more on logotherapy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62707931-the-cult-of-creativity&quot;&gt;The Cult of Creativity&lt;/a&gt; by Samuel Weil Franklin.  Interesting history on how recently the idea of creativity has entered our thinking, and what a strong corporate background it has.  Kind of ran out of steam, and but worth a quick read.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198276006-i-cheerfully-refuse&quot;&gt;I Cheerfully Refuse&lt;/a&gt; by Leif Enger.  Great tale of loss, adventure, and reawakening.  I also love anything set in the Great Lakes region.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213324913-safecracker&quot;&gt;Safecracker&lt;/a&gt; by Jesse DeRoy.   A solid thriller about a safecracker who gets sucked into a spiraling series of events.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime&quot;&gt;Born a Crime&lt;/a&gt; by Trevor Noah.  Wow, what an upbringing.  How Noah managed to climb from these beginnings is an amazing story.  And somehow still maintains his humor and positivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245583-things-become-other-things&quot;&gt;Things Become Other Things&lt;/a&gt; by Craig Mod.  A travelogue, observations on the changes in a beautiful part of Japan, and a reflection on a long lost friend.  Interesting juxtaposition – admirable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/191746386-the-wide-wide-sea&quot;&gt;The Wide Wide Sea&lt;/a&gt; by Hampton Sides.  The tale of Captain Cook’s final voyage.  Entertaining, and a good look at life on a ship in the 1700s.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird&quot;&gt;Bird By Bird&lt;/a&gt; by Anne Lamott.  Brilliant advice from a writer to writers.  One of the best books on working I have ever read, this is not just about writing.  Progress in anything requires daily attention, willingness to try and fail, constant iteration, and an openness to input and criticism.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61431922-fourth-wing&quot;&gt;Fourth Wing&lt;/a&gt; by Rebecca Yarros.  You know the sort of book – young person goes to a school for magic, much intrigue follows.  More sex than Harry Potter.  Nothing particularly new.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56135066-cecil-rhodes&quot;&gt;Cecil Rhodes: Flawed Colossus&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Roberts.  I did not like this biography.  It treats Rhodes and his contemporaries as almost cartoon characters, with almost comical or farcical behaviour.  I do not believe this is fair or interesting.  Human nature and human IQ has not fundamentally changed over the past 150 years.&lt;/li&gt;

Excellemt book about Apple’s corporate history.   You will be mad at someone after reading this book.   It might be China, it might be Apple, it might be the US government.  Or maybe all 3!&lt;/li&gt;

Solid mystery set in early 1900s – a college friend is killed, his friends all scatter, but find themselves drawn back in 10 years later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20186.Seeing_Like_a_State&quot;&gt;Seeing Like A State&lt;/a&gt; by James C. Scott.  States try some pretty typical and consistent patterns to improve their societies (and to serve the state), and they usually come to ruin.  A little long.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63933641-the-loom-of-time&quot;&gt;The Loom of Time&lt;/a&gt; by Robert D. Kaplan.

Outstanding assessment of the impact of the democratization of information and how it has eroded the legitimacy of authority.  And how the elites in traditional positions of authority (government, party, academia, corporate) are fighting to hang on to their power.  We still have a ways to go before we get to a new stable state in society.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216730681-king-dollar&quot;&gt;King Dollar&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Blustein.  A useful read on the dollar and its role; I would have enjoyed a little more analytical depth.&lt;/li&gt;

Kind of a standard potboiler/thriller. Not much innovation here.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recent Books – Chip War, Morning After the Revolution, A City on Mars, Zero Days, X</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/chip-wars" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recent Books – Chip War, Morning After the Revolution, A City on Mars, Zero Days, X" /><published>2024-12-31T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-12-31T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/chip-wars</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/chip-wars">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321447-chip-war&quot;&gt;Chip War&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Miller.  This was ok, a lot of history I already knew.  A good summary if you want to catxh up with the industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74834673-morning-after-the-revolution&quot;&gt;Morning After the Revolution&lt;/a&gt; by Nellie Bowles.  Hilarious and sad, Bowles rips apart the worst excesses of the progressive movement.&lt;/li&gt;

What a strange book – who is this book for?  The authors are trying for cute I guess, but come across as condescending.  There is a good list here of hard issues around space travel.  And it is certainly going to take a long time to figure out all these issues.  But these authors write like we shouldn’t even try.  I couldn’t finish it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62970022&quot;&gt;Zero Days&lt;/a&gt; by Ruth Ware.  I needed a thriller, this one was dumb.  I get annoyed when clearly smart characters act repeatedly in dumb ways to advance the plot.  I don’t know why I finished it.&lt;/li&gt;

An interesting new perspective on the war for me.  If you accept the book, Stalin played the rest of the Allies like a fiddle to achieve his goals, and there is some truth to that.  I didn’t realize just how generous the US was with lend-lease shipments to the USSR.  That said, I suspect the US was happy to have the USSR bear the brunt of casualties in the war at the expense of some material goods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173754979-james&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; by Percivil Everett.  A fantastic retelling of Huck Finn.  Makes me want to reread the original.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182733784-nuclear-war&quot;&gt;Nuclear War: A Scenario&lt;/a&gt; by Annie Jacobsen.  Oof.  In case you are feeling a little too light and happy this week, pick this up.  Super depressing and even if unlikely, all too likely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2054761.The_Snowball&quot;&gt;The Snowball&lt;/a&gt; by Alice Schroeder.  A biography of Warren Buffet, incredibly boring.  Couldn’t be bothered to finish it.  If you want interesting stuff about Warren Buffet, just read his shareholder letters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75665850-clear-thinking&quot;&gt;Clear Thinking&lt;/a&gt; by Shane Parrish.  Would have been a great long magazine article.  Not really book length material, but a useful framework for thinking more clearly and avoiding common cognitive biases.&lt;/li&gt;

This book gets great reviews, and the premise is compelling, but I gave up 30% of the way in.  I just didn’t care about any of the characters beyond the protagonist, and that wasn’t enough for me.&lt;/li&gt;

I didn’t realize how lax the UK was on money laundering relative to the US.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56791389-dungeon-crawler-carl&quot;&gt;Dungeon Crawler Carl&lt;/a&gt; byMatt Dinniman.  What a stupidly fun book.  Ridiculous, fast-paced, fun.  The whole series is a hoot.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199702772&quot;&gt;All The Worst Humans&lt;/a&gt; by Phil Elwood.  What a great look behidn the scenes of the PR industry.  I know some people don’t like the fact that the author participated all those years in supporting some bad actors, and only now tries to make amends, but it is a great look inside.  Very hard to trust any media!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138505710-doppelganger&quot;&gt;Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World&lt;/a&gt; by Naomi Klein.  An interesting journey into identify and the many ways we see ourselves and others see us. There were some intriguing parts but needed an editor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57030638-woke-inc&quot;&gt;Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam&lt;/a&gt; by Vivek Ramaswamy.  I kind of had to ignore the author name as I read this book.  It is better written and argued than I expected.  However, there are 3 fundamental issues with the book. First, the author complete conflates human venality and corruption with being “woke”.  Humanity has abused power forever, humans are venal and petty and self-interested and will grasp at tools to expand and abuse their power.  That has been going on forever, there is nothing new about it.  Of course in the current world, some will grab the levers of “woke” and use that to their advantage, but it would be some other lever if not that.  So I too get enraged about abuse and corruption, but I don’t lay it on the doorstep of “woke”.  Secondly, the author confuses “woke” and “a\(hole&quot;. There are plenty of a\)holes in the world, and some of them will be for and against some elements of social justice.  It is not an indictment of social justice concepts that there are a\(holes involved with part of it, nor is it a refutation of social justice if anti-&quot;woke&quot; a\)hole faces some consequences.  Finally,  he is very critical of corporations having political views, and critical of money in politcs, but never touches the Citizens United ruling and its implications.  I too might wish that corporations had no politcal voice and that money did not equal speech but that is not the system we have created.  You can’t demand that one behaviour stop while ignoring the root cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207300960-creation-lake&quot;&gt;Creation Lake&lt;/a&gt; by Rachel Kushner.  Yet again a Booker prize nominee that I don’t like. Perhaps it is cleverly and uniquely written, but it is just dull.&lt;/li&gt;

A very very high level introduction to cosmology and topology.  And a nice introspective tale of the author’s life and growth.  Very enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195790867-moonbound&quot;&gt;Moonbound&lt;/a&gt; by Robin Sloan.  There are a few books that let you peek into a vast strange world and have a fun adventure, and hint at much much more.  The Hobbit was one of those books for me.  This is another.  A fascinating world, a classic hero’s tale, just a lot of fun.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37922709-on-desperate-ground&quot;&gt;On Desperate Ground&lt;/a&gt; by Hampton Sides.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40265841-finding-dorothy&quot;&gt;Finding Dorothy&lt;/a&gt; by Elizabeth Letts.  I am on the fence here.   I did finish the book, but I never really felt like I found Dorothy.  There is a story in here somewhere about how Dorothy is a representation of the women in Baum’s life, but it never quite clicked for me.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60372350-steel-fear&quot;&gt;Steel Fear&lt;/a&gt; by Brandon Webb and John David Mann.  Super fun thriller, reminds me a little of the Alistair MacLean books I loved as a kid, only more modern and better depth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389431-seven-blades-in-black&quot;&gt;Seven Blades in Black&lt;/a&gt; by Sam Sykes.  So I enjoyed this as escapist fare, but it is annoying that every chapter seems to feature an even more fearsome enemy, and the hero discovers a power every chapter that just happens to top that enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
