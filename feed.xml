And that is a shame, because writing is the best way to cement your learning, to tease out your thinking, and to kickstart engagement with others.  I see people that set goals to write 1000 words a day.  A high bar but a good one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just are wrapping up a remodelling project.  Top of mind this week is all the smart tech in the home and the attention they demand.  Every appliance and device maker has the central idea that their device is the most important device ever, and that you should dedicate your day to admiring it and servicing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Washers and dryers with their loud “cycle finished” alarms, because of course nothing is more important in my day that knowing when a cycle finishes, especially at 10 PM in the middle of a movie, or at 1 AM when you are in bed.  And the UX to turn off the alarm is goooooofy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dishwashers with “cycle finished” alarm to rival the smoke alarm in persistence, they just go on and on and on.  THe manufacturer did so much work to make the dishwasher itself quiet, only to blare an alarm saying “I’m Done!!!  Come Celebrate!!  NOW NOW NOW!!”.  And again the UX to turn off is terrible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smart thermostats that want to be the star of the room – big black obelisks with garish color displays.  Most homeowners want their thermostats to disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The smart vacuum with the speaker and voice that yells at me at 1AM to “plug me in now” because it wasn’t seated right on the charger.  I just about wet my pants that night.  I have a smart vacuum because I don’t want to think about vacuuming, not because I want to be yelled at by a vacuum.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OK the “you left the fridge door open” alarm is sensible and I am glad for that one.  But it is the exception.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The smart doorbell that by default sends you an alert for every motion at your door – so god forbid your doorbell camera faces the street or trees or something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all the manufacturers recognize that the phone is a key part of everyone’s life, so they all build their own apps for their devices.  They don’t embrace Homekit or other standards, because they want to own the relationship with the consumer.  So you get a flotilla of apps, each with their own UX and object model and interaction style and notification control.  Some are beyond goofy.  I have a whole page of them on my phone now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think any of us really want a refrigerator app and a stovetop app and a icemaker app and a thermostat app (three in my house because we have Trane and Honeywell thermostats and a minisplit!)  We really want a home app and everything to click into it, and a common way to control notifications, to group things, to automate, etc.  I’m a nerd so I of course install all the apps, but the regular humans in my household want nothing to do with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these separate apps do not build the brand loyalty that the manufacturers want – every time I have to run the Honeywell app, it is time lost, and it just reminds me what jerks the Honeywell product managers are and how little they think of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of this mess is because there is no established practice of system architecture in the home.  We have great architects who think thru the physical design of the house and the mechanical systems.  But I am not seeing the same leadership in digital and electrical infrastructure in the home.  We have a jumble of security, audio, cat6, low voltage, and other wiring.  A jumble of wireless protocols for data, for proprietary security and control systems.  A jumble of apps,  jumble of logins and accounts and cloud services  There is no design here.  The architects and contractors leave it up to subcontractors who just jam stuff in.  It is all a little embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">(An aside – I have let my writing lapse due to other projects in the last 6 months.

A bit dense but a very good analysis of country development in Asia – what has worked, what has failed.  A lot of excellent analysis of the policies that led to success in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.   I loved this line – “At the industrial policy-making level, what stands out with the benefit of hindsight is that there was almost no role played in Japan, Korea, or Taiwan by economists.”  Most of the advice by big-brained western consultants and agencies has been dead wrong.&lt;/li&gt;

Wow this is a lot of J. Edgar Hoover info.  He was certainly a central figure in the 20th century.  A sobering story about the accumulation of power, and the abuse of power, by him and by politicians around him.  We are not well served by elected or appointed officials with long terms.&lt;/li&gt;

Another blood boiler.  Very difficult to be positive about alliance with Saudi Arabia after reading this.  Also makes me even more pro-renewables so that we can stop dealing with these turds.&lt;/li&gt;

A man struggles for meaning and faith over the course of a life in which he loses his brother, first love, his wife, his parents, his daughter. And somehow de Vries injects levity in the story.  Great admiration for the writing.&lt;/li&gt;

A little histrionic at times, and overly long and repetitive, but raises good issues.  There is a glaring hole in the recommendations, there is no way we can depend on inspections of manufacturing facilities in the US or overseas to ensure quality, we have to perform random sample testing of product in the field and take fast action based on problems identified.&lt;/li&gt;

Really liked it.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My Top 6 Books</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/top-five" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My Top 6 Books" /><published>2022-11-25T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-11-25T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/top-five</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/top-five">&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Holiday-Books-2022&quot;&gt;posted some of his favorite books&lt;/a&gt;.  And it has inspired me to think about my all time favorites.  I have 1200+ books listed on Goodreads and I am sure there are another 500-1000 I’ve read that I have never put on Goodreads (for instance, I read every Allen Drury political drama back in my teens, loved them, but I’ve never bothered to put on Goodreads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I narrowed my list down to 6 with some alternates as well.  (Sorry I couldn’t get to 5, Bill is better at this than I am)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/378.The_Phantom_Tollbooth&quot;&gt;The Phantom Tollbooth&lt;/a&gt; by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer.  This book hooked me on reading as a young reader, I loved the story and the wordplay.  It is probably not a great adult book read but I think it is fabulous for young readers.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17157681-the-hobbit-part-one&quot;&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/a&gt; is of course a great choice as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama&quot;&gt;Rendezvous with Rama&lt;/a&gt; by Arthur C. Clarke.  I read a ton of classic science fiction and I loved much of it.  Rama really had a sense of mystery and wonder that I enjoyed.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234225.Dune&quot;&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion&quot;&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt; are great books in the genre as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423.The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness&quot;&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; by Ursula K. Leguin.  I love all of Leguin’s works, this book showed me that speculative fiction could be so much deeper.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/334176.The_Sparrow&quot;&gt;The Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent choice too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1138543.The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England&quot;&gt;The Strange Death of Liberal England&lt;/a&gt; by George Dangerfield.  One of my favorite history books about a period of great change, just so well written. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1128055.Hitler_s_Thirty_Days_to_Power&quot;&gt;Hitler’s Thirty Days to Power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50159458-kent-state&quot;&gt;Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio&lt;/a&gt; are excellent choices as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262304.The_Wild_Party&quot;&gt;The Wild Party&lt;/a&gt; by Joseph Moncure March with illustrations by Art Spiegelman.  A quirky little piece of fiction that I find incredibly entertaining.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11149.The_Screwtape_Letters&quot;&gt;The Screwtape Letters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288259-dear-committee-members&quot;&gt;Dear Committee Members&lt;/a&gt; are fun choices too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54218.The_Mismeasure_of_Man&quot;&gt;The Mismeasure of Man&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Jay Gould.  All of Gould’s work is excellent, this set of analyses is well argued and well written.  Other good non-fiction choices are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month&quot;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35187180-the-death-and-life-of-the-great-lakes&quot;&gt;The Death and Life of the Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy&quot;&gt;Good Strategy, Bad Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan&quot;&gt;The Black Swan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17884043-tune-in&quot;&gt;Tune In&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56985443-her-name-is-knight&quot;&gt;Her Name Is Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59132250-they-come-at-knight&quot;&gt;They Come At Knight&lt;/a&gt; by Yasmin Angoe.  The first book is a good start to a thriller series featuring a young African assassin who has been thru a hellacious early life, and is now starting to avenge herself.  The tale continues int he second book, which loses its way for a little while, although ends well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61640141-the-pyramid-of-lies&quot;&gt;The Pyramid of Lies: Lex Greensill and the Billion-Dollar Scandal&lt;/a&gt; by Duncan Mavin.  More detail than I really wanted on this scandal.  I am excited to read the equivalent about Sam Bankman-Fried some day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59028343-spin&quot;&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Charles Wilson.  Great tale of three close friends who deal with the transformation of Earth by alien technologies.  Great characters dealing with stress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29044.The_Secret_History&quot;&gt;The Secret History&lt;/a&gt; by Donna Tartt.  This book seems well written, but the characters are unpleasant and the situation is unpleasant and I just didn’t enjoy putting this into my head.  Moving on.&lt;/li&gt;
