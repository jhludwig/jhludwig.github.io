&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win... -- &lt;i&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part is how this will bring out the best of our energies and skills.  An aspirational goal can really pull people together – the challenge displaces the petty everyday tussles we stumble into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve the moon goal, the US government made significant investments in science and technology.  DARPA was founded in 1958, motivated by Sputnik, and was instrumental in the race to the moon, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA&quot;&gt;has continued to generate incredible impact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;
The Economist has called DARPA the agency &quot;that shaped the modern world,&quot; and pointed out that &quot;Moderna’s covid-19 vaccine sits alongside weather satellites, GPS, drones, stealth technology, voice interfaces, the personal computer and the internet on the list of innovations for which DARPA can claim at least partial credit.&quot; Its track record of success has inspired governments around the world to launch similar research and development agencies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed as a venture investor, DARPA and other government investments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profgalloway.com/welfare-queens/&quot;&gt;have been the best investments we’ve ever made&lt;/a&gt;, far outpacing the impact of private venture capital:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;
One investor funded the computer, the internet, speech recognition, last-mile distribution, mapping the human genome, the core technologies of fracking, and the first horizontal shale drill, and today it’s driving down the cost of solar and wind power below that of coal. -- &lt;i&gt;Scott Galloway&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now face new sputnik-like challenges – innovation that is critical to future economic development, but where the US is failing to keep pace with other nations, now China. Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-war-economy-is-america-falling&quot;&gt;our (potential) science gap with China&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;
Well, the point should be obvious now. When China has quantum computers a million times faster than Google’s, satellites that can talk securely with the Earth via quantum entanglement, quantum magnetometers that can (possibly) find our most secret submarines, and autonomous drone swarms that can fly through dense forests, Congress would have to be insane to worry about pinching a few pennies. -- &lt;i&gt;Noah Smith&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to this challenge will generate new industries and new jobs for our children, just as DARPA did.  Failing to respond will result in high value industries shifting to other nations, dragging down the ability of US citizens to enjoy a high standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad to see the US has recently passed laws supporting semiconductor investment and renewables investment.  Those are probably key industries going forward. But we haven’t articulated a moonshot goal.  And we need one to help us all rise above the daily squabbles and focus on a positive future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the right moonshot goal is, but it is not the Inflation Reduction Act – too prosaic, doesn’t lift us up.  And it is not a Green New Deal – too abstract, too diffuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been reflecting on JFK’s “We choose to go to the Moon” speech:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recent Books – Fooled by the Winners, Polarized, Vanishing Asia, Broken Glass, Will to Kill</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/fooled" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recent Books – Fooled by the Winners, Polarized, Vanishing Asia, Broken Glass, Will to Kill" /><published>2022-08-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-08-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/fooled</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/fooled">&lt;ul&gt;

The parts of this book that went into survivor bias were decent, but marred by the midbook tangent off into climate change and our potential responses to it.  I don’t necessarily disagree with much (but not all) of the author’s view on climate change, but it just derailed the whole book, and the pages could have been better spent digging into survivor bias examples and implications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52098718-why-we-re-polarized&quot;&gt;Why We’re Polarized&lt;/a&gt; by Ezra Klein. Good assessment of the state and causes of polarization. Highest recommendation, I learned a lot.  One insight about our changing demographics for instance – political power shifts lag 10 years behind demographic shifts, while cultural shifts lead by 10 years.  This alone creates a lot of stress in our society.  Also interesting is how the parties both basically abdicated control of candidate selection to the popular vote, and the implications of that change.  A ton of good stuff.&lt;/li&gt;

A moderately entertaining detective tale with a twist, the main character is beset by a crippling disease (spinal muscular atrophy) and is fighting to make something of their own life.  An easy read.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57699025-city-of-orange&quot;&gt;City of Orange&lt;/a&gt; by David Yoon.

Big hat tip to everyone involved and to the State of Washington for making vote-by-mail so easy and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 18 choices in the Senate primary.  I’ve read about them all.  I’ve gone to all their websites if provided.  And it is a sorry set of choices in front of us.  How is it that we have such lame choices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first have a bunch of non-serious choices.  These candidates haven’t bothered to create websites, they have hotmail.com and yahoo.com and gmail.com addresses, there is often no way to give them money, and they have fringe or even nutty views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Henry Clay Dennison.  Socialist Worker’s Party.  Some great working class background, and wants to stand up for the common man.  But then he veers off into support for Cuba’s socialist revolution, which I doubt is a big issue for most Washington voters, and he declares that he wants a “revolutionary government of workers and farmers”.  I’m feeling Cultural Revolution vibes here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mohammad Hassan Said.  Democrat.  A yahoo.com email address so he couldn’t be bothered to try very hard.  Oh and his medical license was suspended and apparently “a member of LGBT” was involved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dan Phan Doan.  Independent.  No website.  No stand on issues.  Feels like some friends entered his name to surprise him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dr. Pano Churchill.  Democrat.  He’s the elected leader of the environmental parliament and the independent Lincoln Party!  He says some nice things in his campaign statement.  His website is a deep mishmash of stuff, I am sure there is something that would terrify me in here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sam Cusmir.  Democrat.  No history of office.  His website doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jon Butler.  Independent.  He points you to his facebook page which is filled with pretty random and suspect links.  And he has a hotmail email address.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bryan Solstin.  Democrat.  A Bitcoin enthusiast! “Central Bank Digital Coin is slave money.  Dystopian”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Martin D. Hash.  Independent.  “the only-ever simultaneously licensed doctor, lawyer, accountant &amp;amp; Professional Engineer in the world.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thor Amundson.  Independent  “Professional Experience: Watching C-Span for 30 years”.  No website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charlie (Chuck) Jackson.  Independent.  His campaign website is a long screed at insanityrules.org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two Republicans who don’t seem to be Trumpy but who basically have no chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bill Hirt.  Republican.  Website solely focused on stopping mass transit expansion and on climate change denial.  I am not sure he understands what Senators do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;John Guenther.  Republican.  No history of office, refuses all donations.  I admire his spirit but this isn’t serious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have three Trumpy Republican candidates with various degrees of Trumpiness.  All unelectable in this state.  I can live with some conservative positions but the embrace of the Trump camp and the election integrity nonsense is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leon Lawson, Trump Republican Party, an entity that doesn’t exist?  Big MAGA energy on his website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dave Saulibio.  JFK Republican Party?  An entity that doesn’t exist. A big fan of giving teachers guns and hardening schools.  Admires Trump.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiffany Smiley, Republican.  Endorsed by a bunch of people in the Trumpublican circles, happy about the RoeVWade decision, some blather about election integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Democrats or Independents who seem to have their hearts mostly in the right place but have no experience, little organization, and some policy flaws:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Naz Paul. Independent.  No history of office.  An attempt at a good campaign website tho a little silent on some of the most fractious issues of the day like abortion, hard to know what she really stands for.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ravin Pierre.  Democrat.  A history of service, strong educational background, he seems to have his heart in the right place, tho he is a little out of control on his language sometime.  And has some pretty radical positions on church taxation, crypto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally Patty Murray, the incumbent Democrat.  I am disappointed in how invisible our incumbent Senators have been over the last 6 years.  We have faced incredible challenges and I see no leadership from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a pretty disappointing slate.  I’m left with little choice but to support the largely invisible and ineffective incumbent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been reading my offical voter’s pamphlet which is a great resource.

The early chapters are great, really explains the centrality of energy costs in the bulk of the world around us, and how hard it is going to be to move away from fossil fuels.

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I reconsidered my use of Facebook, and made the decision to largely exit Facebook, and I haven’t really regretted it.  I’ve been doing the same recently for Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do get value out of Twitter.  College football smack talk and news, a little bit of community news, some technology info, the occasional news about friends.  But there is a lot of noise on Twitter, a lot of snark, a lot of “performative nonsense”, and maybe it is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I expect out of Twitter?  Twitter is not some mystical thing.  It’s not our global conciousness, not our townsquare, not some magic public good.  It’s just a company trying to turn a buck by attracting eyeballs.  Viewing it as some special thing just leads to disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has every right to publish/promote whatever content using whatever criteria it wants.  The choice may attract or drive away some users, may attract advertisers or not, may have other business implications.  Whatever, that is the Twitter’s first amendment right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter also doesn’t owe me or anyone a bullhorn.  It may or may not let me say what I want to say, Twitter may or may not amplify it.  That is Twitter’s right.   And I have the right to use or not use Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any new owner of Twitter will have the right to publish and promote whatever content they want, using whatever criteria they want.   It may be different than what the former owners did.  It may have different appeal to different users, advertisers, partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I don’t like any of that, I can walk away at anytime.  No one is forcing me to use Twitter.  I can live without it — most of my family doesn’t regularly use Twitter, most of them don’t even have accounts.   Twitter doesn’t have particularly significant impacts on my work performance or on my relationships.  If and when it loses the entertainment, social, and educational value it has, I will just walk away.   There are plenty of places to read, to learn, to share, to connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, Instead of cruising Twitter every morning and worrying about what it might become, I’ve been spending time on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/learn&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, trying to relearn my high school Spanish.  I feel better after doing this than I have ever felt after spending time on Twitter.  I will probably continue to drift away from Twitter towards more learning, thinking, and positive communication venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;progressive-buyers-guide&quot;&gt;Progressive Buyer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the Progressive Voter’s Guide (&lt;a href=&quot;https://progressivevotersguide.com&quot;&gt;https://progressivevotersguide.com&lt;/a&gt;).  It is not my sole source of voting info, but it is a very helpful and concise guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like the sustainable seafood guide (&lt;a href=&quot;https://oceana.org/living-blue-sustainable-seafood-guide/&quot;&gt;https://oceana.org/living-blue-sustainable-seafood-guide/&lt;/a&gt;).  When I have useful info on products and their impact, I like to make the most beneficial choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had a Progressive Buyer’s Guide.  When I go to buy a car, or book a trip, or buy an appliance, or subscribe to a service, or whatever — where is that money going?  What political efforts are supported by that company or by its principals?  What states are benefiting most from my expenditure?  Do I have alternatives available that would direct money towards more progressive states or more progressive political efforts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I found out this year that, not only had ATT and ATT executives donated to Republican candidates, but ATT helped to fund the establishment of the right wing OAN news network.  I don’t need to fund that.  I happily made the switch to T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some elements I would want as part of an effort to build a progressive buyer’s guide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A system to track a product’s source by state, company.  What % of this car is produced in what state (or finer grained region) by what company?  I’d want to support community involvement, ultimately will want to tap a network of people providing this info.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A system to track a company’s donations and the donations of executives.  Most of this is already public at the FEC website or Opensecrets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A progressive weighting of states, politicians, PACs, etc, and an algorithm to sum those into a total weighting for a product.  It is likely that one would want to support multiple ratings — IE a total progressive rating, a climate change rating, an income inequality rating, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A front end to display a weighting for a product.  And for a given product, show the more progressive alternatives.  You want a certain suv?   This alternative has more content produced in more progressive states, and the execs give less to retrogressive candidates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;random&quot;&gt;Random&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://steampipe.io&quot;&gt;Steampipe.io&lt;/a&gt; – a sql interface on top of all kinds of cloud resources.  Kind of cool.  As Sam says, software engineers love grand unification schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this era of heightened political conflict, why are the US Senators from the state of Washington so nearly invisbile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not like pickles.  But I have great admiration for the pickle lobby who have somehow convinced everyone to put pickles with every sandwich ever.&lt;/p&gt;

I have sometimes handwaved in some presentations, but I am a handwaving amateur.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Well it has been a while since I have posted any observations.

Some parts of this were great.  The central idea that company failure is a lot more common than success, and that you should have an investment strategy which embraces that, is a good idea, though I don’t have the appetite for risk required (tho maybe I should invest in a short fund).  His portrayal of short sellers as the true heroes of our economy is a bit of a stretch.&lt;/li&gt;

Fantastic.  Parts of this may antagonize you, and he may go further on some points than I accept, but a well argued and passionate examination.  You have to appreciate his voice and vigor.&lt;/li&gt;
