So much bad news and misbehavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wow, do I feel optimistic this week.  Like so many people I’ve been playing around with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stability.ai&quot;&gt;Stable Diffusion&lt;/a&gt;, and to a lesser extent Midjourney and Dall-E 2. Tons of fun, the open nature of Stable Diffusion makes it easy to play with, I’m reminded of how much fun it was the first time I got a PC.  And the rate of innovation around it is incredible – a &lt;a href=&quot;https://keras.io/guides/keras_cv/generate_images_with_stable_diffusion/&quot;&gt;KerasCV port&lt;/a&gt; which seems super fast, alternative web UIs like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&quot;&gt;Automatic1111&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deforum/stable-diffusion&quot;&gt;animation&lt;/a&gt; aupport, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nateraw/stable-diffusion-videos&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; applications, tools to do incremental training for new objects and styles, prompt generation tools, landscape generation tools, inpainting, outpainting, masking, mosaicing, audio equivalents – it is hard to keep up with everything.  Incredibly exciting time, great energy.  Lots of issues around copyright and IP protection to be figured out, but still super exciting.  I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lspace.swyx.io/p/multiverse-not-metaverse&quot;&gt;this phrasing&lt;/a&gt; – the creative multiverse is way more exciting than some corporate metaverse.  Stable Diffusion and its kin are going to be major accelerants for every creative task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I see reasons for great optimism outside software.  I am relatively stupid about things biologic, but I get pretty excited when I read articles like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tsungxu.com/performance-biomaterials&quot;&gt;Biomanufactured Materials Are Coming&lt;/a&gt;.  Imagine if we can create Moore’s Law equivalents for biologic materials – ever cheaper, ever higher volume, ever more function biologics – the applications are pretty endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then look at the space industry – &lt;a href=&quot;https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_Briefing_2022_Q2.pdf&quot;&gt;Launch volumes are going way up, costs are going way down&lt;/a&gt;.  And there are a ton of companies working hard to make this happen faster – for instance &lt;a href=&quot;stokespace.com&quot;&gt;Stoke Space&lt;/a&gt;.  Getting the free market to work on this challenge has been brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could probably get just as excited about the declining cost of renewable energy and the implications of much cheaper energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like we are on the cusp of an explosion of creativity fed by all these advances.  A great time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It is easy to be concerned about the nation and the world.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;
We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win... -- &lt;i&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part is how this will bring out the best of our energies and skills.  An aspirational goal can really pull people together – the challenge displaces the petty everyday tussles we stumble into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve the moon goal, the US government made significant investments in science and technology.  DARPA was founded in 1958, motivated by Sputnik, and was instrumental in the race to the moon, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA&quot;&gt;has continued to generate incredible impact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;
The Economist has called DARPA the agency &quot;that shaped the modern world,&quot; and pointed out that &quot;Moderna’s covid-19 vaccine sits alongside weather satellites, GPS, drones, stealth technology, voice interfaces, the personal computer and the internet on the list of innovations for which DARPA can claim at least partial credit.&quot; Its track record of success has inspired governments around the world to launch similar research and development agencies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed as a venture investor, DARPA and other government investments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profgalloway.com/welfare-queens/&quot;&gt;have been the best investments we’ve ever made&lt;/a&gt;, far outpacing the impact of private venture capital:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;
One investor funded the computer, the internet, speech recognition, last-mile distribution, mapping the human genome, the core technologies of fracking, and the first horizontal shale drill, and today it’s driving down the cost of solar and wind power below that of coal. -- &lt;i&gt;Scott Galloway&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now face new sputnik-like challenges – innovation that is critical to future economic development, but where the US is failing to keep pace with other nations, now China. Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-war-economy-is-america-falling&quot;&gt;our (potential) science gap with China&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:medium&quot;&gt;
Well, the point should be obvious now. When China has quantum computers a million times faster than Google’s, satellites that can talk securely with the Earth via quantum entanglement, quantum magnetometers that can (possibly) find our most secret submarines, and autonomous drone swarms that can fly through dense forests, Congress would have to be insane to worry about pinching a few pennies. -- &lt;i&gt;Noah Smith&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to this challenge will generate new industries and new jobs for our children, just as DARPA did.  Failing to respond will result in high value industries shifting to other nations, dragging down the ability of US citizens to enjoy a high standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad to see the US has recently passed laws supporting semiconductor investment and renewables investment.  Those are probably key industries going forward. But we haven’t articulated a moonshot goal.  And we need one to help us all rise above the daily squabbles and focus on a positive future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the right moonshot goal is, but it is not the Inflation Reduction Act – too prosaic, doesn’t lift us up.  And it is not a Green New Deal – too abstract, too diffuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been reflecting on JFK’s “We choose to go to the Moon” speech:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recent Books – Fooled by the Winners, Polarized, Vanishing Asia, Broken Glass, Will to Kill</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/fooled" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recent Books – Fooled by the Winners, Polarized, Vanishing Asia, Broken Glass, Will to Kill" /><published>2022-08-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-08-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/fooled</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/fooled">&lt;ul&gt;

The parts of this book that went into survivor bias were decent, but marred by the midbook tangent off into climate change and our potential responses to it.  I don’t necessarily disagree with much (but not all) of the author’s view on climate change, but it just derailed the whole book, and the pages could have been better spent digging into survivor bias examples and implications.&lt;/li&gt;

Good assessment of the state and causes of polarization. Highest recommendation, I learned a lot.  One insight about our changing demographics for instance – political power shifts lag 10 years behind demographic shifts, while cultural shifts lead by 10 years.  This alone creates a lot of stress in our society.  Also interesting is how the parties both basically abdicated control of candidate selection to the popular vote, and the implications of that change.  A ton of good stuff.&lt;/li&gt;

Big hat tip to everyone involved and to the State of Washington for making vote-by-mail so easy and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 18 choices in the Senate primary.  I’ve read about them all.  I’ve gone to all their websites if provided.  And it is a sorry set of choices in front of us.  How is it that we have such lame choices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first have a bunch of non-serious choices.  These candidates haven’t bothered to create websites, they have hotmail.com and yahoo.com and gmail.com addresses, there is often no way to give them money, and they have fringe or even nutty views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Henry Clay Dennison.  Socialist Worker’s Party.  Some great working class background, and wants to stand up for the common man.  But then he veers off into support for Cuba’s socialist revolution, which I doubt is a big issue for most Washington voters, and he declares that he wants a “revolutionary government of workers and farmers”.  I’m feeling Cultural Revolution vibes here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mohammad Hassan Said.  Democrat.  A yahoo.com email address so he couldn’t be bothered to try very hard.  Oh and his medical license was suspended and apparently “a member of LGBT” was involved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dan Phan Doan.  Independent.  No website.  No stand on issues.  Feels like some friends entered his name to surprise him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dr. Pano Churchill.  Democrat.  He’s the elected leader of the environmental parliament and the independent Lincoln Party!  He says some nice things in his campaign statement.  His website is a deep mishmash of stuff, I am sure there is something that would terrify me in here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sam Cusmir.  Democrat.  No history of office.  His website doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jon Butler.  Independent.  He points you to his facebook page which is filled with pretty random and suspect links.  And he has a hotmail email address.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bryan Solstin.  Democrat.  A Bitcoin enthusiast! “Central Bank Digital Coin is slave money.  Dystopian”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Martin D. Hash.  Independent.  “the only-ever simultaneously licensed doctor, lawyer, accountant &amp;amp; Professional Engineer in the world.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thor Amundson.  Independent  “Professional Experience: Watching C-Span for 30 years”.  No website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charlie (Chuck) Jackson.  Independent.  His campaign website is a long screed at insanityrules.org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two Republicans who don’t seem to be Trumpy but who basically have no chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bill Hirt.  Republican.  Website solely focused on stopping mass transit expansion and on climate change denial.  I am not sure he understands what Senators do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;John Guenther.  Republican.  No history of office, refuses all donations.  I admire his spirit but this isn’t serious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have three Trumpy Republican candidates with various degrees of Trumpiness.  All unelectable in this state.  I can live with some conservative positions but the embrace of the Trump camp and the election integrity nonsense is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leon Lawson, Trump Republican Party, an entity that doesn’t exist?  Big MAGA energy on his website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dave Saulibio.  JFK Republican Party?  An entity that doesn’t exist. A big fan of giving teachers guns and hardening schools.  Admires Trump.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiffany Smiley, Republican.  Endorsed by a bunch of people in the Trumpublican circles, happy about the RoeVWade decision, some blather about election integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Democrats or Independents who seem to have their hearts mostly in the right place but have no experience, little organization, and some policy flaws:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Naz Paul. Independent.  No history of office.  An attempt at a good campaign website tho a little silent on some of the most fractious issues of the day like abortion, hard to know what she really stands for.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ravin Pierre.  Democrat.  A history of service, strong educational background, he seems to have his heart in the right place, tho he is a little out of control on his language sometime.  And has some pretty radical positions on church taxation, crypto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally Patty Murray, the incumbent Democrat.  I am disappointed in how invisible our incumbent Senators have been over the last 6 years.  We have faced incredible challenges and I see no leadership from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a pretty disappointing slate.  I’m left with little choice but to support the largely invisible and ineffective incumbent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been reading my offical voter’s pamphlet which is a great resource.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56587388-how-the-world-really-works&quot;&gt;How The World Really Works&lt;/a&gt; by Vaclav Smil.  Recommended to me by a lot of smart people. The early chapters are great, really explains the centrality of energy costs in the bulk of the world around us, and how hard it is going to be to move away from fossil fuels.  The later chapters seemed to meander and the book lost its edge, but the core point of “you have to understand the world before you can start changing it” is extremely valid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59788687-border-hacker&quot;&gt;Border Hacker&lt;/a&gt; by Levi Vonk.  The story of a migrants and a particular migrant attempting to get to the US through Mexico.  A terrible experience made worse by US policies.  I would have enjoyed more stories of more individuals, and less focus on the one individual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59219568-the-recruit&quot;&gt;The Recruit&lt;/a&gt; by Alan Drew.  A solid thriller about racism in the 80s, themes that sadly remain relevant today.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54396808-unstoppable&quot;&gt;Unstoppable: Siggi B. Wilzig’s Astonishing Journey from Auschwitz Survivor and Penniless Immigrant to Wall Street Legend&lt;/a&gt; by Joshua M. Greene.  Pretty amazing story of survival and fortitude.  Very inspiring.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59577183-shifty-s-boys&quot;&gt;Shifty’s Boys&lt;/a&gt; byt Chris Offutt.  Good thriller set in appalachia, seems to nail the atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
