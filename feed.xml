Big hat tip to everyone involved and to the State of Washington for making vote-by-mail so easy and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 18 choices in the Senate primary.  I’ve read about them all.  I’ve gone to all their websites if provided.  And it is a sorry set of choices in front of us.  How is it that we have such lame choices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first have a bunch of non-serious choices.  These candidates haven’t bothered to create websites, they have hotmail.com and yahoo.com and gmail.com addresses, there is often no way to give them money, and they have fringe or even nutty views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Henry Clay Dennison.  Socialist Worker’s Party.  Some great working class background, and wants to stand up for the common man.  But then he veers off into support for Cuba’s socialist revolution, which I doubt is a big issue for most Washington voters, and he declares that he wants a “revolutionary government of workers and farmers”.  I’m feeling Cultural Revolution vibes here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mohammad Hassan Said.  Democrat.  A yahoo.com email address so he couldn’t be bothered to try very hard.  Oh and his medical license was suspended and apparently “a member of LGBT” was involved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dan Phan Doan.  Independent.  No website.  No stand on issues.  Feels like some friends entered his name to surprise him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dr. Pano Churchill.  Democrat.  He’s the elected leader of the environmental parliament and the independent Lincoln Party!  He says some nice things in his campaign statement.  His website is a deep mishmash of stuff, I am sure there is something that would terrify me in here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sam Cusmir.  Democrat.  No history of office.  His website doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jon Butler.  Independent.  He points you to his facebook page which is filled with pretty random and suspect links.  And he has a hotmail email address.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bryan Solstin.  Democrat.  A Bitcoin enthusiast! “Central Bank Digital Coin is slave money.  Dystopian”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Martin D. Hash.  Independent.  “the only-ever simultaneously licensed doctor, lawyer, accountant &amp;amp; Professional Engineer in the world.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thor Amundson.  Independent  “Professional Experience: Watching C-Span for 30 years”.  No website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Charlie (Chuck) Jackson.  Independent.  His campaign website is a long screed at insanityrules.org.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two Republicans who don’t seem to be Trumpy but who basically have no chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bill Hirt.  Republican.  Website solely focused on stopping mass transit expansion and on climate change denial.  I am not sure he understands what Senators do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;John Guenther.  Republican.  No history of office, refuses all donations.  I admire his spirit but this isn’t serious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have three Trumpy Republican candidates with various degrees of Trumpiness.  All unelectable in this state.  I can live with some conservative positions but the embrace of the Trump camp and the election integrity nonsense is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leon Lawson, Trump Republican Party, an entity that doesn’t exist?  Big MAGA energy on his website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dave Saulibio.  JFK Republican Party?  An entity that doesn’t exist. A big fan of giving teachers guns and hardening schools.  Admires Trump.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiffany Smiley, Republican.  Endorsed by a bunch of people in the Trumpublican circles, happy about the RoeVWade decision, some blather about election integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Democrats or Independents who seem to have their hearts mostly in the right place but have no experience, little organization, and some policy flaws:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Naz Paul. Independent.  No history of office.  An attempt at a good campaign website tho a little silent on some of the most fractious issues of the day like abortion, hard to know what she really stands for.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ravin Pierre.  Democrat.  A history of service, strong educational background, he seems to have his heart in the right place, tho he is a little out of control on his language sometime.  And has some pretty radical positions on church taxation, crypto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally Patty Murray, the incumbent Democrat.  I am disappointed in how invisible our incumbent Senators have been over the last 6 years.  We have faced incredible challenges and I see no leadership from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a pretty disappointing slate.  I’m left with little choice but to support the largely invisible and ineffective incumbent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been reading my offical voter’s pamphlet which is a great resource.

Recommended to me by a lot of smart people. The early chapters are great, really explains the centrality of energy costs in the bulk of the world around us, and how hard it is going to be to move away from fossil fuels.  The later chapters seemed to meander and the book lost its edge, but the core point of “you have to understand the world before you can start changing it” is extremely valid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59788687-border-hacker&quot;&gt;Border Hacker&lt;/a&gt; by Levi Vonk.  The story of a migrants and a particular migrant attempting to get to the US through Mexico.  A terrible experience made worse by US policies.  I would have enjoyed more stories of more individuals, and less focus on the one individual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59219568-the-recruit&quot;&gt;The Recruit&lt;/a&gt; by Alan Drew.  A solid thriller about racism in the 80s, themes that sadly remain relevant today.&lt;/li&gt;

I have improved my pickleball game tho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I reconsidered my use of Facebook, and made the decision to largely exit Facebook, and I haven’t really regretted it.  I’ve been doing the same recently for Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do get value out of Twitter.  College football smack talk and news, a little bit of community news, some technology info, the occasional news about friends.  But there is a lot of noise on Twitter, a lot of snark, a lot of “performative nonsense”, and maybe it is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I expect out of Twitter?  Twitter is not some mystical thing.  It’s not our global conciousness, not our townsquare, not some magic public good.  It’s just a company trying to turn a buck by attracting eyeballs.  Viewing it as some special thing just leads to disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has every right to publish/promote whatever content using whatever criteria it wants.  The choice may attract or drive away some users, may attract advertisers or not, may have other business implications.  Whatever, that is the Twitter’s first amendment right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter also doesn’t owe me or anyone a bullhorn.  It may or may not let me say what I want to say, Twitter may or may not amplify it.  That is Twitter’s right.   And I have the right to use or not use Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any new owner of Twitter will have the right to publish and promote whatever content they want, using whatever criteria they want.   It may be different than what the former owners did.  It may have different appeal to different users, advertisers, partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I don’t like any of that, I can walk away at anytime.  No one is forcing me to use Twitter.  I can live without it — most of my family doesn’t regularly use Twitter, most of them don’t even have accounts.   Twitter doesn’t have particularly significant impacts on my work performance or on my relationships.  If and when it loses the entertainment, social, and educational value it has, I will just walk away.   There are plenty of places to read, to learn, to share, to connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, Instead of cruising Twitter every morning and worrying about what it might become, I’ve been spending time on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/learn&quot;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, trying to relearn my high school Spanish.  I feel better after doing this than I have ever felt after spending time on Twitter.  I will probably continue to drift away from Twitter towards more learning, thinking, and positive communication venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;progressive-buyers-guide&quot;&gt;Progressive Buyer’s Guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the Progressive Voter’s Guide (&lt;a href=&quot;https://progressivevotersguide.com&quot;&gt;https://progressivevotersguide.com&lt;/a&gt;).  It is not my sole source of voting info, but it is a very helpful and concise guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like the sustainable seafood guide (&lt;a href=&quot;https://oceana.org/living-blue-sustainable-seafood-guide/&quot;&gt;https://oceana.org/living-blue-sustainable-seafood-guide/&lt;/a&gt;).  When I have useful info on products and their impact, I like to make the most beneficial choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had a Progressive Buyer’s Guide.  When I go to buy a car, or book a trip, or buy an appliance, or subscribe to a service, or whatever — where is that money going?  What political efforts are supported by that company or by its principals?  What states are benefiting most from my expenditure?  Do I have alternatives available that would direct money towards more progressive states or more progressive political efforts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I found out this year that, not only had ATT and ATT executives donated to Republican candidates, but ATT helped to fund the establishment of the right wing OAN news network.  I don’t need to fund that.  I happily made the switch to T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some elements I would want as part of an effort to build a progressive buyer’s guide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A system to track a product’s source by state, company.  What % of this car is produced in what state (or finer grained region) by what company?  I’d want to support community involvement, ultimately will want to tap a network of people providing this info.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A system to track a company’s donations and the donations of executives.  Most of this is already public at the FEC website or Opensecrets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A progressive weighting of states, politicians, PACs, etc, and an algorithm to sum those into a total weighting for a product.  It is likely that one would want to support multiple ratings — IE a total progressive rating, a climate change rating, an income inequality rating, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A front end to display a weighting for a product.  And for a given product, show the more progressive alternatives.  You want a certain suv?   This alternative has more content produced in more progressive states, and the execs give less to retrogressive candidates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;random&quot;&gt;Random&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://steampipe.io&quot;&gt;Steampipe.io&lt;/a&gt; – a sql interface on top of all kinds of cloud resources.  Kind of cool.  As Sam says, software engineers love grand unification schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this era of heightened political conflict, why are the US Senators from the state of Washington so nearly invisbile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not like pickles.  But I have great admiration for the pickle lobby who have somehow convinced everyone to put pickles with every sandwich ever.&lt;/p&gt;

Incredibly strange and highly relatable.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recent Books – Deacon King Kong, Don’t Believe It, One Step Too Far, Velocity Weapon, True Believer, Red Sparrow</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/deacon-dont-believe-it-one-step" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recent Books – Deacon King Kong, Don’t Believe It, One Step Too Far, Velocity Weapon, True Believer, Red Sparrow" /><published>2022-04-14T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-04-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/deacon-dont-believe-it-one-step</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/deacon-dont-believe-it-one-step">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51045613-deacon-king-kong&quot;&gt;Deacon King Kong&lt;/a&gt; by James McBride.  Ugh, can’t read.  The central character is so eccentric it is a little cloying.  I moved on.  I am sure based on the good reviews I am missing something, but it was just repellent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36296238-don-t-believe-it&quot;&gt;Don’t Believe It&lt;/a&gt; by Charlie Donlea.  Attempted to cleanse my palate with this, but couldn’t stick with it either.  Just seemed formulaic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58082194-one-step-too-far&quot;&gt;One Step Too Far&lt;/a&gt; by Lisa Gardner.  Another palate cleansing attempt, more successful.  Imagine if Jack Reacher had no physical skills and was a small woman, but still travelled aimlessly around the country trying to right injustices.  Adventure ensues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41085049-velocity-weapon&quot;&gt;Velocity Weapon&lt;/a&gt; by Megan E. O’Keefe.  Eh, just average science fiction.  No really new concepts.  Passes the time but that is all.  Didn’t finish.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12139811-the-true-believer&quot;&gt;The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements&lt;/a&gt; by Eric Hoffer.  An oldie but a goodie.  71 years old, most of the observations are relevant today.  We may be even more susceptible to populist mass movements today.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59337703-red-sparrow&quot;&gt;Red Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; by Jason Matthews.  A little long but a great espionage tale.  Betrayals all over the place.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087-seveneves&quot;&gt;Seveneves&lt;/a&gt; by Neal Stephenson.  A ton of interesting ideas.  A long book.  Maybe spend more of this length really digging into some characters and society and the impact of the ideas on both?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27036577-the-war-on-cops&quot;&gt;The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe&lt;/a&gt; by Heather MacDonald.  The premise of this book is that our police are under attack by largely black activists which makes us all less safe as it leads to more crime.   The book explores both police activity and the limits activists seek, as well as incarceration and the limits activists seek.  The book fails completely for multiple reasons:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It is not a serious attempt to inform or influence.  No citations, no raw data.  False strawmen, ad hominem arguments.  Inflamatory language.  The book is designed to trigger emotional responses, not rational discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The causes of crime are way upstream from policing or incarceration and the author doesn’t dig into any of that.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The author conflates race and culture and economics and muddies the waters.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693476-dark-horse&quot;&gt;Dark Horse&lt;/a&gt; by Gregg Andrew Hurwitz.  OK Reacher-esque tale, tho I would probably just read a Reacher.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54968118-the-code-breaker&quot;&gt;The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race&lt;/a&gt; by Walter Isaacson.  Kind of interesting to read the background on the people involved in the developemnt of CRISPR but I would have liked more technical explanation of how CRISPR actually works.&lt;/li&gt;

I did not realize how much this was a story of a marketing dynasty. A triumph of marketing and business development over morality and good sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247043-this-is-how-they-tell-me-the-world-ends&quot;&gt;This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race&lt;/a&gt; by Nicole Perlroth.  The entire internet is compromised and we better get cracking to fix it.  Our software and internet industries were created by optimists and enthusiasts, but increasingly are inhabited by bad actors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thread across both these books – it is a great strength of our free market economy that we allow new companies to easily create new offerings and enter the market – but we don’t have great mechanisms for assigning responsibility for the societal problems they may create.  The innovators get rich and move on, society is left with the huge costs of opioid addictions or the huge costs of easily hackable software systems.  The innovators should bear more responsibility, but this is a hard problem to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After these two books, I needed some lighter fare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32109569-we-are-legion-we-are-bob&quot;&gt;We Are Legion (We Are Bob)&lt;/a&gt; by Dennis E. Taylor.  A lighthearted tale of galaxy exploration by an idiosyncratic post-human AI and its clones.  There are many more books in the series and I enjoyed, but probably won’t continue as I have too many other books on the pile:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then a transition back to more serious fare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8247140-factory-girls&quot;&gt;Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China&lt;/a&gt; by Leslie T. Chang.  Deep dive into the lives of migrant workers in modern China.  A real “wild wild west” economic scene, inside of a very traditional hierarchical society.  Interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
