  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209563735-death-in-the-spires&quot;&gt;Death In The Spires&lt;/a&gt; by K.J. Charles.  Solid mystery set in early 1900s – a college friend is killed, his friends all scatter, but find themselves drawn back in 10 years later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20186.Seeing_Like_a_State&quot;&gt;Seeing Like A State&lt;/a&gt; by James C. Scott.  States try some pretty typical and consistent patterns to improve their societies (and to serve the state), and they usually come to ruin.  A little long.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63933641-the-loom-of-time&quot;&gt;The Loom of Time&lt;/a&gt; by Robert D. Kaplan.  Excellent walkthrough of the history of the major countries in the Greater Middle East.  We tend to blend all these together, but there is complexity and richness here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223436601-careless-people&quot;&gt;Careless People&lt;/a&gt; by Sarah Wynn-Williams.  Wow.  You can’t read this book and not be disgusted with Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22451908-the-revolt-of-the-public-and-the-crisis-of-authority&quot;&gt;The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority&lt;/a&gt; by Martin Gurri.  Outstanding assessment of the impact of the democratization of information and how it has eroded the legitimacy of authority.  And how the elites in traditional positions of authority (government, party, academia, corporate) are fighting to hang on to their power.  We still have a ways to go before we get to a new stable state in society.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216730681-king-dollar&quot;&gt;King Dollar&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Blustein.  A useful read on the dollar and its role; I would have enjoyed a little more analytical depth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176444106-abundance&quot;&gt;Abundance&lt;/a&gt; By Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson.  I am clearly an abundance faction supporter.  We need leaders who embrace this view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58416952-the-will-of-the-many&quot;&gt;The Will Of The Many&lt;/a&gt; by James Islington.  Fun kickoff to a fantasy series.  Pretty typical fantasy elements, but mostly well written and fun.&lt;/li&gt;

A thriller about a possible domestic terror threat which goes sideways.  Moments of fun but ultimately a little wearing.&lt;/li&gt;

A good look at the state of lithium and rare earth mining in the US, and the tough balance we face between environmental concerns and the need for these materials.  We probably can’t continue to blindly outsource this issue to the rest of the world.&lt;/li&gt;

Great book about SpaceX history and the development of the Falcon rockets and the rest of the SpaceX lineup.  I wish we had more of the Elon in this book and less of the Twitter/political Elon.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321447-chip-war&quot;&gt;Chip War&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Miller.  This was ok, a lot of history I already knew.  A good summary if you want to catxh up with the industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74834673-morning-after-the-revolution&quot;&gt;Morning After the Revolution&lt;/a&gt; by Nellie Bowles.  Hilarious and sad, Bowles rips apart the worst excesses of the progressive movement.&lt;/li&gt;

What a strange book – who is this book for?  The authors are trying for cute I guess, but come across as condescending.  There is a good list here of hard issues around space travel.  And it is certainly going to take a long time to figure out all these issues.  But these authors write like we shouldn’t even try.  I couldn’t finish it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62970022&quot;&gt;Zero Days&lt;/a&gt; by Ruth Ware.  I needed a thriller, this one was dumb.  I get annoyed when clearly smart characters act repeatedly in dumb ways to advance the plot.  I don’t know why I finished it.&lt;/li&gt;

An interesting new perspective on the war for me.  If you accept the book, Stalin played the rest of the Allies like a fiddle to achieve his goals, and there is some truth to that.  I didn’t realize just how generous the US was with lend-lease shipments to the USSR.  That said, I suspect the US was happy to have the USSR bear the brunt of casualties in the war at the expense of some material goods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173754979-james&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; by Percivil Everett.  A fantastic retelling of Huck Finn.  Makes me want to reread the original.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182733784-nuclear-war&quot;&gt;Nuclear War: A Scenario&lt;/a&gt; by Annie Jacobsen.  Oof.  In case you are feeling a little too light and happy this week, pick this up.  Super depressing and even if unlikely, all too likely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2054761.The_Snowball&quot;&gt;The Snowball&lt;/a&gt; by Alice Schroeder.  A biography of Warren Buffet, incredibly boring.  Couldn’t be bothered to finish it.  If you want interesting stuff about Warren Buffet, just read his shareholder letters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75665850-clear-thinking&quot;&gt;Clear Thinking&lt;/a&gt; by Shane Parrish.  Would have been a great long magazine article.  Not really book length material, but a useful framework for thinking more clearly and avoiding common cognitive biases.&lt;/li&gt;

This book gets great reviews, and the premise is compelling, but I gave up 30% of the way in.  I just didn’t care about any of the characters beyond the protagonist, and that wasn’t enough for me.&lt;/li&gt;

I know some people don’t like the fact that the author participated all those years in supporting some bad actors, and only now tries to make amends, but it is a great look inside.  Very hard to trust any media!&lt;/li&gt;

An interesting journey into identify and the many ways we see ourselves and others see us. There were some intriguing parts but needed an editor.&lt;/li&gt;

I kind of had to ignore the author name as I read this book.  It is better written and argued than I expected.  However, there are 3 fundamental issues with the book. First, the author complete conflates human venality and corruption with being “woke”.  Humanity has abused power forever, humans are venal and petty and self-interested and will grasp at tools to expand and abuse their power.  That has been going on forever, there is nothing new about it.  Of course in the current world, some will grab the levers of “woke” and use that to their advantage, but it would be some other lever if not that.  So I too get enraged about abuse and corruption, but I don’t lay it on the doorstep of “woke”.  Secondly, the author confuses “woke” and “a\(hole&quot;. There are plenty of a\)holes in the world, and some of them will be for and against some elements of social justice.  It is not an indictment of social justice concepts that there are a\(holes involved with part of it, nor is it a refutation of social justice if anti-&quot;woke&quot; a\)hole faces some consequences.  Finally,  he is very critical of corporations having political views, and critical of money in politcs, but never touches the Citizens United ruling and its implications.  I too might wish that corporations had no politcal voice and that money did not equal speech but that is not the system we have created.  You can’t demand that one behaviour stop while ignoring the root cause.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117833.The_Master_and_Margarita&quot;&gt;The Master and Margarita&lt;/a&gt; by Mikhail Bulgakov.  Very well regarded, but I may not be Russian enough, and I do not like farce.   Hard to get into.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195790867-moonbound&quot;&gt;Moonbound&lt;/a&gt; by Robin Sloan.  There are a few books that let you peek into a vast strange world and have a fun adventure, and hint at much much more.  The Hobbit was one of those books for me.  This is another.  A fascinating world, a classic hero’s tale, just a lot of fun.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37922709-on-desperate-ground&quot;&gt;On Desperate Ground&lt;/a&gt; by Hampton Sides.  The story of the Chosin Reservoir campaign in the Korean War.  A brutal story, a brutal war.  War sucks, and hubris and incompetence make it suck more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40265841-finding-dorothy&quot;&gt;Finding Dorothy&lt;/a&gt; by Elizabeth Letts.  I am on the fence here.   I did finish the book, but I never really felt like I found Dorothy.  There is a story in here somewhere about how Dorothy is a representation of the women in Baum’s life, but it never quite clicked for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55475687-advanced-portfolio-management&quot;&gt;Advanced Portfolio Management: A Quant’s Guide for Fundamental Investors&lt;/a&gt; by Giuseppe Paleologo.  Solid and short explanation of the mathematical basics of portfolio management.  The math is not intimidating at all, a good read.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60372350-steel-fear&quot;&gt;Steel Fear&lt;/a&gt; by Brandon Webb and John David Mann.  Super fun thriller, reminds me a little of the Alistair MacLean books I loved as a kid, only more modern and better depth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389431-seven-blades-in-black&quot;&gt;Seven Blades in Black&lt;/a&gt; by Sam Sykes.  So I enjoyed this as escapist fare, but it is annoying that every chapter seems to feature an even more fearsome enemy, and the hero discovers a power every chapter that just happens to top that enemy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58353189-a-half-built-garden&quot;&gt;A Half-Built Garden&lt;/a&gt; by Ruthanna Emrys.  An interesting exploration of a eco friendly future, but WAAAAY too long.  Too much description, not enough story.&lt;/li&gt;

For instance this article – https://themissingdatadepot.substack.com/p/higher-educations-illiberal-liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the effort the author went through, it is a useful article.  I don’t really know what is going on on campuses, so I can’t really speak to some of the concerns of the article.  But to me, the article has a large blindspot, which I can best illustrate by talking about my own political progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a staunch conservative household, in a conservative part of Ohio.  Voting for Republicans was just assumed.  As a kid I lived through Kent State, Watergate, Vietnam protests, all of which planted some seeds of skepticism about Republicans and the government more generally.  I watched coverage of Kent State on the news and remember asking my parents why the government was shooting at students.  The CSNY song “Ohio” still haunts me.  I watched Nixon step down.  I watched coverage of running tear gas battles on the OSU campus.  None of that gave me trust in our government, but I still leaned Republican.  The traditional Republican conservative ideals of small government, fiscal responsibility, business friendly, strong defense – those all seemed good to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I aged, my skepticism of authority and government grew.  And the Republican party changed.  It is certainly not the party of fiscal responsibility any more.  But more importantly, the Republicans increasingly embraced intrusive and intolerant social policies.  They sided with the anti-same-sex marriage forces.  They sided with the abortion prohibition groups.  Both these policies are the government intruding into personal business, and into some of the most important personal business of people’s lives.  I don’t care what marriages other people have.  I am fine with some churches saying that they don’t want to perform same-sex marriages, but if other churches want to perform those marriages, A-OK by me, and the government should respect all marriages.  On abortion – no one wants to see more abortions, but it is not anyone’s business besides the parents and their doctors.  Now the Republicans are embracing anti-Trans positions.  I don’t care what adults decide to do about gender identity and their body, it doesn’t affect me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some other beefs about Republican policies but these above are what broke me.  I cannot even consider a Republican candidate until they walk away from these intolerant positions.  I am certainly not a Democrat, the Democrats have some of the stupidest policy ideas ever, but I cannot support the Republican party today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back to the article about illiberal liberalism.  There may well be some really intolerant liberals – and I am not surprised I guess, given the intolerant social positions embraced by the mainstream conservatives.  I can understand the anger towards conservatives.  I personally wouldn’t bother trying to silence these conservatives, I’d let them broadcast their desired social policies and let the electorate vote with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been reading a bit about the notion of “illiberal liberalism” that people talk about.

What a train wreck of hubris.  Ego-driven rush into conflict without any consideration of the consequences.&lt;/li&gt;

What a tragic national and personal story.  Lincoln was unique and the country was fortunate to have him, during a time of incredible tragedy and personal tragedy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62052321-titanium-noir&quot;&gt;Titanium Noir&lt;/a&gt; by Nick Harkaway. A pretty classic noir tale, rendered by a good author.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62979034-translation-state&quot;&gt;Translation State&lt;/a&gt; by Ann Leckie.  Fun exploration of a very messy political situation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17307317-money&quot;&gt;Money: The Unauthorized Biography&lt;/a&gt; by Felix Martin.  An OK walk thru the history of money.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60568507-for-profit&quot;&gt;For Profit: A History of Corporations&lt;/a&gt; by William Magnuson.  I thought this was going to be a much more detailed book.  The long anecdotes about some major corporate structure innovations throughout history were interesting, but ultimately I felt a little unsatisfied.  The last chapter admonitions were just pablum – “corporations shouldn’t do the bad things that some did in the past”.   I was hoping for more meat – a look at some bleeding edge corp structures, a deeper look at the law and regulation, etc.  It is an OK book but left me wanting more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33358751-priestdaddy&quot;&gt;PriestDaddy: A Memoir&lt;/a&gt; by Patricia Lockwood.  Enjoyable at first but kidn of went nowhere and started to feel repetitive.  The window into life with a priest father was interesting for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74846917-spies&quot;&gt;Spies: The Epic Intelligence War Between East and West&lt;/a&gt; by Calder Walton.  A walk through the history of British, US, Soviet, Russian, and Chinese spying.  The main theme is the asymmetry between the approaches of the democratic west and the autocratic nations, and the dangers for the west.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127305853-the-women&quot;&gt;The Women&lt;/a&gt; by Kristin Hannah.  An odd meld of a romance novel and a gritty tale of vietnam service and its after effects.  I loved the vietnam part.&lt;/li&gt;

The story of the opium trade and its impact primarily on India and China, but also Britain and the US.  A lot of great detail on just how pervasive and impactful the trade was.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18634818-red-plenty&quot;&gt;Red Plenty&lt;/a&gt; by Francis Spufford.  A fictionalized account of the Soviet Union’s attempts to create a planned economy that would outperform the west, he book is a mix of real history and fictionalized accounts of the people involved.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127463547-first-lie-wins&quot;&gt;First Lie Wins&lt;/a&gt; by Ashley Elston.  Super fun thriller jaunt, where everyone is morally gray.  Supposedly coming to Hulu.&lt;/li&gt;

There are some interesting concepts and ideas in here.  But gosh a terrible and boring book.  Really this should not be a book but should be an app that injests your DNA sequence and medical tests, and gives you a plan on how to live longer and healthier.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61783804-dust&quot;&gt;Dust: The Modern World in a Trillion Particles&lt;/a&gt; by Jay Owens.  Interesting, infuriating, disagreeable, insightful.  I learned a lot about some ecological disasters – the Aral Sea, the Dust Bowl, etc.  I was intrigued by some of the recovery projects underway.  I was annoyed by some of the degrowth talk, an unrealistic approach.  I was confused about the tie to climate change, as the author points out that dust loads were much higher at times in prehistory, and that climate change may be largely a function of sun cycles and orbital oscillations.  Overall, intriguing.&lt;/li&gt;

A sometimes-too-long exploration of how the middle class has declined, how the rich have gotten richer, how our political systems have failed us.  A lot of data and anecdotes.  The author is ultimately optimistic but gosh it is a rough and sad tale.&lt;/li&gt;

More detail about surfing than I ever wanted (I don’t surf), but all shared in a way that was compelling.  And man, the author’s life choices, a set of choices that I could never have imagined making, chasing after his surfing compulsion.&lt;/li&gt;
