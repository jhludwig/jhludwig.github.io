  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59838811-upgrade&quot;&gt;Upgrade&lt;/a&gt; by Blake Crouch.  Fun bio hackign adventure, not really much new in here tho.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61237044-infinity-gate&quot;&gt;Infinity Gate&lt;/a&gt; by M. R. Carey.  Fun multiple universe romp, a lot of interesting ideas.  I do wish the author had written a smaller story, not every book needs to be part of a universe-ending trilogy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61783804-dust&quot;&gt;Dust: The Modern World in a Trillion Particles&lt;/a&gt; by Jay Owens.  Interesting, infuriating, disagreeable, insightful.  I learned a lot about some ecological disasters – the Aral Sea, the Dust Bowl, etc.  I was intrigued by some of the recovery projects underway.  I was annoyed by some of the degrowth talk, an unrealistic approach.  I was confused about the tie to climate change, as the author points out that dust loads were much higher at times in prehistory, and that climate change may be largely a function of sun cycles and orbital oscillations.  Overall, intriguing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37649549-tailspin&quot;&gt;Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America’s Fifty-Year Fall–and Those Fighting to Reverse It&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Brill.  A sometimes-too-long exploration of how the middle class has declined, how the rich have gotten richer, how our political systems have failed us.  A lot of data and anecdotes.  The author is ultimately optimistic but gosh it is a rough and sad tale.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25515725-barbarian-days&quot;&gt;Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life&lt;/a&gt; by William Finnegan.  What a great book. More detail about surfing than I ever wanted (I don’t surf), but all shared in a way that was compelling.  And man, the author’s life choices, a set of choices that I could never have imagined making, chasing after his surfing compulsion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358103-money&quot;&gt;Money: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing&lt;/a&gt; by Jacob Goldstein.  A breezy and brief history of money.  Not the deepest story but does a nice job of intuitively explaining how money is a social construct.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65211701-system-collapse&quot;&gt;System Collapse&lt;/a&gt; by Martha Wells.  I loved the prior murderbot books, but this one didn’t cut the mustard.  Strays away from the unique murderbot characteristics and is a generic space adventure.&lt;/li&gt;

A little longer discussion about some of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101021832-how-elites-ate-the-social-justice-movement&quot;&gt;How Elites Ate the Social Justice Movement&lt;/a&gt; by Fredrik DeBoer.  I thought I would hate this book.  But half of it is very good and very insightful, he does a great job skewering the left – all the performative nonsense, all the identity divisions, a failure to focus on real improvements for people.  And some of his basic instincts on how progressives can better work together are dead on – unite, don’t divide; focus on actually improving outcomes; drop all the bs language nonsense; and above all else, engage and perservere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what he says drives me nuts though – for instance: “…as progressives, we should want a vibrant and expansive public sector.” I’m progressive, I want better outcomes and opportunities for everyone, I want a stronger safety net.  But I certainly don’t have as a goal “a vibrant and expansive public sector”, that is not the end goal, it is as misdirected at best – show me a successful example in human history of “a vibrant and expansive public sector.”  We need to embrace market mechanisms to improve our society, not discard them.  We need to unlock and embrace human ingenuity, not prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50364458-the-tyranny-of-merit&quot;&gt;The Tyranny of Merit: Can We Find the Common Good?&lt;/a&gt; by Michael J. Sandel.  This book is more right than wrong.  The discussion of the politics of hubris vs embarrassment is very relevant.  And the data on upward mobility in the US is sad.  His criticism of the Ivys and the Public Ivys is good, they are not agents of upward mobility, nor have they ever been.  So there is a lot to learn here.  The book is not without shortcomings tho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The political and social mobility problems here are very hard to fix – and he offers no realistic solutions.  There is zero chance that we will implement a national lottery for access to the best schools.  A more useful discussion would be around how we build up non-elite institutions that may be doing a better job creating opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He is an Ivy professor and he is very focused on the Ivys.  I don’t think reforming the Ivys is all that material to the problems at large.   They’ve always been elitist, they always will be, just move on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I would love to see data on just engineering education and social mobility.  My impression is that most of my classmates did not come from upper income families and that engineering was a great path, but I’d like to see the data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In my professional experience material, wealth has flowed to those that are most adaptable, that have observed the waves crashing through the world and have decided to “get in front of the parade”.  I’ve lived thru the PC revolution, the internet revolution, the mobile revolution, the cloud revolution, and now we are seeing the AI revolution, the CRISPR revolution, etc.  These waves crash over us, none of us can stop them, the people that do well are the ones that don’t fight the waves, but get out in front of them and ride them.  Some of my colleagues came from elite institutions, but many did not.  He doesn’t really take on entrepreneurship, the tech industry, innovative waves, creative destruction, etc.  This is all super material to economic mobility and opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58485511-the-lords-of-easy-money&quot;&gt;The Lords of Easy Money: How the Federal Reserve Broke the American Economy&lt;/a&gt; by Christopher Leonard.  This book is an attempt at a couple of serious topics – how monetary policy has further exacerbated the inequality in our society, how our legislative dysfunction has pushed more power towards the Fed – but the book is so flawed.  The economics in the book are secondary to his attempt to dramatize events.  Each chapter tries to turn some events into a dramatic crisis, but the characters and events just aren’t that interesting, and he sensationalizes it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also overlooks so many factors and simplifies the economics so much that it is hard to give his arguments any credence.  Go read the 2-star reviews on Goodreads, they do a pretty good job of summarizing the problems with the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another peeve, any discussion of the issues needs to start talking about relative percentage growth instead of absolute numbers, even inflation-corrected absolute numbers.   Throwing around a bunch of absolute numbers means nothing and is just designed to scare, not to inform.   When he does use percentages, he finds the most egregious examples to use to scare, not inform.  “76,000 percent more excess bank reserves” – a quote designed to scare, not inform.  I mean, there are like 13984098% more smart phones sold this year than in 2001, should that terrify us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall he is trying to damn the Fed, but I actually think he does the opposite and shows how the Fed is resiliant and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some lighter reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126128174-do-interesting&quot;&gt;Do Interesting: Notice. Collect. Share.&lt;/a&gt; by Russell Davies.  Really nice short book emphasizing the importance of doing, working at your craft and knowledge every single day.&lt;/li&gt;

Continuing my streak of books with ampersands in their titles, another nice tale of friendship and adventure.  Either of these books is a lot of fun.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36040518-the-cutting-edge&quot;&gt;The Cutting Edge&lt;/a&gt; by Jeffery Deaver.  I dip into Deaver every once in a while, a very engaging mystery.&lt;/li&gt;

Some themes that I draw out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human ambition is a great driver of human advancement, and it will take you right off a cliff into the abyss.  Musk has had incredible impact, but perhaps his ambitions have outstripped his competencies.  Seafarers in the 1700s had huge impact on the development of the modern world (good and bad), but at huge personal cost. Turchin is trying to create an industry around his invented filed of “cliodynamics” and is overreaching.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resiliency.  Tweedy tells a great story of not letting ambition get in the way of creative work, how daily effort can create kind of resiliency for you.  Koonin doesn’t really dig into it enough, but raises the idea that we need to be resilient to a warming world, and that we should be investing in technology to help us adapt to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74878650-end-times&quot;&gt;End Times: Elites, Counter-Elites, and the Path of Political Disintegration&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Turchin.  What a stupid book.  This will damage your brain reading it.  A view of the economy as some zero-sum hierarchy with some small number of valuable jobs available at the top of corporations and politics.  Ignores completely enterpreneurism, small businesses, etc. It reads like the author is trying to drum up attention and business for his invented field of “cliodynamics”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57433539-unsettled&quot;&gt;Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters&lt;/a&gt; by Steven E. Koonin.  I expected to hate this book but I did not.  I found it incomplete.  The author raises some good questions about the state of reporting on climate science, and tees up a discussion about how to adapt to a warming world or how to use technology to proactively cool the climate, but doesn’t follow up those discussions at all.  And without digging into those, it is difficult to weigh them against the costs of reducing carbon emissions.  A useful read tho.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122765395-elon-musk&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; by Walter Isaacson.  There is a lot to admire about Elon’s outputs.  He has certainly pushed progress in industries, and the massive reduction in cost of space launches is a notably a tremendously good thing.  Society wants and needs entrepreneurial energy like his.  He may be one of the most effective engineered product leader of our times.  He is also pretty terrible at human relationships, and his engineering entrepreneurial skills don’t translate well to social policy, to media, to politics.  The book is a retelling of events in and around Elon, and doesn’t really dig into issues.  An OK read.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63946909-the-rigor-of-angels&quot;&gt;The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant, and the Ultimate Nature of Reality&lt;/a&gt; by William Egginton.  A deep dive into philosophy and a little bit of physics.  I would have enjoyed more physics content but the philosphy side is a hole in my learning so probably good for me.  Not a light read.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54974657-how-to-write-one-song&quot;&gt;How to Write One Song&lt;/a&gt; by Jeff Tweedy.  Brilliant book.  Simple, pithy, direct.   It is about songwriting, but it is also about life.  His advice for how to work at your craft is something everyone should read.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61714633-the-wager&quot;&gt;The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny, and Murder&lt;/a&gt; by David Grann.  Man, sea travel was tough in the 1700s.  The loss of life due to weather, nutrition, misadventure was incredibly high.  Brutal times.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-scaling-people-by-claire-hughes&quot;&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Psmith have a great review of a recent management book&lt;/a&gt; which you should read – the review, not the book.  They systematically destroy the idea of professional management as a discipline, and management education as well.  And they suggest that the entire notion of professional management as a distinct discipline is just another way to gatekeep.  I loved this entire article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It meshes very well with my own experience in business school and in business.  There were some technical topics I learned in b-school that were of value — how to read accounting statements, basic financial theory, some macro and micro economics — but a lot of the softer topics were just filler.  I didn’t really learn how to lead and manage until I did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also lucky to work at Microsoft at a time when nearly the entire senior leadership team were PC enthusiasts.  They used PCs, they loved PCs, they loved software, everyone was a programmer in some way whether doing system development in ASM/C/C++ or doing application programming in higher level languages or macros.  Handwaving MBA bullshit was not tolerated.   To this day, Microsoft still seems to have a pretty strong enthusiast management team, which has served the company well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nvidia&quot;&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to my first NVIDIA developer conference almost 10 years ago.  I was amazed by the passion of the audience and the quality of the audience.  The sessions were all massively oversubscribed.  I came away a big believer in the opportunity for the company and immediately bought a bunch of NVIDIA stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which was a fortunate move as the company has been on a multyear tear and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/&quot;&gt;doesn’t seem to be slowing down&lt;/a&gt;.  I continue to be impressed with the company’s execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do wonder about the depth of the management team.  I’ve spoken with people who describe the company as a 1-man show, who think there is no depth.  I doubt the company would be executing this well with just a single leader, NVIDIA must have a whole stable of great people.  But who are they, why are they kept under wraps?  And how dependent is the company on one guy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;home&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We purchased a home to use for vacations in the San Juan Islands about 20 years ago.  Since then we have rebuilt the house, drilled a new well, changed the septic system, repaired everything 9 times, etc.  Our adult children use the house a lot and we can see the day some day when we may want to pass over management to the house to them.  I’d like to get all my documents in order so it is easy for someone else to get up to speed on the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://Homer.co&quot;&gt;Homer.co&lt;/a&gt; which seemed like a nice solution.  And I started dutifully populating it with my documents.  About an hour in I came to a crashing halt.  I have 20 years of emails with attachments, I have generations of design documents, I have digitized receipts, I have contacts, etc etc etc.  It would take me years to get this all sorted and organized, and along the way I would fight with myself about the right way to tag and folder everything.  Barf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New plan — I’m going to try to use LlamaIndex and just have it ingest all the docs.  LLamaIndex has great readers for mail content, for pdfs, for word documents, for images.  After some fits and starts, I ended up downloading my 1.2G gmail folder, filtering out some crud, and then reading it all into LLamaIndex using a little python app.  It is limping and is able to answer questions like “Who has worked on our septic system” and “where is the generator and how do i use it”.  There is a lot of fine tuning to do.  But promising.&lt;/p&gt;

Couldn’t finish, just annoying and broken from the start.  Opens with a bunch of breathless collapse handwaving, and then tries to shift to data-based reasoning but is very linear and in-the-box in its analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59485252-fantastic-four&quot;&gt;Fantastic Four: Full Circle&lt;/a&gt; by Alex Ross.  I regularly dip into graphic novels, this one is pretty trite.  Pass.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind&quot;&gt;The Name of the Wind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1215032.The_Wise_Man_s_Fear&quot;&gt;The Wise Man’s Fear&lt;/a&gt; by Patrick Rothfuss.  Engaging, tho there is a little bit of “one damn thing after another” in these books.  And then of course it is frustrating that the next book in the trilogy is apparently never coming out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61358585-bottoms-up-and-the-devil-laughs&quot;&gt;Bottoms Up and the Devil Laughs&lt;/a&gt; by Kerry Howley.  Whew, a peak inside the mechanisms we put in place for the War on Terror is pretty ugly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38525405-the-league&quot;&gt;The League&lt;/a&gt; by John Eisenberg.  A good history of the first 20-30 years of the NFL, and the leaders who scrapped to make it happen.  As a kid I read great stories of Sammy Baugh, Y. A. Tittle, Otto Graham, and other early NFL stars, this book was a great complement to those stories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs&quot;&gt;Bullshit Jobs&lt;/a&gt; by David Graeber.  What a load of crap.  Couldn’t finish.  Are there jobs that are meaningless?  Sure I don’t doubt that.  But he consigns entire catagories of jobs to the dustbin – management, finance, law, etc.  And I don’t buy it, there are meaningful jobs in all those areas, and people can do these jobs with good intent and with meaning.  I may not want to be a corporate lawyer, but there is a ton of meaningful work to do there – risk, IP, partnering, structure, etc etc etc.  Ditto for finance.  I don’t think the author has any experience or understanding of building large signifcant products, and the complexity involved.  His casual disregard for entire occupations and industries was very offputting, I declined to finish.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32603498-the-divide&quot;&gt;The Divide&lt;/a&gt; by Jason Hickel.  Another anthropologist from the London School of Economics, and another underwhelming effort.  The LSE must be a depressing place.  Global poverty is a real issue, and it is clear that there are systemic causes that we have not wrapped our heads around, but the first two thirds of the book is just hectoring, and then the solutions all seem like untenable degrowth proposals.  None of this is going to inspire any change.&lt;/li&gt;

A strong argument that low interest rates are destabilizing and deeply inequitable.  Kind of an anti-MMT book.  He really hammers home the point through analysis of several hundred years of financial history.  I’ve personally been a huge beneficiary of the slowly declining interest rates over most of the course of my working life, another way in which I was incredibly lucky.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34617904-destiny-disrupted&quot;&gt;Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes&lt;/a&gt; by Tamim Ansary.  A history of the world from the perspective of the Islamic world.  I hace often wished I could read history textbooks from other cultures, as we are all programmed with a worldview that is unique to our culture.  This is a great book, I learned a great deal about Islamic culture and how they may see the world.  The Islamic focus on community vs the Christian focus on the individual was a great learning for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61166695-going-zero&quot;&gt;Going Zero&lt;/a&gt; by Anthony McCarten.  Fun thriller about invasive surveillence and a race to avoid and expose it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60825653-the-soulmate&quot;&gt;The Soulmate&lt;/a&gt; by Sally Hepworth.  A young couple witnesses a suicide, and then their life unravels as secrets come out.  Fun and fast read, but won’t stick with me.&lt;/li&gt;

French.  It is sad that this material is not taught to us all.  I come away from this feeling that the US has not really accepted responsibility for this stain on our history, and that we need to do more to remedy the impacts in both the US and outside the US.&lt;/li&gt;

A critical look at the beauty products industry and culture from the front line of beauty products, Korea.

Initially I reacted poorly to this book, the author is a fan of extensive planning ala “waterfall” software projects, and I have seen too much of that.  But he is a little more nuanced, he embraces the iterative model of software development, his notion of “planning” embraces a lot of the early iteration and trial in software development, he would even include early product releases as planning.  He also discusses the idea that an exhaustive plan can be an impediment to getting great projects done – if we all realized the true costs and time requirements of some projects, we would never start them, they would never get done.  Overall a mostly balanced discussion and he has a lot of data to back his views.&lt;/li&gt;
