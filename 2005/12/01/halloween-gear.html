<p>* <a href="http://store.qkits.com/moreinfo.cfm/MX056">Simple Dimmer</a>. Lots of other kits and components here too. * <a href="http://www.parallaxefx.com/">Simple prop controllers</a> and some nice application notes like <a href="http://www.parallaxefx.com/dl/AppNotes/AppNoteFX00002.zip">this skull idea</a> (zipped pdf) * I’m sure I’ve blogged this before, <a href="http://www.hauntmasterproducts.com/9.html">the hauntmaster controller</a> – “The Flex ECT is an externally triggered, dual timer that is connected between a sensor (switch) and the electrically operated event device as shown in the diagram to the right” * Plans to <a href="http://www.hauntedillinois.com/fogtimer.php">build your own event control timer.</a> * A range of <a href="http://www.luxeonstar.com/">LED fixtures and drivers</a>. Seems like all halloween lighting should move to LED over time? * Some hints in here on <a href="http://www.deathlord.net/Lynching/lynch8.htm">silencing pneumatic solenoids</a> – the exhaust noise doesn’t really bother me but maybe I will want to do this some day. * Some <a href="http://www.biasedopinion.com/lighting.aspx">very basic intro guides to haunt lighting</a> * <a href="http://www.animatedlighting.com/products/buildyourownshow.asp">Lighting control units</a>. These look like overkill to me, better for Christmas applications.</p>
