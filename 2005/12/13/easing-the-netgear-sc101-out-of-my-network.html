<p>OK I am easing <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2005/12/netgear_sc101_problems.html">this box</a> out of my network. It has been a disaster. The drives disappear of their own accord. The drivers are not certified (not that I am anal about certification, but this is sloppy and indicates perhaps deeper sloppiness). The software causes strange side effects like an inability to uninstall software using the “add/remove programs” cpl. Files have the read-only flag set despite my constant resetting of the flag. iTunes barfs because of the read-only problem. And on and on.</p>

<p>Oh and Netgear support is unresponsive. And I even tracked down the email addresses for the technical managers at Zetera, the software provider to netgear, and those guys were unresponsive.</p>

<p>So I give up. I’ve uninstalled the client software on all machines but one. That machine is the only machine connecting to the Sc101, and then that machine is resharing the drives out to other machines. Looking now for a good NAS.
