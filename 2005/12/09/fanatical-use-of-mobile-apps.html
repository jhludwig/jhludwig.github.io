<p>Apparently my use of my blackberry to get sports scores must border on the fanatic as my usage made the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB113392267580515883-lMyQjAxMDE1MzAzOTkwMjkyWj.html">WSJ</a>, as also noted in the <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/archives/100765.asp">Seattle PI</a> (with some empathy as John Cook is also a buckeye fan).</p>

<p>I need to stand up for myself a little bit tho. My “check scores 40 times during a game” estimate was just a quick estimate by me, and is probably way off. In actuality if it is a game I care about, I check the play by play results every minute, so a realistic estimate is more like 100-200 times a game. I know, pathetic.</p>

<p>I bet I am not alone tho. I wonder why no one has done an ass-kicking mobile app to track baseball, football, basketball play by play.</p>
