<p>Very happy with the the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">ipod video</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">ipod nano</a>. the nano is just so nice looking.</p>

<p>Reasonably happy with the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/">Xbox360</a>. Nice hardware, everything works well. And looks glorious on highdef. But the games are not very exciting yet.</p>

<p>Happy with the <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/products/cat1150057/cat5420035/prod29780004">Plantronics 640 bluetooth headset</a>. Comes with a nice accessory kit. Good sound quality.</p>

<p>Incomplete on the <a href="http://www.widowpc.com/">widowpc</a> gaming pc. The unit that I received had a malfunctioning liquid cooling system – air in the tubes, vapor lock in the pump. Had to ship back. still waiting….</p>
