<p>I’ve yet to move my house over to a full voip install but still collecting lots of interesting links:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/archives/2005/01/pulver_launches.html">Pulver launches Bellster</a> – now driving termination costs for calls to 0. Do I really want people calling out on my analog lines tho? * <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/pantech-curitel/pantech-curitel-shows-off-first-zigbeecapable-phone-027044.php">Prototype phone with zigbee integration</a> – one attempt at dragging the physical systems of the home into the digital age. * <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2004/12/sam_skype_answe.html">Skype answering machine</a>. I doubt that most people will want to run their answering machine on their pc. The voip answering machine service must emulate the features/availibility of existing answering machines or telco-based answering services – in both cases, easy access from a handset or multiple handsets in the house. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/2004/12/17/voip_at_home.html">Rich reminds me</a> that I don’t just want SIP phones in the house, i need PBX functionality so that extensions work like they should – ie all ring at once on an incoming call. * <a href="http://www.tippyturtle.com">Todd Duffin</a> is way ahead of me, he has done a lot. He’s had good experiences with the <a href="http://www.voipsupply.com/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=14&amp;products_id=33&amp;desc=Sipura%20SPA-2000%20SPA%202000">Sipura SPA-2000</a>, an <a href="http://www.iptel.org/ser/">SER server</a>, and asterisk for pbx/vm. Lot i have to learn here.</p>
