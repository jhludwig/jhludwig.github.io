<p>Via <a href="http://www.sjl.us/main/2005/01/a_longevity_str.html">Scott Loftesness</a>, William Safire’s advice on his ending his NYTimes columns – <em>“When you’re through changing, you’re through.”</em></p>

<p>And <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/01/21/twin_brothers_viability_and_contibution.html">John Zagula had a great meeting last week with Sidney Rittenberg</a> – <em>“Yes, the twin brothers of viability and contribution. Unless what you are doing is set up and made to be a viable enterprise, it won’t survive. But unless what you are doing makes a real contribution it won’t attract people, won’t stay vibrant and won’t last over the long run”</em>.</p>

<p>Great stuff.</p>
