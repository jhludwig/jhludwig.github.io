<p>* <a href="http://people.uis.edu/rschr1/2005/01/sony-pc-doubles-as-tv-john-g-spooner.html">Sony’s new tv/pc combo</a> – ok is there any reason why every new TV won’t someday have a pc next to it or in it? the cost of a reasonably competent pc core is driving down down down. The new <a href="http://www.apple.com">mac mini</a> seems like a great pc to put next to a tv. * And every TV will be able to deal with <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=711">multiple inflows of video</a>, internet (bittorrent) plus the proprietary cable/satellite feed. A common UI for these sources would be great… * For these reasons alone, a dedicated Tivo box is in trouble, but to compound the problems – <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2005_01_07.html#008823">Directv is going to build it’s own dvr</a> as <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=759">comcast already has</a>. Poor strategy by Tivo and huge egos at the pipe owners have combined to sound the deathknell, which is really too bad, the Tivo experience is so much better than the Comcast/Microsoft DVR…</p>

<p>Microsoft is clearly making the right bet with Windows MCE (and here’s a <a href="http://www.matt-fletcher.co.uk/wiki/index.php?title=MCE_2005_-_Windows_Media_Center_Edition_2005_Resources">great MCE wiki</a>) but not clear to me that WinMCE will be the winning software on the tv computer. It is clear tho that there will be a pc in/next to the tv.</p>
