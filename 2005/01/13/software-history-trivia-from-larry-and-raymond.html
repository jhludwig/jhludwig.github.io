<p>Love the discussions by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/11/350628.aspx">raymond</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/01/11/350800.aspx">larry</a> about computer browsing and enumeration on windows. i worked on the windows for workgroups team back when all this was first created and deployed – i still remember the day that the microsoft IT staff came flying into my office with their hair on fire because internal betas of windows for workgroups were bringing the whole company net to a grinding halt because of all the broadcasts and enumeration. A good problem to have – wfw was being adopted within the company.</p>
