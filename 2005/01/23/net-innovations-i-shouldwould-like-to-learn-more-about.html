<p>From the last month or so:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/12/08.html#a1129">Mozilla calendar</a>. Calendaring is what keeps our business tied to exchange, sure would like to look at some alternatives. Webdav required here, I have always found webdav to be impossible to set up correctly. * <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/01/19/tada_lists_keeping_is_simple.html">Johnza finds the latest from 37signals – tada lists.</a> I’m a dedicated user of my blackberry todo list, I’d need this to sync with blackberry * <a href="http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000123025949/">Tutorial on writing firefox extensions</a>. Looks like a pretty low learning curve, no wonder there are so many. * <a href="http://rasterweb.net/raster/2005/01/18/43-crazy-things/">43 things</a>, the latest craze. I created a short list. I don’t really want to spew my personal content all over the web tho, i want these guys to aggregate my list from my own blog. * <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/18.html#a9229">the no-follow tag</a>. here’s hoping that mt does a rev that just slams all the right html all over my blog, i don’t want to go fix all this myself. * <a href="http://go.theregister.com/feed/2004/12/30/ms_ends_pass/">Microsoft shuts down passport service.</a> Classic example of trying to force a platform down people’s throats, instead of just creating something of great utility. A very predictable end. Platforms become platforms because they are popular, not because anyone says they are a platform. * <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/02/1511236&amp;from=rss">Slashdot on bandwidth enabling 3rd party servicing of pcs in the home and business.</a> I totally believe in this. <a href="http://www.purenetworks.com">Pure networks</a> is on the path to this, it is one of the primary reasons we are betting on this space.</p>
