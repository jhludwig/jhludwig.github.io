<p>Hey rich has been having trouble getting the new microsoft/moto dvr box from comcast – rich here is <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001712.html">my blog entry on that</a>.</p>

<p>Also I ordered a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=792">cablecard</a> from comcast today for my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001775.html">new sharp lcdtv</a> -- also impossible to find on the comcast website – call the same number as above and ask for a cablecard. they’ll try to talk you out of it but eventually they will cave.</p>
