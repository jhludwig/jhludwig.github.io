<p>Software I’ve tried recently:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/12/28/GamesKnoppix.html">GamesKnoppix</a>. Yawn. Buggy and mostly in german. Games aren’t anything to write home about. * <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Acrobat Reader 7.0</a>. Recommended. Loads much faster than prior versions. * <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/12/movable_type_3.shtml">MT 3.14</a>. I don’t really notice much but it was an easy upgrade. * <a href="http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm">Tag&amp;Rename 3.2Beta</a>. Yawn. Complicated and wasn’t very good at figuring out tags for my mystery tracks (mostly classical cds or low volume compilations) * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/internet/2004/12/16/a9_for_firefox.html">A9 toolbar for firefox</a>. Works fine but I just can’t get in the a9 mood. * <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/microsoft_antis.html">MS antispyware beta</a>. Recommended – found a couple problems on my machine that others hadn’t, and has free signature updates. * <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=708">Tweaks to speed up firefox</a>. Despite the caveats, they worked for me. * <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20041209_spell_check_for_firefox.phtml">Spell check for firefox</a>. I’m usually ok on spelling but a nice tool to have. * <a href="http://www.truelaunchbar.com/download.html">True Launch Bar</a>. Nice that it is a transparent upgrade to the quicklaunch bar. But a little overpowering.</p>

<p>Software I’d like to try:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/01/great_smallware.html">Great smallware list</a>. I love these little utilities. * <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2004/12/46_bestever_fre.html">46 best freeware utilities</a>. Another good list. * <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/01/04/Sokkit.html">Sokkit</a> -- solves a need for me, easy install/config of AMP on windows.</p>

<p>Intriguing readings on software:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2004/12/public_ontologi.html">Public ontologies</a>. I don’t think end users will ever put keywords/classifications on all their output – but I do think a shared public ontology that can advise free text searching is pretty useful. When I search for “theatrical lighting control”, i’d love it if the search engines could benefit from the collective wisdom of the net and realize that “dmx” and “dmx-512” might be useful synonyms for my search, for instance. * <a href="http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2004/12/great_probabili.html">Bayesian tutorial and code</a>. Cool. * <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000738.html">p2p in 15 lines of code</a>. Unstoppable. * One man’s advice on <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/12/safe_personal_c.html">how to better secure your system</a>.</p>
