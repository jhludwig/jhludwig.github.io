<p>Had our board meeting today. Man I have to say I like our board. Chris (and Ted) from <a href="http://www.ackerley.com/">Ackerley Partners</a> are great guys with domain experience that is so different than ours, and very complementary. I admire <a href="http://madeleines.typepad.com/madelines/">Jerry Colonna</a> hugely, his openness and honesty on his blog are inspiring. And of courze the management team at Judyâ€™s Book is awesome, Andy and Chris are rock solid. Very inspiring group, very inspiring discussion.</p>
