<p>In the northwest:</p>

<p>* On Vancouver Island, the <a href="http://www.aerie.bc.ca/">Aerie</a> or the <a href="http://www.wickinn.com/">Wickaninnish Inn</a>. Ok probably cold and grey right now too but would be great in the summer. * <a href="http://www.stephanie-inn.com/welcome.asp">The Stephanie Inn</a> has always been a winner for us. And we love Cannon Beach. * Further south is the <a href="http://www.tututun.com/flashmain.html">Tu Tu’ Tun</a>, we’ve heard good things about.</p>

<p>Further afield:</p>

<p>* We love Kona Village but we may want to try the other islands. <a href="http://www.turtlebayhotel.com/homepage.cfm">Turtle Bay Hotel</a> looks like a good place to try on Oahu. * The nice folks at <a href="http://www.exclusiveresorts.com">Exclusive Resorts</a> have recommended <a href="http://www.miravalresort.com/">Miraval</a>, and we’re game to try that…</p>
