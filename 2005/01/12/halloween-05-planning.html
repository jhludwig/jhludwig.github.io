<p>So doing early Halloween ‘05 planning. I’ve talked about <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001765.html">my ideas to substantially update my sound system</a>, and in talking to my local theatrical supply house, <a href="http://www.pnta.com/">PNTA</a>, I’ve been pointed to <a href="http://www.stageresearch.com/">SFX from Stageresearch</a> as potentially the right control package for my audio needs. I’ll be digging into this month.</p>

<p>Other random halloween things that have caught my eye:</p>

<p>* Assuming i go to a centralized sound console like above, i’ll want a wireless remote for it. So i can change up the sounds from anywhere in the yard. Need to understan<a href="http://www.frontierdesign.com/products/tranzmain.html">d these wireless mixer controls</a> better. * <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000623.php">Shapelock moldable plastic</a> seems like to could be great for making a lot of props, gravestone elements, etc. * I used some of <a href="http://homeseer.american-data.net/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=HS&amp;Category_Code=ZWAVE">these zwave controllers</a> this past year. way more robust than x10. A little goofy to program. * Want to try some m<a href="http://www.earthsands.com/holiday/halloween/propsswitchmats.html">at switches</a> this year too.</p>
