<p>* First, read yesterday’s (1/27/05) front page WSJ article on the struggle between comcast and the tv networks/producers to deliver on-demand versions of popular programs. Comcast wants to screw the networks/producers, the content owners want to protect their revenue streams, and so users are left with nothing – or more exactly, users are pushed towards unfettered version of shows that leak out thru bittorrent or other means * The networks are in an untenable position – there is just no way to keep their content contained – even if they have the fanciest drm in the world, at some point the tv signal gets rendered onto an rgb/composite/s-video feed so you can see it – take look at <a href="http://WWW.RGB.COM">rgb.com</a>, you can pick up a box today that can capture 1600x1200, 25 frames per second, off a composite or rbg feed. I.E. there is no way to keep good digital copies from surfacing on the web. * Meanwhile, Tivo is under increasing pressure – and <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/01/early_adopters_.html">it looks like consumers will be satisfied with DVRs from their tv provider</a>, rather than buy a Tivo. Too bad because the Tivo experience is way superior to other DVRs – but the egos at Tivo and at the cable/satellite companies are destroying the Tivo business. * And now Apple is crowding into the picture with the stylish Mac mini – <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/cringely_on_the.html">pointer to Cringely</a>, Steve Makofsky on <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/the_mini_media_.html">why people like the mini (and wondering why they don’t like the PC in he same way)</a>, <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9519">reviews of the Mac Mini</a>. But there is no way to get a cable or satellite digital signal into a Mac Mini today – the video providers are dead set against that happening as it creates another way for digital copies to leak onto the net – so users lose out. Can Steve Jobs pull a rabbit out of his hat and solve this? * And of course Microsoft continues to grind away with the Media Center PC. And I think all these front end boxes need a great back end media store in the home – <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/566/axentra_net-box_home">something like this maybe?</a></p>

<p>Where will we all end up? Rich has some good thoughts about the <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/01/26/future_of_home_theater.html">refactoring of the TV experience</a> – and <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/01/25/future_of_video.html">some criticisms of everyone trying to create EPGs</a>. In the short term, Steve Makofsky points out that <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/are_codecs_the_.html">we are headed for greater complexity and confusion as we have to learn about codecs and other software components.</a></p>

<p>Who is going to be the champion of the user, the friend of the user?</p>
