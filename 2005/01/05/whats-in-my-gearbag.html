<p>Motivated to post this by someone who saw my gear bag and asked where to get one. I carry a bag from <a href="http://www.duluthtrading.com/store/catbrief.asp">Duluth Trading</a> – designed for tools but I use for carrying around all my gear. (I use them for tools too – one for pneumatic, one for electric, one for electronics, etc).</p>

<p>In the bag or on my person I carry: * <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">Blackberry 7210</a> with ATTWS service. I’m not going to move to one of the 7100s, I like the full keyboard * <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/">iPod Photo</a>. The photo functionality is lame but at least I have a backup of all my photos now. * <a href="http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/er6.asp">Etymotics Er6</a> earphones. Love these. Theyv’e been very durable. * <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001447.html">JVC subnotebook</a>. The best subnotebook I could find when I looked months ago. There may be better choices now. I like a subnotebook because I can easily carry it anywhere. And I am not trying to replace a desktop. * This <a href="http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=ULT31434&amp;cat=NBB">great connector kit</a> that <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">rich</a> got me. * Blackberry and iPod wallwarts tho I think I can consolidate here * <a href="http://www.casio.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=products.section&amp;catalog=Cameras&amp;section=EXILIM%20Series">Casio Exilim</a> camera. An older model but may upgrade in the next year or so. * Usually 3-4 books. Right now i have “Democracy in America”:amazon, “The Fermata”:amazon, and “A Coffin for Demetrios”:amazon * Business papers * A couple empty notebooks and pens</p>
