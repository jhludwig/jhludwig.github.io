<p>I’m setting up a new machine soon, and mostly for myself, I’m documenting the full software set I need on the machine (or will need access to:)</p>

<p>* OS: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx">Win xp pro</a>. I use the remote desktop feature a lot within the house and between house and work, so XP Pro is necessary. I’m also evaluating <a href="http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html">KnoppMyth</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx">Windows MCE 2005</a> as I may use one of them on a media center machine soon… * <a href="http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_index.php">AVG antivirus</a>. The price is right. * <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> of couse, tho I keep IE around to run WinUpdate and Outlook Web Access. ..and I have a lot of firefox extensions loaded, but the must-haves are Adblock, Tabbrowser Preferences, Download Manager Tweak, Googlebar, Searchkeys, and EditCSS. * <a href="http://www.aim.com">Aim</a>. I don’t have a love affair with AIM but other family members are committed to it, so I am too. * <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe reader 7.0</a>. The latest version is worth the download as it loads a lot faster. * <a href="http://toolbar.yahoo.com">Yahoo toolbar</a>. Ok I don’t actually care about the toolbar but the free spyware detector which is included makes the download worth it. * <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a> for bittorrent downloads. There are probably codec sets I need to download as well but I have forgotten them all, I will have to rediscover. <a href="http://www.kcsoftwares.com/index.php?vtb">Videoinspector</a> is helpful in discovering what codecs i need. * <a href="http://www.apple.com">Itunes</a> of course, as I am an iPod user. For ripping I use <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a> and the codecs implied. * <a href="http://www.pkzip.com/">PKzip</a> or any other reasonable file compression/decompression utility. * <a href="http://desktop.google.com">Google Desktop</a>. Actually I am not sure that I have to have this or not, it is still in the evaluation stage. The idea is nice – but in practice I never seem to use it. * <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857931033.aspx">Outlook</a> for accessing work email. Don’t love it but it is a fact of life. Back when I was wearing the CIO hat for Ignition I tried to move us to some other server alternative but calendar management and people’s familiarity drove us back to exchange and outlook. * <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">Newsgator</a> for feed reading. * <a href="http://www.cloudmark.com">Cloudmark</a> for spam control (ignition is an investor in cloudmark). * one of <a href="http://www.dzsoft.com/">DZsoft</a>’s tools for structured editting. Pretty lightweight which is all I need. I also use <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>. Oh and <a href="http://www.byedesign.freeserve.co.uk/">Spread32</a> is a nice little spreadsheet – I honestly don’t need most of the function of office.</p>

<p>While I don’t need these installed on every machine, I would feel remiss if I didn’t mention <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movabletype</a>, <a href="http://www.activestate.com">Activestate Perl</a>, <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com">Blogrolling</a>, and <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com">Sitemeter</a>. I use these tools every single day, in many ways they are more irreplaceable than most of the desktop software I use.</p>
