<p>Hit <a href="http://www.attrition.ws/76/">Tiger Mountain</a> this morning for a hike. It is a nice area and incredibly convenient – maybe too convenient as it was quite crowded particularly at lower elevations, and the trails are pretty beat. But a gorgeous morning so I can’t complain.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="http://www.theludwigs,com/video/outdoors/GoodMorning.TigerMountain.061905.wmv">my good morning video</a> (3Meg), about 500 feet up from the trail head. And a little later on, on the backside of Tiger Mountain, <a href="http://www.theludwigs,com/video/outdoors/WalkingForDoughnuts.TigerMountain.061905.wmv">walking and thinking about doughnuts</a> (7Meg), the logical conclusion of any hike.</p>
