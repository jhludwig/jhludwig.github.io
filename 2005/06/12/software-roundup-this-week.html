<p>* <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/">Microsoft’s Acrylic</a>. Installed. I’m not a graphics wonk but certainly seems easier to use than GIMP. * <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.html">Sysinternals process explorer</a>. Another great tool for finding out what is going on in your PC. I wish it explained rundll hosted DLLs a little more clearly. * <a href="http://www.dumeter.com/">Dumeter</a>. Nice for seeing what traffic is really hitting the net from your system. Wish this tied back to something like the process explorer so I could see by process. Hey Pure Networks folks… * Phil is <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/06/play-infocom-classics-on-your.html">hosting an infocom interpreter for blackberries on his site</a>. Fun memories. * <a href="http://www.biopassword.com/bp2/products/b%2Didentified/overview.asp">Biopassword</a>. Thought about trying but passed. But I like the idea. * Gadgetopia recommends <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/05/30/BitLord.html">BitLord</a> for torrent downloading, I haven’t tried. * A <a href="http://rasterweb.net/raster/2005/06/09/fireant/">pointer to FireANT</a>. I may start videoing some of my hikes and may want to play around with this. * Something here about <a href="http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000233045841/">Ajax debugging</a>, seems interesting. * Matt Croydon thinks <a href="http://www.a9.com">A9.com</a> <a href="http://www.postneo.com/2005/06/10/a9-search-beta-rocks">rocks</a>. I haven’t looked at for a while, I did today, it does seem to be getting cooler. * Several bloggers pointed towards <a href="http://www.weblogg-ed.com/2005/06/09#a3648">the real-time update log of Wikipedia</a>, so much so that the service went down. Too bad, this would be fascinating to watch. I’m embarrassed to admit that I haven’t contributed anything to Wikipedia yet.</p>
