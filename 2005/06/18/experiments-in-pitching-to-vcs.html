<p>I find these fascinating:</p>

<p>* Fred is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=1173">openly soliciting podcast submissions</a>, he’ll listen to whatever shows up. * Rich <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=46690&amp;item=7524303188&amp;ssPageName=STORE:PROMOBOX:GENERIC">is selling an hour of his time (proceeds to charity) on ebay</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll be interested to hear if anything ever comes from these.</p>
