<p>* A friend recommends the following hikes: Lake Serene near Index off Highway 2, and Mount Pilchuck off the Mountain Loop Highway. * He also recommends <a href="http://www.attrition.ws/">Attrition.WS</a> for trail info. * In an entirely different direction, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/13/428535.aspx">Raymond recommends the Seattle International Juggling Festival.</a> I bet this would be a hoot.</p>
