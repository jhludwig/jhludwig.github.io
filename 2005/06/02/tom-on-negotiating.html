<p>Tom Evslin has <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/FractalsOfChange?m=95">a great post on negotiating</a>. “Lesson #3: start winning right away, even on modalities. Demanding and conceding are habits.” I would not want to be across the table from Tom, I always want him on my side. Thankfully, during the course of my career, I’ve always been on the same side of the table when I worked with Tom.</p>
