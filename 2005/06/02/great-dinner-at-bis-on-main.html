<p>We hadn’t been to <a href="http://www.bisonmain.com/">Bis on Main</a> in years, I am not sure why. We had an outstanding dinner there last night – the best salmon we’ve had in a restaurant in a while. The place was packed as well, clearly the busiest place in Bellevue. I’m not sure how this place fell of our list, but it is back on. (<a href="http://members.judysbook.com/posts/content/review.aspx?ci=3954">Crossposted to Judy’s Book</a>)</p>
