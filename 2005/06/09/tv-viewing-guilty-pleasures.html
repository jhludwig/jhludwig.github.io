<p>Ok I watch way too much video â€“ broadcast tv, sports, dvds, tivo, bittorrent downloads. I like to think that a lot of it is inspiring, thought-provoking, inspirational, or at least well-produced.</p>

<p>But I do have some guilty pleasures. <a href="http://www.thewb.com/Shows/GenericShow/0,11116,228773,00.html">Beauty and the geek</a> is great fun. Shallow babes and socially inept geeks, forced to help each other.</p>

<p>Even further in the gutter, <a href="http://www.cheaters.com/">cheaters</a>. Nothing like a surprise public confrontation of an adulterer for fun. And the smarmiest host on TV. Not to be missed.</p>
