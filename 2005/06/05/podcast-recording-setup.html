<p>Two recos on podcast recording setups:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/podcast/2005/05/28/podcast_recording_equipment.html">Rich’s recos</a> – low end podcasting * <a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/2005_05_19.htm#podcastingsetup">Dan Bricklin’s setup</a> – higher end.</p>

<p>I haven’t done a podcast yet, and well, it just needs to get way easier and simpler than this if I am ever going to. I can’t see podcast creation ever becoming mainstream, certainly not at this level of complexity. Maybe if I could just talk to my cell to record a high quality podcast, i’d do it.</p>
