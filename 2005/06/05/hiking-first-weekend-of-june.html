<p>OK we had intended to hit <a href="http://www.washingtonhikes.com/1999/rattlesnake/index2.html">Rattlesnake Ledge</a> this morning but life got in the way. Perhaps next weekend. Instead I got back out to <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/gis/vmc/Recreation.htm#CM">Cougar Mountain</a> for the second time this week. Starting from the RedTown trailhead, i went out on the Wildside trail and then did a counterclockwise loop on the Marshall’s Hill/De Leo Wall circuit. A nice circuit, I strongly recommend the counterclockwise direction, or you face a killer trail up the De Leo Wall.</p>

<p>Also I love my <a href="http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&amp;catalogId=40000008000&amp;productId=5312&amp;parent_category_rn=0&amp;vcat=REI_SEARCH">new REI Summit Trekking Poles</a> – first poles I’ve had and man they can really make a difference in stability and speed. Now I’m starting to think about getting <a href="http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&amp;catalogId=40000008000&amp;productId=47920372&amp;parent_category_rn=0&amp;vcat=REI_SEARCH">anti-shock poles</a> or <a href="http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&amp;catalogId=40000008000&amp;productId=47873584&amp;parent_category_rn=0&amp;vcat=REI_SEARCH">ultralights</a> . Thanks to <a href="http://www.dystrick.com/webputty/images/hanold.jpg">Terry</a> for turning me onto these (Hey Terry you need a blog).</p>
