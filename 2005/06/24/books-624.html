<p>I’ve been intrigued forever by a couple of phrases that have entered the vocabulary and so I finally read:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0192835505/qid=1119675524/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-1551338-7422408?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">She by H. Rider Haggard</a>. I’ve always wondered about the origin of “She-who-must-be-obeyed.” A classic adventure yarn with moments of brilliance. And who can pass on a book with a jacket blurb by Freud: “a strange book…full of hidden meaning.” * “Catch-22 by Joseph Heller”:amazon. I knew the reputation of this book, but I didn’t realize it was such extreme farce. A little offputting at first, but I got sucked in. And the last couple chapters really slam the book home for me, as some of the farcical elements are left behind and you are forced to confront the realities of war. A timely read.</p>

<p>Oh and <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/06/me_and_books.html">some book pointers over on marginal revolution</a>, always looking for more suggestions.</p>
