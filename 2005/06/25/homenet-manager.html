<p>I just installed <a href="http://www.singleclicksystems.com">Homenet Manager</a>, a competitor to <a href="http://www.networkmagic.com">Network Magic</a> (Ignition is an investor in). Man I feel great about Network Magic after this experience. Homenet Manager has lots of UI bugs, doesn’t let me know what is new on my network, and doesn’t seem to correctly share folders when I ask it to.</p>
