<p>My <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000788.html">Chevy Avalanche</a> has a blind spot in which you can hide Mount Rainer, it is just huge. Backing up has always terrified me as I could easily be running over a child, a horse, a small car, and I’d never know it.</p>

<p>The good folks at <a href="http://www.benchmarkmotoring.com/">Benchmark Motoring</a> helped me out – they installed a rearview camera with fisheye lens, just mounted above the trailer hitch. When I shift into reverse, it takes over the nav screen and displays a rear facing video feed.</p>

<p>I didn’t think it would help that much…but I am hooked. I can’t imagine ever getting any car without this again. Not only is it a great safety feature, but your parallel parking becomes brilliant with this. So much better than a rear view mirror. Highly recommended.</p>
