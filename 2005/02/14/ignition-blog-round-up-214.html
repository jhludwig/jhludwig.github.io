<p>I’m way behind and so missed a lot of good stuff. But a few things I noticed on Ignition blogs (or blog posts about Ignition or its portfolio)…</p>

<p>* Rich is tracking the <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/02/14/vonage_running_bus_and_billboard_ads.html">emerging voip wars</a>, and the most recent <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net/consumer/2005/02/14/skype_is_coming_out_on_mobile.html">skype device announcement</a> – wow, isn’t this device the kind of thing that HP should have made back in the “HP Way” days? * The Jobster team has gone live with <a href="http://www.jobster.blogs.com">a company blog</a>. * A post I’ve been hanging onto for a while, Martin points to a blog all about <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2004/12/the_best_2004_l.html">the best of 2004</a> and wonders how to make a business out of. Does seem like a natural starting point for a nice little ecommerce business. * Martin also continues <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/01/hanging_with_th.html">his biodiesel adventure</a>… * One of the folks at Ignition has some Ethiopian family members – here is a <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExplainingTheEthiopicNumberingSystemAndATinyLessonOnAmharic.aspx">cool post on the Ethopic number system</a>, I had no idea. * Some <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000637031287/">criticism of Melodeo’s service</a> – not sure I totally agree with, I think the Melodeo offering is a reasonable tradeoff of convenience and fairness, but I understand the point. * Rich’s pc hardware investigations – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/02/08/iscsi_for_home.html">iscsi at home</a> and <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/01/05/does_sli_matter.html">Does SLI matter (yes!)</a>. Crap, not only do I not have a water-cooled PC, now I also don’t have iSCSI or an SLI config. I am a loser. * Martin likes <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/01/my_new_favorite_1.html">these web radio stations.</a> I’ve never really understood the attraction, I am an ipod and in-car music listener. But I should try. * Nice press for <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/01/freeware_of_the_3.html">network magic</a> (disclosure – I’m on the board). * Fred <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=738">points to Martin’s posts</a> on tag systems. I am not a believer in tag systems. I think humans just want to do free text searches – let the computers figure out how to parse and tag content. But certainly a lot of heat around tags right now.</p>
