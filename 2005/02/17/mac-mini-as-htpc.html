<p>So after a week of playing with my new mac mini as my hometheater pc, i am mostly happy. I’ve configured it to grab downloaded AVIs (via bittorrent) off my windows file server – the mac connected pretty easily to windows, in some ways it is easier than connecting two xp machines. <a href="http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/avidivx.html">Per this guide</a>, i installed vlc to play the downloaded avis – works great. (Wow I had forgotten how easy it is to install apps on the mac).</p>

<p>Still looking for two things to complete the experience:</p>

<p>* a great 10 foot ui for playing avis and dvds. Myth is overkill, i don’t want all the pvr functionality, i just want the 10 foot UI. * a wireless remote. I have the bluetooth kb and mouse but I want a remote. Maybe this <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/airclick/index.php">griffin airclick</a> tho it doesn’t seem to be shipping yet?</p>

<p>So just a few more pieces and it will be perfect. And for once the mac is the price leader – <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BuildingYourOwnWindowsMediaCenterEdition2005HomeTheaterPCSystem.aspx">compare with windows-based systems that people are building</a>. And of course the mac is the style leader – compare with <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/610/stealth_littlepc_lpc-401fs">this ugly brute</a>.</p>
