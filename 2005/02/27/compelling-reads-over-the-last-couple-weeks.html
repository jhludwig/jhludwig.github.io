<p>* <a href="http://www.timaoutloud.org/archives/000387.html">Tim on limits</a> – “The most important is that the less you can put into a solution or system, the less risk there is to it failing to provide a return on the investment of time and resources. Conversely, it provides the potential for a higher margin if it is indeed successful.” * <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/004216.html?wbfrom=rss">Ballmer on being first</a> – “When Ballmer gets talking about how Microsoft must be first with technology innovations ? which, so far in Microsoft’s history, has not often happened…” – amazing how critics continue to miss the obvious areas where Microsoft was first. The refactoring of the PC industry from vertical all-in-one boxes to today’s horizontal build-your-own didn’t just happen by accident, there is a ton of software innovation that occurred to support and motivate that shift. * Mini-Microsoft pulls no punches – <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/02/something-is-rotten-in-town-of-redmond.html">“Is something rotten in Redmond? Yes! It’s the rotting, fleshy mass of way too many misdirected, underutilized, and unneeded Microsofties.”</a> And on a more prescriptive note: <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/02/lets-fire-all-middle-managers.html">“My humble suggestion: flatten the Microsoft product team management chain.”</a> * Which ties nicely to some good stuff Tom Evslin has been writing – <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/FractalsOfChange?m=17">the flattening of organizations</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/FractalsOfChange?m=20">the flattening of information retrieval.</a></p>
