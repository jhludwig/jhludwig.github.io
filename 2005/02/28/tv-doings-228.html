<p>* Very excited about <a href="http://centerstageproject.com/">centerstage</a> as the media center UI for my mac mini. One of the missing components that this machine needs to be the perfect hometheater pc. * Rich <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/home_theater/2005/02/24/notebook_instead.html">wonders why people aren’t using notebooks</a> as hometheater pcs. It’s a fine point. Price, styling are probably partial blockers.</p>
