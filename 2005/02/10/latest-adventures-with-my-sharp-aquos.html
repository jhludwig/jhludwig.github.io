<p>Finally feeling good enough to start tinkering again, and to blog about it.</p>

<p>I’m continuing my odyssey to attach every piece of technology I can to my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001775.html">sharp aquous beast of a tv.</a> My Mac Mini arrived last week and I have it hooked up now to the DVI port. Looks great. The gotchas: Apple saves money by shipping the mini with no cables, so you have to go buy a DVI cable ($70 at least) and a stereo mini-jack cable (Aside – why does Apple even bother putting a speaker in the mac mini???). 2nd gotcha – the sharp defaults to an analog video signal from the pc, and you have to go wade thru the menus to force it to look for a digital signal – seems like this could be auto-detected. The mini makes a great hometheater pc – small, quiet, a fine dvd player. And I have bittorrent running on it to fill up the hard disk with tv content.</p>

<p>For additional fun I plugged a <a href="http://www.kingston.com/products/pccard.asp">kingston pcmcia hard drive</a> into the pcmcia port on aquous. What a bizarre feature. I can play slide shows and videos off the pccard. Oh and I can take snapshots and video captures of the current signal, as long as it is from a crappy analog input – analog coax, analog s-video. the tv won’t capture the signal from a digital input or from the component inputs, probably to make the mpaa et al happy. So basically it is a really funky and limited DVR. Just goes to show again how much trouble Tivo is in – it is trivial to slam DVR software into any box now, and storage is cheap.</p>

<p>I still have to fill up the hdmi and 1394 inputs…</p>
