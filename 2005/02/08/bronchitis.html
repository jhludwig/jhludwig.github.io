<p>Been quiet for a while, had a killer bronchitis/flu thing. Lost a week plus to fighting this thing. Donâ€™t get it. Probably worsened by the fact that, 15 years ago, I inhaled an aspirin tablet and had to endure 4 bronchoscopies, a hospital stay, and numerous other indignities, and now have a permananently scarred area in my upper lungs. Ask me for the full story sometime, it has its hilarious moments.</p>
