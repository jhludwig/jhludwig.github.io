<p>The UM fan base is getting rev’ed up for The Game. <a href="http://kendawg8.blogspot.com/2005/11/its-that-time-of-year-again.html">Westsider Rider</a> has some of the best:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>A friend of mine on the way to the game gets flipped the bird by a little kid, meaning like 8 years old and his dad pats him on the head and says “Good Job”.</em> We start them young in Ohio.</li>
  <li><em>This past year in Vegas during the summer I’m walking into the Mirage as I walk in head to toe in Michigan gear, my good luck gambling gear, an old grandma easily 60+ yells at me “Fuck Michigan!”</em> I don’t know what the fuss is, that is pretty much how we say “good morning” to each other in Ohio.</li>
  <li><em>The one that trips people out is the year Ohio State won the National Championship you can see their crowd in Tempe and read lips as they pan the crowd following the game people are yelling “Fuck Michigan!” Like we have any relevance at that point, that’s how much they care about us.</em> You have to understand, “F M” is a good sentiment for any occasion.</li>
</ul>

<p>UM people seem to have thin skins – here’s hoping they have another year to stew in their juices.</p>
