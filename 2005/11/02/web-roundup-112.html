<p>* Really want to like <a href="http://www.tipmonkies.com/2005/10/11/jotspot-collaborative-wiki-and-notetaking">Jotspot and Jotspot live</a> as wikis have some really appealing features. But I tried to do a simple thing – family christmas lists - and gave up and went back to <a href="www.tadalists.com">tadalists</a>. Just less confusing clutter. From the experience I kind of wonder if, for personal and shared documents, wikis are a tweener. I find myself gravitating toward a very structured task specific service like <a href="www.tadalists.com">tadalists</a>, or a totally unstructured shared document like <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2005/10/webbased_word_processors.html">writely</a>. But I remain entranced by <a href="http://www.beyondvc.com/2005/10/tiddlywiki.html">TiddlyWiki</a> * Anxious to try <a href="http://web2.0central.com/archives/119">Dabble</a> out. I’d love something with 20% of the power of Excel, but completely roamable. * Phil finds <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/11/j2memap-interactive-google-maps-on-your-mobile-phone/">google maps for mobile devices.</a> Great first attempt. * <a href="http://tech.memeorandum.com/">Memeorandum</a> has found its way into my set of homepages. * Don’t know if <a href="http://www.healthline.com/">Healthline</a> is it, but someone is going to do a great consumer health resource service. * Haven’t had time to try <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> but interested in better music recos. downloading now.</p>
