  <li>I tried to register ignitionlive.com but it was taken. i guess we can’t enter the new “live” era.</li>
  <li>I’m not saying MSFT has committed this error, but I like <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/02.html">Joel’s definition of “the Marimba Phenomenon”</a> – <em>what happens when you spend more on PR and marketing than on development. “Result: everybody checks out your code, and it’s not good yet. These people will be permanently convinced that your code is simple and inadequate, even if you improve it drastically later.”</em></li>
  <li>Office Live sounds interesting – and I wonder if it isn’t a great boon for startups. By validating a <a href="http://www.edbott.com/weblog/?p=1112">hosted intranet</a> offering, Microsoft is kick starting the market. If the Microsoft product isn’t a homerun, someone will fill the void.</li>
