<p>* OK I am late on this one, but <a href="http://www.microsoftmonitor.com/archives/011339.html">MicrosoftMax</a> is really really cool. I’ve seen a lot of photosharing apps, this one is as nice as they come. How odd that this isn’t featured as part of <a href="http://ideas.live.com/">Windows Live</a>. * <a href="http://www.tipmonkies.com/2005/10/18/properly-tag-your-music-w-musicbrainz">MusicBrainz tagger</a>. A fine tagger. I still am looking for something tho that will work in batch mode and a) migrate all my itunes ratings back into the root mp3 files and b) grab all the album artwork. Unattended batch mode is critical, I am not going to manually do this for 60Gig of music. * Via <a href="www.larkware.com">larkware</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2005/10/19/Amazoner10.aspx">Amazoner</a> – easy creation of affiliate links. Really need to do this next time I post book reviews. * <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/10/flock-developer-preview-is-now-available/">Phil on flock</a>. As he says it has a lot of rough edges but I admire the experimentation. * People are getting <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/1547/mac_mini_running">front row running on the mac mini</a>. I will wait for a less hacked version. Could use this very soon tho. * <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/10/windows_calenda.html">Windows Vista calendar</a>. Hmm. Hope this ties back to windows/office live somehow. I’d like an easy to use calendar but it has to roam. * <a href="http://www.hitormiss.org/2005/10/30/how-to-map-a-drive-to-your-ftp-server/">Novell’s Netdrive</a> for mapping an FTP server as a drive. Wow, first Novell software I’ve installed in like 10 years. Nice tho.</p>
