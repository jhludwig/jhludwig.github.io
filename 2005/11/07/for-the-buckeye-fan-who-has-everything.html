<p>OK you don’t need another sweatshirt or t-shirt. You have 7 varieties of caps. You have the windbreaker. The flag. The posters, the books. The marching band records. The foam finger. A Brutus costume. The “Muck Fichigan” pin. So what do you need? Some fine ideas from the alumni mag:</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://www.fossil.com/buckeyes">Fossil watch</a>. Ok not that exotic. * The <a href="http://www.buckeyeblazer.com">scarlet or gray blazer</a>. Always in fashion. * The <a href="http://www.thepopcornfactory.com/Ohio05">popcorn tin</a>. (Hey Marion, how did you let this business slip to some company in Virginia? Marion is the popcorn capital of the world!) * The <a href="http://www.littlebandman.com">marching band miniatures</a>. * Not one, but two varieties of Buckeye Coffee – <a href="http://www.varsityblends.com/ohiostate">Ohio State Varsity Blends</a> or <a href="http://www.drinkstorm.com">Drinkstorm</a>. Particularly apropo for Seattle area residents like me. * Coffee cups and other pottery at <a href="http://www.hartstonepottery.com">Hartstone Pottery</a> * A <a href="http://www.tru-fan.com">buckeye carpet</a>. This would look great in the living room. * A <a href="http://www.sportswoodfurniture.com">buckeye park bench</a>. And here is your living room furniture. * And <a href="http://www.gamedaymurals.com">a mural for the wall</a> – won’t they wonder about our civilization 1000 years from now when they dig this up. * <a href="http://www.buckeyecrunch.com">Buckeye Crunch cereal</a> – the breakfast of true champions. * Or a trip to an exotic part of the world with a group of alums – <a href="http://www.ohiostatealumni.org/tours">Alumni Tours</a>. Nothing says buckeye pride like a trip down the Nile.</p>

<p>Enjoy! And I will accept any and all of these for the holidays.</p>
