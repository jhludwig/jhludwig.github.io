<p>* It’s taken me a while to try Dave’s <a href="www.opml.org">OPML</a> editor, but <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/29/opml-an-awesome-experiment/">this enthusiastic article</a> got me off my ass.  I really want to love this as I am an outlining kind of guy.  But a) I use 5-6 PCs regularly and hate having to install this on all of them, why isn’t it just a website?  b) I really wish it would sync with my bberry.  c) the default web rendering of outlines looks pretty plain (at least in the techcrunch example).  * As <a href="http://www.edbott.com/weblog/?p=1056">Ed Bott says</a>, <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a> is a great way to get error-free CD rips. * Newsgator empire keeps growing <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=783">with acquisition of netnewswire</a>.  Man these guys seem to be building an interesting and deep company.  Love newsgator. * <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4384">Gadgetopia found this claim about Windows Vista boot times</a>.  Man I hope this is true and really works.  I gave up on suspend and hibernate long ago because too many devices just didn’t deal well with.  Of course I rarely turn my PCs off now…</p>
