<p>One of our earliest investments, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/03/hp_buys_rlx/">RLX, was purchased by HP</a>.  Congrats guys!  This article is a little critical of the company, no surprise, theregister is generally pretty snarky.  But they give credit where credit is due – <em>“RLX pioneered the blade server market, offering compact systems well before any of the Tier 1 vendors.”</em>  It was great to be involved with these guys.</p>
