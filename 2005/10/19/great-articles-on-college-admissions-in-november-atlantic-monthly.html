<p>One is online – from the President of Reed College – concerning <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200511/shunning-college-rankings">Reed’s withdrawal from the US News ranking system</a>.  Another only in print or paid sub – <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200511/financial-aid-leveraging">The Best Class Money Can Buy</a>.  Great discussions about how the ranking systems corrupt behaviour, and how colleges are using sophisticated yield management thinking to buff up their rankings and their revenues.  Depressing in many ways but anyone who is working through the college decision process should read.</p>
