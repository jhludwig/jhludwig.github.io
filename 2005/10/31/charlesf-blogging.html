One of the people at MSFT I really miss working with. Wish your blog didn’t look like crap in firefox, charles. Other great MSFTees I see leaving via <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/10/two-microsofties-depart-and-bloggity.html">minimsft</a> – hadi partovi and don gagne. Also great guys and also wish i had the chance to work with them again.</p>
