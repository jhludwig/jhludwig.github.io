  <li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/matrix">Web2.0 mashup matrix</a>.  OK i don’t really know what web2.0 is and I sure don’t know that all the tools and services in this matrix make it any clearer – but this is a way cool matrix of tools and services.  Found <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/2005/10/elicit_from_bingobangosoftware.html">elicit</a> via this matrix</li>
  <li><a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/10/pc_magazines_fr.html">PC Mag free software review</a>.  Haven’t read yet but usually some gems in here</li>
  <li>Tried out <a href="http://www.copilot.com">copilot</a> over the weekend.  OK if you absolutely have no other way to remotely debug a machine, I guess this is OK.  And I admire their pricing model, it aligns exactly with users – a daily fee that is not outrageous.  But this thing is so sssssslllllllooooowwwww.  Use the built-in RDP tools in XP if you can, they are much faster.</li>
  <li><a href="http://myprogs.net/">Myprogs.net</a> – tagging applied to software.  Great way to find yet more crap to install on your system.</li>
  <li>Thread on <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/10/greasemonkey_an.shtml">using greasemonkey to mine microformats</a> from web pages.  I watch this with anticipation.  Would be highly useful to be able to suck phone nums, addresses, events, etc from web pages.</li>
  <li>Phil on some new ambitious ajax apps – <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/10/zimbra-and-meebo/">zimbro and meeba</a>.  I don’t think the vast majority of people here at ignition would mind if we moved to an ajax mail client.  Everyone already uses OWA from home/the road – people rarely VPN in to use email anymore.  <a href="http://www.tipmonkies.com/2005/10/05/airset-the-most-feature-filled-calendar-service-around">Airset</a> worth looking at too.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mailnation.net/">Free terabyte mail service</a>.  Wow.</li>
