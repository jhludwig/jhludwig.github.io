<p>Deployed all my audio systems this weekend – the 4 speaker thunder and lightning system near the door way, the greetings/music systems at each driveway entrance, the graveyard annex system, and the talking tree with voice mod box.  Tested all, sound all ok.</p>

<p>Deployed fog tubing as well.  Didn’t test fogger but it is ready to test tonight perhaps.</p>

<p>Next up – lighting and control cabling deployment.  By this weekend should have all the infrastructure deployed.</p>
