<p>I’m not a huge user of USB keys tho a lot of people are – lots of excitement about these <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/09/1823222&amp;from=rss">keys evolving to contain your entire personalized computing environment</a>.</p>

<p>I’d be more compelled to try using a key this way if a key was integrated into something I already have to carry – my blackberry/cellphone, my car key fob, my ipod.</p>
