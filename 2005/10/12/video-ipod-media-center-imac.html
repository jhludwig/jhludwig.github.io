<p>I’m sure I’ll get one of both, but I have to agree – <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">I have to have HD downloads or I won’t bother with the video service</a>.  And I don’t have a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=1514">subway ride to allow me to watch videos</a> (though I admire the use of [removed site] to fill up the ipod).</p>

<p>Can I just download the FrontRow software for my mac mini?  Doesn’t seem like I can.  Bummer.</p>
