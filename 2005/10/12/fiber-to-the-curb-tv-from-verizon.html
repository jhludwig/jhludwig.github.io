<p>Man wish I lived in <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/1495/verizon_fios_tv">Keller TX and could try out Verizon’s Fiber TV service</a>.  Wonder when Qwest will get its act together, if ever.  And Comcast, well, their HD service sucks – lots of signal dropouts, a/v synch problems, etc.</p>
