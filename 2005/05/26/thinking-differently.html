<p>From <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/05/how_to_think_di.html">JK On The Run</a>, hints <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2005/05/18.html#a1150">on how to think differently</a>. I like <em>“Learning Something Outside Your Comfort Zone: If you’re an artist, learn about String Theory. If you’re a scientist, learn about the aesthetics of music. The more novel and uncomfortable and strange it is, the more it will liberate your calcified brain.”</em></p>
