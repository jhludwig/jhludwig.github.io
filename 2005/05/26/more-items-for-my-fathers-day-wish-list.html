This appears to the best rated single serve machine. * Nightvision binoculars. I have no idea what is really the best deal in this space. * Handheld GPS with topo/trail maps. Not sure what the right unit us. <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a> has lots of choices. UPDATE: Jeff Ort of <a href="http://www.sourcelabs.com">sourcelabs</a> has had good experiences with the <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexVista/">Garmin eTrex Vista</a> and would recommend the Garmin line.</p>
