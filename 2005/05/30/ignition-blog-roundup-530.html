<p>Our extended family of bloggers are becoming overactive, it is hard for me to keep up. Highlights:</p>

<p>* Rich is digging into MT - <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/blogs/2005/05/20/mt_categories.html">nice tip on category tags</a>, and he <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/blogs/2005/05/20/tongfamily_templates.html">graciously posts his templates</a> – nice idea, I will do this when I am finished hacking on mine too. * Rich on computers – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/2005/05/24/computer_ergonomics.html">proper ergonomics</a> (I’ve been getting a stiff neck recently, good tips), <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/05/27/sony_t350.html">and the new evdo-equipped sony laptop</a> – wifi hotspots are becoming a mess, with 4-5 available in a location of uncertain quality and safety, evdo and similar solutions could become a hit with the business crowd. * Phil with some <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/home-networking-resources.html">great thinking on search scoping</a>, <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/announcing-berry-411-version-22.html">releasing the latest version of Berry 411</a> (installed), talking about <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/myvoipweb.html">myvoipweb</a> (don’t trust caller id anymore), showing off <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/recommended-jobs-feed.html">his jobs sidebar</a> (very cool). * Kudos <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net//2005/05/22/melodeo_launches_on_rogers.html">to Melodeo for Rogers launch</a> * Martin is <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/more_meat_for_t.html">bullish on NPUs</a>. * John and Rich’s <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/05/24/taiwanese_edition.html">book out in Taiwan and Korea now</a>! Guys I’d love to hear about the economics behind this. * Jason on <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/rss_jobs_aggreg.html">RSS Jobs aggregators</a>, <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/job_blog_explos.html">job blogs</a>, <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/good_to_great_s.html">good to great staffing</a>, <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/05/we_just_launche.html">Jobster 1.1 launch</a>. The jobster team is reminding me that incredible focus on an exact customer segment and exact customer problems will always pay off. * <a href="http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2005/05/consumer_passio.html">Andy fishing for ideas on how to create passion amongst his customers</a>. My 2 cents Andy - learn from the Jobster guys! * Not an ignition extended family blog, but related to our business – Fred has <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=1120">a nice posting on the “pass”</a>:</p>
