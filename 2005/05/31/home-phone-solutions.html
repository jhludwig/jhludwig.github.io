<p>I’ve never gotten around to <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001751.html">redoing my home phone system to be all-IP</a> but still have a deep interest. Here’s a couple more things to consider when the project bubbles to the top:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/">Asteriskathome</a> – a version of the open source pbx for the home. A nice web management UI and hopefully config’ed for the most common home features. * <a href="http://www.fonality.com/">Fonality</a>. I met these guys last week, great guys. Complete PBX features at a price small businesses can afford. * A <a href="http://www.postneo.com/2005/02/07/open-source-pbxes">list of open source pbx software</a> if i want to go further afield. * Or I could just use <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/01/using_skype_on_.html">this</a> to bridge all my analog handsets over to Skype.</p>
