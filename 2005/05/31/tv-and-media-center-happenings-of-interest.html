<p>Lots of posts recently as people realize that we aren’t going to see cable/satellite HD feeds into MCE machines for a long time – <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000620044935/">No CableCARD for Windows Media Center until Longhorn (probably)</a>, Say It Ain’t So Joe… <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=1531">Why HDTV Support in MCE Won’t Change Until Longhorn Arrives</a>. Not at all shocking, the PC is DRM swiss cheese. Certainly suggests that the closed boxes – TIVO, captive settop boxes – have a long life yet in the home. I bet that you don’t see HDTV support on the PC until you can run a separate OS in a separate VM with hardware-enforced DRM – ie, until you can run a closed hardware/software box inside a PC.</p>

<p>Meanwhile tho, the MCE developer economy continues to grow – <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=320">here’s a list of plugins you can install</a>. Regardless of HD capability, these boxes make way cool DVD players. As does the <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2005_05_15_archive.htm#111625442821583132">XBOX 360</a>. Sure seems to me that the DVD player market will break into two – cheap low-end fixed function players, and then at the high end, people will put in an XBOX, Mac Mini, MCE, or PS3 box.</p>

<p>Another interesting idea is the <a href="http://www.tvharmony.com/blog/archives/2005/05/echostar_to_rol.html">PocketDish</a>. This seems compelling to me, if I could take all my Tivo or Dish content on the road, without futzing around with a full laptop pc, I’d be interested.</p>

<p>Some interesting <a href="http://www.mindjack.com/feature/piracy051305.html">thoughts by Mark Pesce</a> on the future of TV – <em>“The idea of an advertising payload attached unobtrusively to the television program has a certain appeal; it can be ignored, but it’s always present. The audience can’t edit it out of the program without destroying the content of the program. Audiences will learn accept them — so long as the advertisements aren’t too busy, distracting, or otherwise obnoxious.”</em> We’ve watched this whole season of Alias via torrent downloads and I would have been happy to get an HD download direct from ABC or my affiliate which had modest advertising content in it.</p>
