<p>This weekend’s best hike was up Squak Mountain. <a href="http://www.ci.issaquah.wa.us/page.asp?navid=526">The City of Issaquah website lists trailheads</a> – we started at Mountainside Drive. Nice steady uphill hike for 2 miles – gets the heart pumping, but not so extreme that it kills you.</p>

<p>It is a state park but for some reason the <a href="http://www.parks.wa.gov/alpha.asp">state park website</a> doesn’t list it, and I found no good maps online. But the trails are well marked and pretty well maintained.</p>
