<p>Based on <a href="http://www.zagula.com/food_and_wine/2005/05/19/seven_stars_pepper.html">john’s reco</a>, we found our way to seven stars pepper. A little hard to find but it was tasty – the Chong Gin chicken john reco’ed was excellent. But at the end of the meal we all agreed – chinese food is just not our favorite asian cuisine, we far prefer the flavors and spices of thai food.</p>

<p>Also we ate at <a href="http://www.serafinaseattle.com/">serafina</a> for lunch one day. Great great italian, we consistently like the Melanzane alla Serafina (eggplant rolls). Parking can be painful at busy times.</p>
