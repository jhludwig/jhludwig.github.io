<p>Phil Bogle of <a href="http://www.jobster.com">Jobster</a> is one great guy. Now he has created <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/new-utility-add-your-editorial-voice.html">Searchme</a> – makes it easy to create a google search spanning multiple sites. I’ve added the ability to search all ignition blogs over in the search sidebar area.</p>

<p>Phil used the tool himself to create a <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/search-for-jobs-in-ignition-portfolio.html">job search across all ignition portfolio companies.</a></p>

<p>Great stuff.</p>
