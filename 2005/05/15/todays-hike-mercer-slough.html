<p>Another hiking area close to home is <a href="http://www.ci.bellevue.wa.us/page.asp?view=2106">the Mercer Slough</a>. Not that much altitude variation but a really beautiful wetlands area – ferns, dense trees and brush, waterways, birds of all sorts. It was pouring by the time I was done this morning – but that just added to the beauty of the place, it is all about water and life.</p>
