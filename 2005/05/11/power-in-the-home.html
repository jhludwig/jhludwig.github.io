<p>Martin has been an enthusiastic blogger about alternative energy <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/going_biodiesel.html">-- his biodiesel commuter car</a>, a <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/iogen_close_to.html">new cellulose ethanol plant</a>, <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/new_biodiesel_p.html">new biodiesel pumps in seattle</a>. I admire his putting his investment and consumer dollars on the line.</p>

<p>It’s made me intrigued about power. I’ve started at <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/recs/recs2001/publicuse2001.html">the DOE site on power use by consumers</a>. I learned that, as of 2001:</p>

<p>* We’re using about 95 Million BTU per household per year. About 4 3/4s short tons of coal for each of our homes if I did the math right. * Most of our use in the home is for heating (our surroundings and our water) and cooling. * The big story from 1993 to 2001 is declining power usage for heating, offset in part by greater cooling usage. I assume our heating systems are getting more efficient though there could be other reasons. * Appliances and lighting are about a quarter of our use.</p>

<p>I am very curious about the next 10 years of use:</p>

<p>* What will hybrid cars do to our consumption in the home? * How will the entry of low power lighting into the home (compact fluorescent, LED) affect usage? * How will the explosion of digital technology in the home affect our level of use – and our demand for uninterruptible power? * How will all this affect our HVAC needs? * What about home power generation? Good article in Wired about <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/1,2167,67465,00.html">home power generation</a>. and look at this <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000507043014/">cool sharp system</a> for managing your home power generation and grid connection</p>

<p>As a bleeding edge user, I am starting to see strains on the power (and HVAC) systems in my home:</p>

<p>* A sea of wallwarts generating DC power and heat in various places in the house. * Significant heat disposal issues in my office and at media centers. I’ve had to do crazy special things to deal with these problems – a special air conditioner for the office, a venting system and fan for the media center. The existing HVAC system, designed for whole house human comfort, is not designed to deal with waste heat from appliances. * Low end battery backups in a couple places in the home to insure continued operation of phones, pcs, etc.</p>

<p>No conclusions here today, just wondering. I’d love to talk to some home builders and understand what they view as state of the art hvac/power systems in the home.</p>
