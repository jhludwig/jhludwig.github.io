<p>In the last couple weeks I’ve been to Lopez, Vashon, and I’m heading to Port Angeles this weekend, with more trips to Lopez in the offing.</p>

<p>There are instructions up at <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/">the WSDOT site</a> about how to get a ferry schedule on your PDA – sign up for avantgo, download avantgo client, configure a custom channel, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>At least for a fairly recent blackberry, this is all unnecessary. Just point your blackberry browser at the <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedules/pda/">pda schedule link</a> and you will be set.</p>

<p>Of course if you are on Shaw Island or someplace remote with no GPRS or whatever access, well, sorry.</p>

<p>And if you are new to the area – well there is nothing better than a ferry ride on a nice day.</p>

<p>Other handy Northwest links of recent note:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://seattle.wifimug.org">Wifi finder</a> (thanks <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/dglasser/Blog/cns!1p-emyT81hoTzPBWYQDUufJg!297.entry">Danny</a>) * Shop for inflatables at <a href="http://www.ballardinflatables.com/default.asp">Ballard Inflatables</a> or <a href="http://www.westcoastfrogs.com/">West Coast Frogs</a>. While in Ballard I hear that <a href="http://www.inballard.com/Webroot/souvenir.shtml">Souvenir</a> is a cool place to stop – this whole inballard site seems cool. * A slightly stale article on <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/03/emp_rip.html">the decline of the EMP</a>. Visit soon before it is gone. Personally I found the place to be boring – I should be able to hear a lot more music at a music museum, not just read about it.</p>
