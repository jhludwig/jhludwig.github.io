<p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/03/07.html#a1191">Jon’s latest</a> is a great read. I’ve often wished that I could search just a subset of the web – I’d like to give google not a single domain to scope a search, but a list of domains. Jon’s article is a great articulation of that idea in depth – the list of interesting domains he focuses on is your blogroll, but the idea could be used with other lists as well. <a href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2005/03/the_vertical_se.html">Like Tom Evslin</a>, I don’t think I believe in vertical search engines. But I am certainly convinced that people/sites can provide an “editorial voice” on top of the existing search engines, by scoping a search to a set of domains.</p>
