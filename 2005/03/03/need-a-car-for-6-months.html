<p>I need a car for about 6 months to use up on Lopez Island. You can do long term rentals at places like <a href="http://www.budget.com/bbtm/">Budget</a> but very expensive.</p>

<p>Assuming an existing lease may be the way to go – <a href="http://www.swapalease.com/">Swapalease</a> and <a href="http://www.leasetrader.com/">Leasetrader</a> both seem to have a lot of inventory.</p>

<p>I wonder if contacting some local leasing agents directly might not be the smartest thing to do – they must have some leases in default that they need someone to pick up.</p>
