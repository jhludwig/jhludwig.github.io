<p>I am a big fan of non-incandescent light bulbs – I am moving the whole house slowly to lower power/lower heat alternatives. I found <a href="http://www.cyberguys.com/templates/searchdetail.asp?T1=250+0176&amp;dept=&amp;search=&amp;child=">these LED bulbs</a> recently and tried a couple.</p>

<p>Not ready for primetime. Light is too directional, too blue, and not bright enough. But great for places like the garage where those problems aren’t an issue.</p>
