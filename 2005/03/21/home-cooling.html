<p>I am certainly on the bleeding edge here – but in the next 5-10 years home cooling is going to get more complicated than it is today.</p>

<p>I’ve got 4 pcs, a network attached printer, various scanners and cameras, a vonage ata box, hubs, speakers, monitors, router, cable modem, and phone system in my office/server room. Naturally a hot room, but it has become unbearable on sunny days – and so I’ve had to add a dedicated air conditioner for this room.</p>

<p>My media center has a similar problem – the cabinet next to my screen contains a receiver/amp, directivo box, comcast box, dvd, vcr, ld player, etc. I’ve had to punch a hole in a wall and install a fan to vent out to the garage.</p>

<p>The heat generated by consumer electronics is just too much. (Attendant with this is the fan noise problem which can be addressed by clever heat sinks and other designs – but you can’t design away the waste heat).</p>

<p>If I was building a new house I’d explicitly design for these issues. Ventilation, extra thermostats, extra cooling capacity – it is a pain to add this stuff later. House HVAC design is going to get way more complicated.</p>

<p>We can do some things to address the problem – <a href="http://www.geekbooks.com/compact_fluorescent_light_bulbs_2005.htm">moving away from incandescent bulbs for instance</a> – I’ve done that in my problem rooms already. But the problem is just going to grow as we add more sophisticated electronics into our life – I am currently reading “The Bottomless Well”:amazon, on which I’ll write a full review later, but it is pretty convincing that we are going to have more waste heat, not less to deal with, in the future.</p>
