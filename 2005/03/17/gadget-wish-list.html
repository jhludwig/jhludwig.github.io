<p>Gadgets I’ve noticed lately…</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://www.keyboardorganizer.com/product.htm">keyboard organizer</a> – i need the XL model * The <a href="http://www.keyscan.com">Keyscan</a> keyboard/scanner combo – I think I would seriously scan more often if the scanner was this close at hand * A <a href="http://www.openlabs.com/products/product_info-neko64.htm">keyboard/pc</a> – the other kind of keyboard * <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php?masterid=7368171&amp;search=yamaha+ysp-1">Yamaha YSP-1</a> – surround sound from a single component. * The latest ipod accessory – <a href="http://www.sonance.com/subs/products.php?category_id=72&amp;option=get_category&amp;thread_one_cat_id=29&amp;thread_one_cat_name=Electronics&amp;thread_two_cat_id=&amp;thread_two_cat_name=">your house.</a> * Siemens’ <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/household/siemens-develops-combadge-home-communicator-036340.php">wearable whole-house remote</a> – great for my Halloween setup * Hey I have every freakin’ ipod you can buy, so the <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/Motorola_Expect_Several_iTunes_Phones/1110472684">ipod phone</a> is a natural. By the way you have to love Apple’s iPod support policy – my iPod Photo was acting flakey, they gave me a new one, no questions asked. * <a href="http://www.mckelvie.org/">Sam</a> loves <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/688/slim_devices_rocks">the new slimp3 player</a> (nice blog sam). * <a href="http://www.netstumbler.com/2004/12/17/turnable_surfaces_prevent_wi_fi_leaks/">Tunable glass windows to block selective radio transmissions</a> – because I know everyone is trying to steal our secrets. * <a href="http://estone-tech.com/">Car stereo with removable HD</a> – way easier to use than an ipod in the car * And <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,108697,00.asp">a wifi access point in my car</a> – hmm, once i have full ip in the car, it sure seems like all these proprietary car nav systems with dated map discs will get crushed by mapquest/googlemaps/etc</p>
