<p>In a boring meeting the other day, I was reflecting on how many ways people can get ahold of me. I did a little inventory.</p>

<p>Voice: You can call me at:</p>

<p>* 425 709 0772. Ignition central number. Accepts Voicemail * 425 460 0841. Ignition direct number. Accepts Voicemail * 425 922 7055. Cell phone. Accepts Voicemail. * 425 641 4973. Home listed. Accepts Voicemail. * 425 xxx xxxx. Home unlisted. Accepts Voicemail. * 425 xxx xxxx. Onstar in Chevy Avalanche. * 425 xxx xxxx. Vonage. Accepts Voicemail.</p>

<p>Fax: You dinosaur you, you can send me a fax at:</p>

<p>* 425 709 0798. Ignition * 425 xxx xxxx. Vonage.</p>

<p>IM: The younger set can reach me at:</p>

<p>* Jhludwig on AIM * Jhludwig AT hotmail.com on MSN (deprecated)</p>

<p>Email: My most used medium.</p>

<p>* ignitionpartners.com: john, jhludwig, johnlu. Actually a few more are also supported that I’ve set up over the years for various purposes. * fanblogs.com: John. For college football stuff * hotmail.com: jhludwig * gmail.com: john.ludwig * exmsft.com: johnlu (need to verify this still works) * attwireless.blackberry.net: jhludwig (direct to blackberry) * a few other domains i have registered which forward mail to me. * i never bothered to set up my comcast isp account, i guess that could work to, but don’t use it, since i never check it.</p>

<p>Text: again for the younger generation</p>

<p>* SMS me at the cell phone above * Or from a blackberry, send to Bberry pin 20053854</p>

<p>Blog:</p>

<p>* Send a trackback to an entry on theludwigs.com * Trackback or comments on fanblogs</p>

<p>Forums:</p>

<p>* Posts on MethodsofMadness halloween forum * Posts on some school forums</p>

<p>Redirects</p>

<p>* Ebay I believe will redirect messages to my account * All the social networking sites – linkedin, judysbook, friendster, orkut, etc – will send posts/messages to me</p>

<p>Physical mail:</p>

<p>* to ignition * to home</p>

<p>And well you can just Google “john ludwig” and probably figure out a way to get ahold of me. especially now that this is posted.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is – I will actually get all these. I monitor all these inputs on a semiregular basis. Some of them constantly, some more intermittently, but I get them all.</p>

<p>Contrast this situation with the beginning of my working life. I had 1 work phone, 1 work fax, 1 home phone at that time. No email, no sms, no cellphone, etc.</p>

<p>Will this explosion continue? How will people stay on top of it all? The big problem is really controlling use and access. Today I conrol access by deciding to whom and how I reveal these addresses. And then as the addresses leak out, I filter them for unwanted contacts. This seems pretty bass-ackwards. I’d like to be able to publish all of them freely, and then decide based on access lists and rules who is allowed to use which of them.</p>
