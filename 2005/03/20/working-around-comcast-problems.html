<p>I’ve given up on comcast <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001813.html">fixing their IP lease time issues</a>, I am still seeing very short lease times a week+ later.</p>

<p>I have found that my old sonicwall firewall was particularly perturbed by these short leases, so i replaced it with a <a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&amp;scid=35&amp;prid=565">Linksys WRV54G</a> that I had purchased a while ago. No amount of coercion could make it work with the xbox tho – i tried port forwarding, turning on and off upnp, assigning the xbox a static ip and putting it into the dmz, etc. Just never clicked.</p>

<p>So I printed out <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/connect/routerlanding.htm">Microsoft’s advice on compatible routers</a> and trundled off to Fry’s this AM. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Microsoft’s list is very stale, not a single router with these model numbers is actually for sale anymore. So i picked up a <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=1&amp;pid=272">dlink DI-704UP</a> -- I know dlink has great market share, and the number was similar to a router that was supposed to be compatible. Works fine.</p>
