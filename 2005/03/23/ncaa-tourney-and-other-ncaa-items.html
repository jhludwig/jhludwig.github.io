<p>* <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_03_01__arch_file.htm#111152493428542982">The Sports Economist is a great blog</a> – here a great post on why the average scoring margins between high seeds and low seeds in March Madness is shrinking… * …and here a great post on <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_03_01__arch_file.htm#111124585303190595">betting on the tournament</a> and the unavoidable problems it leads to, in part because we refuse to compensate the players. * Of course the NCAA has its head in the sand when it comes to player compensation – <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/fanblogs?m=1326">here claiming that we couldn’t possibly pay the players because athletic departments are losing money</a>. OK the <strong>$6.2 Billion</strong> that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/18/news/companies/cbs_sports/">CBS is paying to televise NCAA basketball</a> is going in someone’s pocket – it is, at best, stupid to claim that the schools don’t have the money to pay the players. Maybe Myles Brand could give up some of his <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2005-01-24-myles-progress_x.htm">$738K in salary (2003)</a> to help pay a few players * And another older but great post from the Sports Economist talks about <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_02_01__arch_file.htm#110803672428396331">applying multipart tariffs to ticket prices</a> – I’m suprised these ideas haven’t been pushed further both at the high end of ticket prices and at the low end – maybe if the schools managed their yields better, they could afford to pay the players a little.</p>
