<p>This <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002198103_dotcon1main06.html">Seattle Times series on Infospace</a> is fascinating and brutal. An incredible collection of misbehaviour. I am very glad Rick Thompson comes out looking relatively good as he is a first class guy who was stuck in an ugly situation.</p>
