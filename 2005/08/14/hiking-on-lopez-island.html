<p>Just back from Lopez, great time. Some tips on hiking up there:</p>

<p>Stop by the chamber of commerce office in the village. Get their list of hikes and current directions – it is quite accurate. Many hikes on the island are on DNR land, accessible only by easement over private property – it can be a little tricky. The Chamber of Commerce directions are great.</p>

<p>The best hikes in my view:</p>

<p>* Shark reef. Short. But nice coastline and sealions. Very busy. * Otis Perkins Park. Go at low tide. A long expanse of beach. Probably safe to ignore private property signs. * Chadwick hill. Definitely need those instructions, accessing the trail head is tricky. No one goes here – Trail is rough, rough. But more vertical than most the trails on the island * Iceberg point. Again you need those instructions, tricky to find the trail. Not strenuous but a gorgeous piece of property, sealions, great views, some vertical gain. Lots of sun. This is the best on the island.</p>
