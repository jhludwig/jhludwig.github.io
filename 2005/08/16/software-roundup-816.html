<p>* <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com">Yahoo Widgets</a> (the software formerly known as konfabulator) is nice, what Active Desktop should have been. We were just too early, ahead of the hardware and ahead of the software. And I was too big a fan of Active Desktop, I learned lots of painful lessons from this experience – just because you want something to be great, doesn’t mean it is great; listen to your team, the truth is there. * <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com">Fanblogs</a> pointed me to a great widget – <a href="http://fanwidget.com">team schedules</a>. Nice. Can’t wait for September. * Who needs powerpoint when <a href="http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000470052355/">S5</a> is around. * <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/07/nvu-friendly-open-source-web-authoring.html">Phil recommends NVU</a> for site authoring * Monad continues to impress – <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/08/rotate_images_w.html">bulk image rotating</a> and <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/08/more_monad_imag.html">scaling</a> * Rich summarizes some <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/photography/2005/08/15/digital_photo_tools.html">good photo tools</a> * <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/08/mossberg_review.html">Walt reviewed evernote</a> while i was out. Sounds cool but…i use 5 machines regularly…I want it server-based…basically I want my blog to work this way. * <a href="http://m.technorati.com">Technorati mobile</a> – nice effort. For me tho technorati has not yet become an essential tool, for my searches it doesn’t provide materially better results than existing search engines.</p>
