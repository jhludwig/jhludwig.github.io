<p>Can’t wait for the season to start.</p>

<p>To put a little damper on my enthusiasm tho – <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005403.php">The buckeyes are already #3</a> – in football revenue. <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_05_01__arch_file.htm#111711545198246615">The Sports Economist points out</a> that expenditures don’t seem to correlate strongly with success though. But they don’t negatively correlate with success either.</p>

<p>Either way, about 85 kids are generating $46M in revenue for the school, which is getting used up to support other sports, build nice facilities, and pay some big salaries to adults. I still have a problem with the morality of this, more of the money should flow to the benefit of the players on the team. Some small suggestions – give the players 8 years of free tuition so that they can realistically get an education and play football. Or underwrite the tuition for the children of former players. Fund a modest disability insurance program for the players.</p>

<p>Anyway, kickoff is 17 days away…</p>
