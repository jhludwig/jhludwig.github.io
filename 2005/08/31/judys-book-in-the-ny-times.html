<p>Very remiss in noting some of the good press that Judy’s Book got in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/15/technology/15ecom.html">NY Times</a> – happened when I was travelling. Nice work guys. Number of postings is growing quickly. (Ignition is an investor in the company)</p>

<p>My favorite Judy’s Book game – be the first to post in a city or area. I’ve staked out Salt Lake City. Love the maps feature.</p>
