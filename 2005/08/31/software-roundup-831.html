<p>* <a href="http://www.kiko.com">Kiko</a> – an ajax calendar. looks nice. <a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/solution-20050831.html">Walt reviewed two others today</a> – it’s an explosion of web calendars, it’s 1998 all over again. Not sure I understand why people will migrate to this new generation. I guess people are more trained to use web services now, and in broadband households, it is easy to always have the calendar live. * Via <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/08/no_install.html">furrygoat</a>, <a href="http://No-install.com">No-install.com</a> – apps that you can put on usb keys. * <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/08/monad_and_wmi.html">Monad and WMI</a> – cool. * <a href="http://Greasemonkeyed.com">Greasemonkeyed.com</a> has like a jillion greasemonkey scripts to install. Playing around with book burro at the moment. * I am easily bought – I use <a href="http://www.a9.com">a9.com</a> frequently now. Not because it is great, but because i get another pi/2 percent discount on my amazon purchases. Same reason i got an Amazon Visa card. * Via <a href="http://www.cpumag.com">cpumag</a> I found <a href="http://www.Free-codecs.com">Free-codecs.com</a> and the K-lite mega codec pak – every freakin’ codec you could ever want. <a href="www.videozilla.net">Videozilla</a> looks interesting in this vein as well. * I should try <a href="http://www.tgrmn.com/">viceversa</a> to manage backups in the house. * I’m tempted to renew my MSDN sub so that I can get <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/29/2241243&amp;from=rss">winfs beta</a> – because who needs a stable filesystem? * Via <a href="http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Netcool.html">geekman</a> I found <a href="http://www.myprogs.net">myprogs</a>. Given my appetite for software, a community ranking site for software seems great. * also given all the software i install, why doesn’t windows have something as nice as ppm in perl for downloading addons/packages/etc? ppm is so easy. * <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Movalog?m=83">Movable type style generator</a> seems cool * JK on the run talks about something that i thought was just me – the <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/08/open_letter_to_.html">impossiblity of doing system restores for tablet pcs</a> . I have a tablet pc collecting dust for exactly this reason – after struggling through 2 system restores i gave up.</p>
