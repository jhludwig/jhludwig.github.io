<p>As usual <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">Rich</a> has been a posting machine during the last month. Some of the highlights I’ve noted:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/11/iceland.html">Iceland travel</a>. I hear they have some fantastic river rafting there. I’m ready to go. Just added to my <a href="http://www.43places.com">43places</a> goals. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/14/perfect_ribs_and_grilled_chicken.html">Grilling resource</a> – I can always use grilling tips. * Rich’s <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/14/casio_exlim_exz750.html">small camera recos</a>. I’m about due. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/home_theater/2005/08/22/zoomplayer_rules.html">Tips on HT PC setup</a> – sounds like zoomplayer is essential. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/2005/08/26/ntfs_resizing.html">NTFS resizing tips</a>. I am sure I will need these some day. * Rich is playing <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/games/2005/08/31/fear.html">FEAR</a>. I think I need a new PC. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/08/31/gaming_pc.html">Rich on Gaming PCs</a>. Having bought 3 and bult 2 others, I am inclined to buy from Falcon Northwest for my next. Debugging the assembly of a high end machine with 2 SLI cards, 10K sata drives, raid arrays, fast dvd/cd drives – well it is just a lot easier to let the Falcon guys burn their time.</p>
