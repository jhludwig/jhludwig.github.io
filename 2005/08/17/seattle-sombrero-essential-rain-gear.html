<p>A bit of rain today which made my hike a little damp. My one essential piece of raingear is <a href="http://www.orgear.com/home/category/home/headware/rain_hats">the Seattle Sombrero</a> – I picked up at <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a>. This hat is great for Northwest weather – a wide-enough brim to keep the drizzly rain out here off of almost my entire trunk. Won’t go out without it.</p>
