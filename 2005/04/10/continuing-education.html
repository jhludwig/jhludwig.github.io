<p>A burgeoning interest area of mine is adult or continuing education. I seriously considered in the last couple years enrolling in a phd program but the traditional university structure just doesnâ€™t work well for adults with families, jobs, etc.</p>

<p>I wonder if programs like <a href="http://www.capella.edu/default.aspx">Capella University</a> are viable.</p>
