<p>Yet again this year we purchased a license to <a href="http://www.ridemax.com/">Ridemax</a> prior to our disneyland trip. Recommended. It is not so much the great schedules it prints out that we love â€“ but the general data on ride wait times at various hours of the day is incredibly helpful. Knowing that there is no need to wait in the Peter Pan line midday, you can get on the ride at 11pm with just a short wait, is incredibly valuable.</p>
