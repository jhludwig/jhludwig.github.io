<p>* The rise of developer communities targetting the hometheater experience is interesting, something I’m fascinated by. For example, this <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/844/itunes_on_your">itunes plugin for tivo</a>. Tivo2 and Windows Media Center Edition are fighting neck and neck for plugins and addons; the Mac Mini is the dark horse. There will be some real breakthrough products and companies here. * Meanwhile the cable industry is trying its best to screw up the experience – <a href="http://www.edbott.com/weblog/archives/000629.html">good posts here on their reticence around cablecards</a>. my personal experience with cablecard is terrible, in fact it has quit working at my house. Getting HD content into the Mac Mini and PC is critical for the success of these platforms. * Hilarious post from <a href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2005/04/meeting_mr_foob.html">Evslin on TV usability</a> – <em>“…A true geek, of course, can play a coffee table full of remotes like a xylophone…“</em></p>
