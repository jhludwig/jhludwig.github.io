<p>After my forays this winter to <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001776.html">Duluth</a> and <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001832.html">el paso</a>, I wasn’t expecting much from the next stop in my tour of minor american cities – prescott, arizona.</p>

<p>Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Prescott is a gem. High desert country – great climate. Pleasantly treelined streets. Historical downtown which has largely been maintained. A little college influence. Lots of restaurants and arts for a small city. Biking, hiking trails abound. Great launch point for sidetrips to Sedona or Flagstaff.</p>

<p>I’d not be sad to go back.</p>
