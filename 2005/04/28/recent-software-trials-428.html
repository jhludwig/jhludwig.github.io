<p>* Via <a href="http://blackberryblog.com/2005/04/19/new_rss_reader_for_blackberry.html">blackberryblog</a>, <a href="http://www.litefeeds.com">litefeeds.com</a>. Promised to be a nice RSS reader for the blackberry, and the blackberry client looked OK and installed easily. But lots of bugs on the server side handling my imported OPML so I gave up. * <a href="http://www.olivelink.com">Olivelink</a>. Promised to be a way to easily share video with friends and family but like most of these apps, couldn’t handle firewall/nat traversal without a bunch of tweaking, so i gave up.</p>

<p>Meaning to Try:</p>

<p>* Alternatives to newsgator – <a href="http://www.intravnews.com">intravnews</a> and <a href="http://www.yousoftware.com">You Subscribe</a>. OK I love newsgator and it has been a rock for me, but worth looking around as I haven’ gotten any new features from newsgator in a while. * <a href="http://www.orb.com">orb</a>. Another videosharing app. <a href="http://www.blogmatrix.com">Blogmatrix</a> might be worth trying too. * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=315557">Flexwiki upgrade</a>. I use flexwiki for some personal projects and generally like it. Looks like a worthy upgrade.</p>
