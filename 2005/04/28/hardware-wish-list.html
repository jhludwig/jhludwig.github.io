<p>* <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/854/stompbox_evdo_wireless">Stompbox in-car evdo router</a>. Hey kevin at <a href="http://www.benchmarkmotoring.com">benchmark motoring</a>, this is what I want to do in my car. <a href="http://www.byodkm.net/?m=show&amp;id=110">mobycar</a> is another interesting in-car solution. (An interesting aspect is the crushing effect this is going to have on all the dedicated telematics plays – once we all have a hotspot in our car with evdo/umts routing back out to the net – who needs all the captive, controlled services from onstar, etc?) * PC mods – <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/input/sunbeam-20in1-front-panel-reviewed-verdict-excellent-100431.php">Sunbeam 20-in-1 front panel</a>, <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/games/2005/03/26/passively_cooled_video_cards.html">cooler quieter video cards</a>, * A <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net/consumer/gadgets/2005/03/31/sony_psp.html">PSP</a> and <a href="http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/853/psp_waci_nx">this hack</a> for controlling media gear. Oh and here is a whole roundup of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000720038308/">psp hacks</a> * <a href="http://www.slingmedia.com/index.html">Slingbox</a> – another way to serve up my video anywhere. * And I’d like to set up a <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/03/neighbornode.shtml">neighbornode</a>, this seems totally cool. * And an <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1790349,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532">hdtv that prints</a> – gosh I am always wanting printouts of tv pictures</p>
