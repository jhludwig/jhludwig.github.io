<p>The web is an amazing thing. Saved us from a cooking disaster this weekend.</p>

<p>We hauled our rice cooker out of the small appliance graveyard in our house â€“ wedged in between the juicer and bread machine, just in front of the waffle iron, on top of the paninni grill. Sadly tho, we had no manual for it. The cooker is like 10 years old, I figured we were hosed.</p>

<p>But hats off to Panasonic for <a href="http://service.us.panasonic.com/operman/">putting all their product manuals on the web</a>, even old ones.</p>
