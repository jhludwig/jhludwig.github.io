<p>Per the pros, <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005313.php">the Buckeyes have 7-1 odds of being the national champs</a>, behind only USC.</p>

<p>OK I love the Buckeyes, but their line play was not all that strong last season, <a href="http://www.collegefootballnews.com/Big_Ten/2005_Previews/2005_BigTen_Unitrankings.htm">and per at least one ranking</a>, they are not as strong as several of the other contenders in the Big10 this year. On either side of the line.</p>

<p>I have a hard time believing that the relative lack of line strength will result in the top finish in the Big 10, let alone the BCS.</p>
