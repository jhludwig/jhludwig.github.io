<p>Went up <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/images/Hiking/MTSI-072005.JPG">Mt Si</a> this week – first time ever. 4 miles one way, I think about 3200’ vertical gain. Gorgeous day and gorgeous spot. I think I still like Rattlesnake ledge better but this was beautiful.</p>

<p>Along the way, discovered my hiking boots weren’t all they could be. Upgraded to some <a href="http://www.asolo.com/">asolos</a>.</p>
