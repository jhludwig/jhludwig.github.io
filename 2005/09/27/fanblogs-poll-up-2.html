<p><a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/fanblogs_xiv/005789.php">Week 5 poll up</a>.  For me the top 4 were easy – SC, Texas, Va Tech all look great and are undefeated, and OSU has the best D I’ve seen and an emerging offense.  I have deep questions about the rest of the poll – some teams have gaudy records but haven’t been tested, others have been tested but haven’t looked impressive.   Still a long season ahead of us.</p>
