<p>Per <a href="http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/natlRank.jsp?div=4&amp;rpt=IA_teamrushdef&amp;site=org">the NCAA stats site</a>, OSU is #1 in rushing defense. And against good quality opposition. Definitely having a national championship year on defense, and the offense is perking up. A fun team to watch right now.</p>
