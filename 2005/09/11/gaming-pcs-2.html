<p>So <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/08/31/gaming_pc_off_the_shelf.html">rich looked at some gaming pcs recently</a> – the big brands of alien, voodoo, and falcon nw. I’m in the market soon for a new pc and looked at their sites. On the way, A9 and Google pointed me towards some other contenders: <a href="http://www.hypersonic-pc.com/2001/index.asp">Hypersonic</a> in New York, and <a href="http://www.widowpc.com/">WidowPC</a> in Texas – the Widow guys are particularly aggressive at trying to get gaming pc search traffic.</p>

<p>And PC Mag mentions <a href="http://www.abspc.com/index.asp">ABS</a> and <a href="http://www.velocitymicro.com/index.php">Velocity Micro</a> as options.</p>

<p>The Widow systems seem to have the most extreme config options. I’m tempted to try them.</p>
