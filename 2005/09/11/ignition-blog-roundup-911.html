<p>* <a href="http://www.geekfishing.net//2005/09/07/edge_phone_as_a_modem.html">Adrian is trying out EDGE</a> for wireless connections. Sounds good. I am tired of futzing around with crappy public wifi access points. Couple it with a <a href="http://www.junxionbox.com/">box like this</a> and you can run your own hotspot where you need it. * Brad in a thread on <a href="http://www.beyondvc.com/2005/07/net_and_vc_loya.html">.net and vcs</a> from this summer. Like he says, we’re agnostic. We can’t afford to be technology bigots. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/09/price_inversion.html">Martin points out that biodiesel is now cheaper here than regular diesel</a>. Exciting times for energy investors. * I’m a sucker for <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/optical-illusion/">optical illusions – nice one</a> from phil. * Rich is <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/09/02/a9_maps.html">in love with a9 maps</a> and misquotes me. I think what I was really trying to say is Google is finally figuring out how to be sticky. They are providing a platform now that hundreds of apps are using. As they expand and get thousands of apps to use their underlying service, well that will be quite an asset. * People inside Microsoft <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/09/three-quick-things-jobs-dynamics.html">took note of the aggressive recruiting</a> that our friends at <a href="http://www.judysbook.com">Judy’s Book</a> and <a href="http://www.mpire.com">Mpire</a> co-sponsored. Nice work guys! * Phil keeps cranking on his blackberry app – <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/08/find-your-dream-job-on-your-cellphone.html">find jobs</a> on your phone, and <a href="http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/08/oreillys-blackberry-hacks-coming-this.html">his app will be featured in an upcoming bberry hacks book.</a> Nice.</p>
