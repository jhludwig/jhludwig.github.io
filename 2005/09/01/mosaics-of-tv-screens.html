<p>From the WSJ and other press, discussion of the <a href="http://www.mcall.com/business/local/all-mosaicaug31,0,4278363.story?coll=all-businesslocal-hed">mosaic feature</a> coming to our TV screens – watch 8 football games at once.</p>

<p>I think this is just brilliant. Football fans will pay for this. And further keeps the DSL guys at bay – they can’t even deliver one video stream, let alone 8 simultaneous games.</p>

<p>There is so much discussion about hollywood content, drm, iptv, etc – we seem to forget that live sports may be a much more important driver of video in the home. Certainly in my household our video provider selections are driven by sports programming issues – college game packages, hdtv availability, etc.</p>
