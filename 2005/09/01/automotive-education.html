<p>I’m doing some research on automotive engineering education for high school and undergrad students. Wonder if anyone has any tips. The things I’ve found so far:</p>

<p>* The <a href="http://students.sae.org/">SAE student site</a> is a fine place to look for information. Competitions, awards, internships – more college student focused. This <a href="http://www.sae.org/news/releases/05smfinal.htm">supermileage contes</a>t looks fun. I wonder if there is an opportunity to create some biodiesel version of this project. * The <a href="http://students.sae.org/chapters/choosecollege.htm">SAE website for college selection</a> has some good tips about programs. * <a href="http://www.kettering.edu/">Kettering University</a> -- formerly GMI – a highly regarded school, but Flint is tough duty. OK I haven’t been to Flint in 17 years, maybe it has improved. * Of course <a href="http://www.umich.edu">UM</a> has all kinds of programs – <a href="http://www.umtri.umich.edu/">Transportation Research</a>, <a href="http://arc.engin.umich.edu/">ARC</a> – but you have to cheer for the Wolverines and there are some lines I just can’t cross. OK full disclosure – I spent my freshman year in college at UM, I was a traitor to the state of Ohio, but I finally saw the light. * Down in NASCAR country, <a href="http://www.ces.clemson.edu/me/research/index.htm">Clemson</a> has a program. There must be other NASCAR state schools that have programs? * <a href="http://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/">Colorado State</a> from the SAE site is supposed to have a program of some sort. * The <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu/">art center college of design</a> in Pasadena has a program, more focused on aesthetics.</p>
