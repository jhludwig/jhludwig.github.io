<p>* <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/07/one_mans_respon.html">Responding to the negative energy balance FUD around biodiesel</a> – good stuff * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/seattle_leading.html">Seattle leading way to embrace Kyoto</a> – great news. I think we’re way behind in fully embracing eco-friendly industrial policies in this country. Put it this way – if you want to defend your economy and markets from high growth, emerging producers – raising the eco-bar way high is probably a good thing to do. Emerging producers may be able to produce basic high volume goods cheaply, but it will take them a while to catch up with highly-engineered green goods and services. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/chemical_proces.html">Martin discovers process modelling software</a> – I have no real use for these tools but they are incredibly fun to play with. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/some_fun_with_o.html">Current supply and demand numbers</a> – fuel prices are only going one way. * <a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/from_bits_to_ba.html">From Bits to Barrels</a> – Martin’s contribution to SNS, journaling his transformation into the John D.
