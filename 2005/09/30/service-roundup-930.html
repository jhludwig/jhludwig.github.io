<p>* As mentioned I love <a href="http://www.rollyo.com">rollyo</a>.  Just created a HalloweenPlans searchroll.  How do I link directly to this?  Not clear. * Like Chris <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2005/9/29/1269746.html">I hate BetaPlace</a>.  It makes getting beta bits so hard, I just tend to give up. * <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/09/webbased_deskto.shtml">Roundup of web-based productivity apps</a>.  I need a great XL and PPT replacement. * An incredibly easy-to-use wiki continues to appeal to me.  <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/09/wikimania.html">I’m not the only one</a>.  <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/27/jotspot-live-the-perfect-wiki/">People seem excited</a> about <a href="http://www.jotlive.com/">jotlive</a> * <a href="http://www.tipmonkies.com/2005/09/24/figure-out-what-those-windows-processes-do">Process Library</a> – another guide to all those damn things running on your machine.  I’m partial to <a href="http://www.answersthatwork.com/">answers that work</a> but sometimes you have to triangulate * <a href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/09/netvibes_cool_p.html">Netvibes seems really cool</a> – i thought about creating a little ignition blog portal with it – but it has problems with logins and remembering your content.  worth watching tho. * <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/09/28/swik_-_a_wiki_as_a_marketplace.html">Swik</a> from our friends at sourcelabs. Cool.</p>
