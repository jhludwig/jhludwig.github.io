But I admit I’ve been guilty of this mistake in the past – inventing new protocols when all we needed was some feature work layered on existing solutions. Seems like the marketplace eventually shakes this stuff out for the most part. * <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/09/thoughts.html">Furrygoat on foldershare</a> – i think the folder sync feature is going to be a feature that shows up in a hundred products. I don’t think it will last as a separate business. That said, simple folder syncing is a real need – <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OverwhelmedAndEnamoredWithFolderShare.aspx">lots of people love foldershare.</a> (Another related solution to check out is <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/swnews/swnews.nsf/n/lsan6flnnt?OpenDocument&amp;Site=tivoli">the recently announced ibm continuous backup product</a> – different solution but does achieve one of the goals, backup) (oh and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/09/07/462032.aspx">larry likes his mirra</a>) * <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=584">Ed Bott’s recommended software list.</a> Good stuff. * <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg4/TheDailyGrind705.html">Larkware on Omea Pro</a> – I was initially intrigued but it feels heavyweight to me. I want something simpler than outlook, not something equally complicated. * <a href="http://blackberryblog.com/2005/09/04/repligo_professional_for_blackberry.html">A better attachment viewer for the bberry</a> – bberry attachment viewing is pretty bad, this looks nice. * <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheComingReturnOfAJAX.aspx">Scott provides a bunch of AJAX links</a>, good place to start reading.</p>
