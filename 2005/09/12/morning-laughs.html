<p>* Love the <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/10.html#a11100">Ballmer chair-throwing game</a>. Though I canâ€™t seem to find Kai-Fu on the game at all. I guess I suck at throwing chairs. * And <a href="http://www.jimhblog.com/jimhblog/2005/09/religious_humor.html">the always popular religion jokes</a></p>
