<p>OK this is the most boring weekend of big 10 football in recent history. The <a href="http://bigten.collegesports.com/sports/m-footbl/big10-m-footbl-body.html">Big 10 itself says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>With eight unbeaten teams and a non-conference record of 18-3, the Big Ten is off to its best start in the last decade.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But boy I beg to differ. With the Iowa, Michigan, and OSU losses last week, the blush is off this rose. And look at some of these stunning matchups this weekend:</p>

<p>* Eastern Michigan at Michigan * Northern Iowa at Iowa * San Diego State at Ohio State * Central Michigan at Penn State * Florida Atlantic at Minnesota</p>

<p>And then there is the that classic: Kentucky at Indiana. Do these states even know what a football looks like? and just no buzz at all around Illinois at Cal and Wisconsin at North Carolina.</p>

<p>The only stories at all this weekend are:</p>

<p>* Purdue’s first real game with a visit to Arizona. A terrible letdown for Purdue if they can’t win this. * Michigan State at ND. Can ND continue to show up strong?</p>

<p>Pretty thin gruel.</p>
