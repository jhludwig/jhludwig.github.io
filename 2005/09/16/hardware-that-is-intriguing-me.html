<p>* Would love to deploy <a href="http://www.thegadgethome.com/">digital door locks</a> but they just don’t match any of our hardware. My car has keyless entry now, so I am frustrated that the house does not. * This <a href="http://www.gadgets-weblog.com/50226711/hardfi_transfering_music_easier.php">hard-fi thing</a> seems like vaporware but could be cool. I definitely would buy something that shortcuts the path from CD to ipod. * <a href="http://www.netgear.com/products/details/SC101.php">Netgear’s home nas</a> – i used to have a little snap nas – it didn’t last long and had perf issues. but maybe worth trying again. * Wonder how the <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/06/slingbox_offici.html">slingbox</a> is selling. * Picked up these <a href="http://www.alteclansing.com/product_details.asp?pID=XT1">altec lansing speakers</a> last month and have been happy * not a product but <a href="http://www.hackaday.com/">hackaday</a> is a fun site for hardware projects</p>
