<p>I sure hope that all the bloggers, who have so much time and energy to blast the emergency preparedness and emergency response of our various levels of government, have spent just as much time and energy actually trying to help the victims of this disaster.</p>

<p>Kudos to everyone who has helped. We gave at the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">American Red Cross</a>. <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/">CharityNavigator</a> has some other ideas as well. I understand <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/hurricanekatrina/2002474637_evacuees06m.html">some refugees are coming to the northwest</a> and we’ll look for ways to help them as well.</p>

<p>I don’t know how effective our government response has been and I personally don’t care to dig into that right now. First job is to help people. None of us should expect the government to solve the problem, that is not the way the world works.</p>
