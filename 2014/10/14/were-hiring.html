<p>I buried this in a post the other day, bringing it to the fore. I am fortunate to be working with a <a href="http://www.surround.io/">small team of great technical and business leaders</a>, and we are ready to expand. <a href="info@surround.io">Drop us a note</a> (or mail me directly) if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are excited about Raspberry Pis, the internet of things, embedded systems, and pervasive computing</li>
  <li>have 2-5 years of hands-on experience in software development</li>
  <li>have background with linux systems development, mobile development, or cloud/web development</li>
  <li>as a bonus, have experience with image processing or computer vision</li>
  <li>are interested in being part of small dynamic focused collaborative no-nonsense team</li>
  <li>and are excited about joining an early stage startup with experienced technical and venture management</li>
</ul>
