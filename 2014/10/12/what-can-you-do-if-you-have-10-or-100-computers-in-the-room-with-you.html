<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/12/3-8m-pi/">3.8M Raspberry Pis sold and apparently the pace is accelerating</a>. I’ve got 8 sitting on my desk right now.</p>

<p>For well over a year, we’ve been asking ourselves “What could we do if we had 5 cheap computers on our desk or in the room? 15? 50?”</p>

<p>It is an exciting problem to think about. It certainly feels like the early days of the PC industry all over again.</p>

<p>Anyway, we are now ready to scale up our team, <a href="http://www.surround.io/">we are hiring</a>. <a href="info@surround.io">Drop us a note</a> if you:</p>
