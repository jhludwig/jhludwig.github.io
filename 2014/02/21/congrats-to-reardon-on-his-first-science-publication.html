<p>Quite an achievement – <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6173/857.abstract">Dendritic Inhibition in the Hippocampus Supports Fear Learning</a> – and won’t be his last. I am jealous, I have aspired to go down the research path at many different points in my life but it has never worked out. Huge congrats!</p>
