<p>Over the holidays I had to create an <a href="https://www.uvvu.com/">Ultraviolet account</a>. I was trying to watch a movie on our new XBOX One and I could only find it on the <a href="http://www.vudu.com">Vudu</a> provider, and so first I had to create a Vudu account, and then that chained into having to create an Ultraviolet account. No idea why all this fuss was required, and I didn’t really know what Ultraviolet was for, but we got to watch our movie.</p>

<p>Now one month in, I get a piece of marketing spam from Ultraviolet, and now it is all clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine … the freedom to access your movies and TV shows through many retailers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. Mind blown. What a world that would be. I am so thrilled and excited. It sounds so much better than the 20 other legal or not-so-legal ways to watch videos. And I am so glad that retailers are fully involved, that sounds like it is going to be so much better for me.</p>
