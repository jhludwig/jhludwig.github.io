<p>Just a reminder to self – some of the kits out there come with &lt;1 amp supplies, and most come with 1 amp. The 1 amp supply is barely adequate for the base rpi plus camera. Less than 1 amp and camera use will drop your internet connection.</p>

<p>Now if you add in a USB wifi dongle, 1 amp no longer is sufficient. I am having to use a powered hub.</p>

<p>I’d suggest a 2 amp minimum supply.</p>
