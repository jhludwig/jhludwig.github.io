<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Planet-Blues-Robert-Sawyer-ebook/dp/B009KUWYG4/">Red Planet Blues</a> by Robert Sawyer. Noirish mystery on Mars. Fun and engaging. I hope Mars is this cool when we eventually settle it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Odds-Against-Tomorrow-Nathaniel-Rich-ebook/dp/B00ANI9EMO/">Odds Against Tomorrow</a> by Nathaniel Rich. I don’t enjoy reading farce, and this was drifting that way, but then the author made the characters very human despite being in the midst of a terrible tragedy. Surprised me in a good way.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Darwin-Elevator-Dire-Earth-Cycle-ebook/dp/B00BABT9VY/">The Darwin Elevator</a> by Jason Hough. A set of mysterious alien artifacts show up on Earth and shit breaks loose. A fun ride. The following two volumes – Exodus Towers, Plague Forge – lose a little of the energy, the author wasn’t able to maintain the alien mystery, but still a fun set.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/St-Zita-Society-Novel-ebook/dp/B0061NZUE6/">The St Zita Society</a> by Ruth Rendell. Rendell is a great author, and this book is well regarded, but it just didn’t grab me, I gave up quite quickly. A rush of characters early that I didn’t care about.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dispute-Over-Very-Italian-Piglet-ebook/dp/B00IOE3P2E/">Dispute Over a Very Italian Piglet</a> by Amara Lakhous. This was a very engaging tale about corruption and bigotry in modern day Italy. Great main character, I’m left wanting more.</li>
