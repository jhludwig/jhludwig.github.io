  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Burning-Paradise-Robert-Charles-Wilson-ebook/dp/B00DA6XFS0">Burning Paradise</a> by Robert Charles Wilson. YA pre-apocalyptic alternative history. Fun premise: a somewhat-intelligent organism has pervasively and surreptitiously infected the earth’s biosphere for hidden purposes, but some humans have started to trip to the fact. So fun but characters weak.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Submergence-J-M-Ledgard-ebook/dp/B00BHOSVB8/">Submergence</a> by J. M. Ledgard. Moody tale about a spy and scientist submerged in their respective worlds, submerged in very different ways, trying to come out of their worlds and build a relationship. Not sure how I feel about, I think I’d have to be in just the right mood to like this book.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Go-Back-Reacher-Novel-ebook/dp/B00B0LP48G/">Never Go Back</a> by Lee Child. Another great Reacher book, stronger than some, we see inside Reacher a little more as he grapples with the possibility that he is a father. We need more of this in the Reacher series.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Town-Parties-Funeral-Plus--inAmericas-ebook/dp/B008JHXO6S/">This Town</a> by Mark Leibovich. Inside look at Washington DC. The author knows it is a cesspool, and writes appropriately cynically, but it comes across even worse than he thinks. and he is pretty open about what a self-dealing cesspool it is. So, read this if you feel like stocking up on cynicism.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/S-J-Abrams/dp/0316201642/">S.</a> by J. J. Abrams and Doug Dorst. Well. This book is flawed, the story wavers, it is a pain in the ass to read, there is no way to buy a convenient electronic form because of the physical complexity of the book. And those are all the reasons why I like it as well – ambiguity, confusion, excellent use of physical media, etc. If you wonder how physical books can survive the onslaught of e-books, this is a great book to read and think about.</li>
