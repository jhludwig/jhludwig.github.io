<p>Javascript tools suck, all the sample code on the web is invariably wrong in some way, variable scoping as practiced is horrible, debugging is terrible. And I am just focused on a single browser target! Iâ€™ve spent a day chasing after some pass-by-reference and scoping problem. Grrr.</p>

<p>Of course when I spend a day on Objective-C problems, I am pretty convinced it is the worst tool ever with its bloviated syntax and huge masses of obsolete sample code.</p>

<p>And when I spend a day on python I get so cranky about crappy IDEs and crappy debuggers and crappy library documentation.</p>

<p>The only constant is me, probably I am doing it all wrong, regardless of the environment.</p>
