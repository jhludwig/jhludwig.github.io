  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Angelmaker-Nick-Harkaway-ebook/dp/B005IQZ7IG">Angelmaker</a> by Nick Harkaway. A fun adventurous romp, reminds of the early Tim Powers books, but with a lighter touch.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coldbrook-Hammer-Tim-Lebbon-ebook/dp/B00FUZPQ2W">Coldbrook</a> by Tim Lebbon. Many worlds and zombies, almost a perfect book :). <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/coldbrook.jpeg"><img src="images/coldbrook.jpeg" alt="coldbrook" /></a>A great tale, I am a little surprised he hasnâ€™t penned a followup, tho some of the material might be off-putting to some readers.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Speedboat-NYRB-Classics-Renata-Adler-ebook/dp/B008LNWTXY">Speedboat</a> by Renata Adler. A stream of consciousness ramble. Not usually my style but I was engaged. The book has held up well.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grasshopper-Jungle-Andrew-Smith-ebook/dp/B007HU7LNK">Grasshopper Jungle</a> by Andrew Smith. Zombies and giant bugs, another near perfect pairing. Not quite as engaging as the Lebbon but still quite fun.</li>
