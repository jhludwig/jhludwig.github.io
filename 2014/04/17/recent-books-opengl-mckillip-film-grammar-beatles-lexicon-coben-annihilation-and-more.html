  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/OpenGL-Programming-Guide-Official-Learning/dp/0321773039">OpenGL Programming Guide</a> by Shreiner, Sellers, Kessenich, Licea-Kane. Incredibly boring in a good way. Very useful depth walkthru of OpenGL.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forty-Signs-Rain-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0553585800/">Forty Signs of Rain</a> by Kim Stanley Robinson. Boring in a bad way, unreadable. The author attempts to wrap his nonfiction treatise with some thin and dull characters who lead boring lives. Gave up on.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Riddle-Master-Patricia-McKillip/dp/0441005969">Riddle-Master</a> by Patricia A McKillip. Fun semi-classic fantasy romp. Nicely wraps up in a modest number of pages unlike the modern commercial 10+ tome series.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Film-Language-Daniel-Arijon/dp/187950507X">Grammar of the Film Language</a> by Daniel Arijon. Great reference on a topic I was clueless about, hat tip to Paul. A little dated but super useful.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Head-Beatles-Records-Sixties-ebook/dp/B0050DRVUO/">Revolution in the Head</a> by Ian MacDonald. Another excellent history of the Beatles, focusing on their songs and what was going on in the culture and the group at the time. MacDonald takes a very critical look at the songs at times, which makes the discussion all that much more compelling.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lexicon-Max-Barry-ebook/dp/B00AEBETMK/">Lexicon</a> by Max Barry. Fun adventure with very erudite zombies.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Winter-Laura-Kasischke-ebook/dp/B00DB3D424/">Mind of Winter</a> by Laura Kasischke. Uber-creepy story of a woman in the grips of a possible breakdown, or is something else going on?</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Missing-You-Harlan-Coben-ebook/dp/B00DMCPQUW">Missing You</a> by Harlan Coben. Another solid Coben, started out a little slow, but grabbed by the end.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Annihilation-Novel-Southern-Reach-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00EGJ32A6/">Annihilation</a> by Jeff VanderMeer. At first I thought this was going to be yet another post-apocalyptic dystopian series written to sell books, but this is something quite different. An expedition enters a blighted area in the south, and nothing is what it seems – the nature of the blight, the goals of the expedition, the members of the expedition all have hidden natures. I’ve pre-ordered the next book.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Duke-Deception-Vintage-Geoffrey-Wolff-ebook/dp/B004G60B58/">Duke of Deception</a> by Geoffrey Wolff. A man unravels the life of his father – a conman, liar, thief, but still a loving father. Complex relationship.</li>
