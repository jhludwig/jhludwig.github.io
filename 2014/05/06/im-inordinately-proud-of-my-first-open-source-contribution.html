Ok it was a silly little bit of frippery, adding line thickness to some line drawing routines, about 4 lines of code, but it has been a long long time since I contributed any code to any effort so it makes me kind of happy.</p>

<p>I have a more sizeable contribution chunked up and ready to go soon, so hopefully this wonâ€™t be the last.</p>
