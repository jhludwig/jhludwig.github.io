The fact that all the Pis gave up the ghost at the same exact time, and were all using the same power supply, makes me suspect a power glitch. The RPIs are horribly underpowered (and i mean power in the electrical sense) – for instance it is a known issue that with some power supplies, taking a picture will cause the ethernet connection to drop.</p>

<p>But honestly I’d have been happy if they ran for 5 minutes before exploding. So progress.</p>
