<p>I bought a Lytro back in the day. It spent a week in my bag before it hit the technology graveyard in the corner of my office.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://getnarrative.com/">narrative clip</a> lasted maybe a week. Everyone around me was freaked out. And mostly I just ended up with a lot of pictures of the edge of my desk.</p>

<p>I just got my <a href="http://www.charmedlabs.com/pixystart">Pixy</a>. Maybe I am doing it wrong but this thing doesnâ€™t seem to detect squat. Maybe it works great in some super controlled setting but not worth my time.</p>

<p>Of course I had to order a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1307511016/centr-interactive-panoramic-video-in-the-palm-of-y">Centr</a>.</p>

<p>I am eternally optimistic. One of these things is going to be useful.</p>
