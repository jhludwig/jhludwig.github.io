<p>So I’ve been acquiring and playing with 50-100 year old electrical lab instruments.</p>

<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/freqmeter.jpg"><img src="images/freqmeter-300x225.jpg" alt="freqmeter" /></a>My latest is a <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_2/chpt_12/2.html">reed-type frequency meter</a>, I didn’t even know these things existed. Great admiration for the people who originally designed these things, a very clever little design. We tried a brief experiment to get it running today, but no response. We may not have been applying enough voltage, the wires in these things could probably handle 50+ amps.</p>

<p>I’ve also got this potentiometer<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/potentiometer.jpg"><img src="images/potentiometer-300x215.jpg" alt="potentiometer" /></a>, utterly crazy looking, and with controls and labels that are a mystery to me – terminals labeled E+ and E-, H and H1, L and L1, BA+, R, and a couple others. A big wonking selector switch that looks like it could transmit 50 amps, and a fine tuning gauge. I’ll be putting an ohmmeter on this thing to see what the hell is going on.</p>

<p>I’ve also got some more awesome potentiometers and voltmeters. As well as a variable capacitor. These things were built for the ages – massive wires, plenty of ventilation, solid wood and metal and bakelite construction. They are all amazingly beautiful.</p>

<p>I’m working to bond an arduino to some of these so I can use them for more mundane modern purposes. But they look great just sitting on the shelf.</p>
