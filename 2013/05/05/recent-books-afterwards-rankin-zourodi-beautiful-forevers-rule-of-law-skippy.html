  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Afterwards-A-Novel-Rosamund-Lupton/dp/0307716554/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366824603&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=afterwards">Afterwards</a> by Rosamund Lupton. A family is shattered by a school fire, and the critically injured mother battles to protect her kids and uncover the truth around the events. Great story about the relationship between a woman and her family, tested by extreme events. The voice used in the story is a little confusing at times – I read the Kindle version, I wonder if the printed version used typography to better set apart the actions and thoughts of various characters.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Standing-Another-Grave-Detective-Inspector/dp/0316224588/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366824842&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=standing+in+another+man%27s+grave">Standing in Another Man’s Grave</a> by Ian Rankin. Great detective tale featuring an abrasive self-destructive sleuth. I should read more in the series.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Thessaly-Deadly-Mystery-Mysteries/dp/0316217875/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366824968&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+doctor+of+thessaly">The Doctor of Thessaly</a> by Anne Zouroudi. Another great detective character and story. In both this tale and the Rankin, the leads care about justice and to hell with the rules. But they go about it totally different ways. The Rankin character is a blunt rusty knife, the Zouroudi character is a judo master. Fun stuff.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behind-Beautiful-Forevers-Mumbai-Undercity/dp/1400067553/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367178907&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=behind+the+beautiful+forevers">Behind the Beautiful Forevers</a> by Katherine Boo. Fascinating but challenging read about life in the Mumbai slums. Challenging because the lives depicted are so brutal, the culture so corrupt. I’m left wrung out, and having no idea how to do anything about.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Rule-Law-Tom-Bingham/dp/014103453X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367643203&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rule+of+law">The Rule of Law</a> by Tom Bingham. Well written and pretty crisp, a nice coverage of what the phrase “the rule of law” means, its history, and implications for today. Worthwhile.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Skippy-Dies-Novel-Paul-Murray/dp/0865478619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367643315&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=skippy+dies">Skippy Dies</a> by Paul Murray. Eh. Teenage boys can be creeps, I don’t need a whole novel pointing this out over and over and over again.</li>
