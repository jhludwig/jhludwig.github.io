<p>In all my playing around with arduinos and raspberrypis, I haven’t really gotten into wearables. But for some reason this <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/product/1356">color sensor</a> just seems totally cool. And then I get drawn to the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1246">lux sensor</a> and the <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1059">GPS module</a> and <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1247">accelerometer</a> and well just about all of it. I don’t really have a great idea what to do with it – maybe tie it into OneBusAway and have something light up with the bus is near, time and gps wise?</p>
