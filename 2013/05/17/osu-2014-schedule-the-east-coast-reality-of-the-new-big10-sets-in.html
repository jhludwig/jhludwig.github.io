<p>Look at the first half of this schedule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aug. 30 - vs. Navy (at Baltimore’s M&amp;T Bank Stadium)</li>
  <li>Sept. 13 - Kent State</li>
  <li>Sept. 20 - Virginia Tech</li>
  <li>Sept. 27 - Cincinnati</li>
  <li>Oct. 4 - at Maryland</li>
  <li>Oct. 18 - Rutgers</li>
  <li>Oct. 25 - at Penn State</li>
</ul>

<p>You’d not be able to tell this team was in the Big10 based on this. The center of mass of this schedule is somewhere like Hagerstown, Maryland.</p>
