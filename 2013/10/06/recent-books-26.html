<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/candide.jpg"><img src="images/candide-199x300.jpg" alt="candide" /></a>The last set of books I read had some stinkers, perhaps not suprising given that I was surfing through popular genre fictions. Decided to raise my standards a little bit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harvesting-Biosphere-What-Taken-Nature/dp/026201856X/">Harvesting the Biosphere</a> by Vaclav Smil. Some <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates">random blogger</a> recommended this book, it’s a descriptive survey of human consumption of the planet’s biological resources. Not very prescriptive, but interesting and great background data. Boy could the author use some data visualization advice tho, a few charts would go a LONG way.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Candide-Optimism-Penguin-Classics-ebook/dp/B00B7NP1HQ/">Candide</a> by Voltaire. What a fun book. My knowledge of mid-1700 European politics and intellectual movements is pretty thin, so thankfully the notes give a lot of context. We need a modern version of this talk written with our idiotic current government and politics as the setting.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sunflower-Possibilities-Limits-Forgiveness-ebook/dp/B000SEH8U8/">The Sunflower</a> by Simon Wiesenthal. This was in the house, I think one of kids had to read this at some point. Probably best read as part of a discussion group or class, the book is not that long or engaging, but the discussions could be very enlightening.</li>
</ul>
