<p><a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/chips.jpg"><img src="images/chips-300x225.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikelove/" /></a>Crap there are too many choices. <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2537">XDA dev</a> has somewhat popular options for the ATT G2</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cleanrom is the most popular and scrapes off all the AT&amp;T goo while leaving LG goo. This seems like a reasonable approach</li>
  <li>AEON is second most popular but man the pages feel sketchy.</li>
  <li>Basic rom is the third choice and seems to wipe off AT&amp;T and LG cruft.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there is some Korean derivative and a stock AT&amp;T rom that has been rooted.</p>

<p>This is probably all going to turn into a chocolate mess. Don’t be surprised if you call me or text me and never hear back.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Ok I am working first on rooting the phone. This is so obvious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to Settings, General, About Phone, Software Information, and whale away on “Build Number” until developer mode unlocks. Crappiest easter egg ever.</li>
  <li>Back to Settings…General…Developer Options and turn on USB Debugging.</li>
  <li>On your PC, download the LG drivers from <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/support/software-manuals">the LG support web site</a>.</li>
  <li>Hook up the phone to the pc</li>
  <li><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2448887">download the ioroot package</a> pointed to by the xda forums</li>
</ul>

<p>OK so I guess I am rooted now. Yay. Geek merit badge partially redeemed.</p>
