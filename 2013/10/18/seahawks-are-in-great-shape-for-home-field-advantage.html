<p>In the “counting chickens way before they’ve hatched department”, look at the remaining schedule for the Seahawks, Niners, and Saints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seahawks remaining opponents are 20-32 in aggregate. Niners: 24-34. Saints: 26-31. Advantage: Seahawks.</li>
  <li>Seahawks remaining opponents average a little worse than 3rd place in their divisions. Niners and Saints, about midway between 2nd and 3rd. Advantage: Seahawks.</li>
  <li>Seahawks have 4 remaining away games. Niners 6, Saints 5. Advantage: Seahawks.</li>
  <li>Seahawks away games are easier – the opponents have an average 2-4 record. Niners: 2-4, Saints: 3-3. Advantage or Push: Seahawks</li>
</ul>

<p>The Seahawks are benefitting in particular from the Giants and Vikings cratering this year. Has left them with a great opportunity to secure home field advantage throughout the playoffs, which of course for Seattle is a substantial advantage.</p>

<p>Enjoy your NFL weekend!</p>
