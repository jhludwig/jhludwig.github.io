<blockquote>
  <p>The health care reform law will not be defunded or delayed. No taxes will be cut, and the deal calls for no new cuts to federal spending or limits to social welfare programs. The only things Republicans achieved were billions of dollars in damage to the economy, harm to the nation’s reputation and a rock-bottom public approval rating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So glad I live in the Washington that is sane, that is moving ahead on healthcare, that doesn’t have a significantly crazy congressional delegation.</p>
