The acoustics arenâ€™t awesome but a great place to see a band.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.shovelsandrope.com/">Shovels &amp; Rope</a> blew the f$%king doors off the place. They were loud and had great energy. Love their songwriting and their stage presence and interplay. We first became hooked on them based on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nElVTkXmLo">this video</a> which is an utterly intoxicating performance, and captures their presence. But wow they kick up the volume and energy for most of their live show, it was very much a rock and roll show. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dhKoNXp-9M">Tickin Bomb</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBJGTOycVxU">Shank Hill Street</a> were both excellent with the added energy and volume, the guitar work was awesome. A super talented duo, so glad to have seen them.</p>
