  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ghostman-Roger-Hobbs/dp/0307959961/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086673&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ghostman">Ghostman</a> by Roger Hobbs. Excellent thriller about a world-class thief trying to thread the needle between rival criminal organizations and law enforcement. Great character. I’d read more featuring.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Business-Model-Generation-Visionaries-Challengers/dp/0470876417/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086717&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=business+model+generation">Business Model Generation</a> by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur. I don’t read many popular business books, they are all so repetitive and derivative. This book wasn’t terrible – the authors aren’t trying to sell you on their thesis, but are giving you a compendium of tools for thinking about business models</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Garden-Evening-Mists-Tan-Twan/dp/1602861803/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086748&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+garden+of+evening+mists">The Garden of Evening Mists</a> by Tan Twan Eng. Excellent story about a young ethnic Chinese woman in Malaya during and after WWII. The intertwining of many cultures, the horrific treatment of groups by the rulers of the moment, and how everyone coped and survived. A window into a part of the world and its history of which I have been largely ignorant.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fault-Our-Stars-John-Green/dp/0525478817/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086786&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+fault+in+our+stars">The Fault in Our Stars</a> by John Green. Two teenage cancer sufferers find love amidst their tragedy. Not an easy read but will grab you. Apparently under production as a movie.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extinction-Machine-Joe-Ledger-Novel/dp/0312552211/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086897&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=extinction+machine">Extinction Machine</a> by Jonathan Maberry. Eh. Super tough government agent violently unravels a conspiracy involving aliens. Not very original.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Path-Dagger-Coin/dp/0316080683/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086927&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+dragon%27s+path">The Dragon’s Path</a> by Daniel Abraham. High quality fantasy. Not quite as bold as Game of Thrones but pretty darn good with compelling characters and a bit lighter tone than Game of Thrones.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Double-Game-Dan-Fesperman/dp/0307700135/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366086979&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+double+game">The Double Game</a> by Dan Fespeman. Held my attention but the motivations of main character seemed like nonsense.</li>
</ul>
