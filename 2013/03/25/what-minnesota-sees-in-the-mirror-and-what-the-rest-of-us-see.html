<p>So <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9096499/minnesota-gophers-dismiss-tubby-smith-day-ncaa-tourney-ouster">Minnesota fired Tubby</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/MedcalfByESPN">@MedcalfByESPN</a> is pretty clear that the real problem lies within the Minnesota athletic program and community – failure to build facilities, failure to support program, etc:</p>
