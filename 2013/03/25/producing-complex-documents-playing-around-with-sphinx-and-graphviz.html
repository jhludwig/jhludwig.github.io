<p>I have a need to collaborate on some complex documents and I am trying out <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> as the document build system. Plays nice with github, promises to play well with code (tho I haven’t really tried that out yet), uses <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> for markup. I would have preferred that it used markdown (well, <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">multimarkdown</a>, I kind of need tables), but rST seems fine. Sphinx builds HTML, text, PDF, and a bunch of other output formats.</p>

<p>I also need some simple flowchart imagery and <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/Gallery.php">GraphViz</a> seems like the way to go – auto generation of flowcharts, etc from simple text descriptions. Again plays nice with github, with my favorite text editor, etc.</p>

<p>For text editing I have moved to <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>. I love bbedit but I do have the occasion to use a Windows machine and Sublime has versions for both OSX and Windows.</p>

<p>Oh and finally I occasionally need a more complex drawing. The Wacom Bamboo Stylus + Lekh Diagrams on the iPad seems to be a great combo. My drawing skills blow, I really like how Lekh Diagrams autocorrects my rectangles, triangles, circles, etc.</p>
