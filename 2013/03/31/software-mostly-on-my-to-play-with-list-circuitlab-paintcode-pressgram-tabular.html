  <li><a href="www.circuitlab.com">CircuitLab</a> – worth watching. Today it is kind of a toy, but if this could grow, say, into a tool that would let me design and emulate SOC-based systems, and then outsource the parts supply, circuit board mfr, and even assembly of them, well that could be cool.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.paintcodeapp.com">PaintCode</a> – if I was doing iOS/osx app development, this seems like a must have. Laying out visuals and then creating all the boilerplate framework is tedious and boring.</li>
  <li><a href="http://pressgr.am">Pressgram</a> – Love this idea. Never understand why people gift content to other branded services, this lets people own and control their own content.</li>
  <li><a href="http://store.someecards.com">Some Ecards Store</a> – I’d like to buy a bunch of the coffee mugs and stock our office with them.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/26/tabular-tablature-editor-for-the-mac/">Tabular</a> – I don’t have enough time (or, to be honest, enough skill) to engage in my secret desire to compose music, but if I did…</li>
  <li><a href="https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/">2 factor Apple ID auth</a> – purportedly you can turn this on but it has been a failure for me, apple claims i set some security question answers that i have never seen before, and now I am locked out of my account after too many tries. Awesome.</li>
