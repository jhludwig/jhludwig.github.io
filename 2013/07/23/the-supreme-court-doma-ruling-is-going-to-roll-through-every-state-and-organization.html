<p>In Ohio, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/07/a-new-same-sex-marriage-ruling-in-ohio/">a federal judge rules that Ohio has to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states.</a> This is going to roll through every state, company, organization, municipality. If it is unconstitutional for the federal government to discriminate against legally married couples, then it is surely unconstitutional for any other entity to do the same. Great news. If I was a responsible party at a government entity or a company, Iâ€™d make sure my organization was in compliance now, no point in waiting for the inevitable lawsuit.</p>
