<p>Updated my Python install and NumPy/SciPy on my Mountain Lion machine. A couple of sites provided great guidance:</p>

<p>* “Python, NumPy, SciPy instructions”:http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2011/installing-python-numpy-scipy-matplotlib-and-ipython-on-lion/ provide good guidance on getting python, brew, virtualenv, and bumpy up to date on osx 10.8. The scipy instructions are busted tho * “SciPy instructions on StackOverflow”:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12092306/how-to-install-scipy-with-pip-on-mac-mountain-lion-os-x-v10-8. Once you have Python and Numpy installed, these steps solved the SciPy install. OK well no they didn’t. Still working on. * UPDATE: Back to a later post from the first author: “Compiling SciPy on Mountain Lion”:http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2012/compiling-scipy-on-mountain-lion/ – and I have SciPy working now.</p>
