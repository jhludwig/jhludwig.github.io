I can feel my macbook heat up and i can watch the battery drain! Pretty stunning what you can do with webgl.</p>

<p>I am trying to figure out the best practice for integrating webgl with a webpage, in particular text. Overlay of CSS/HTML on a webgl element? Stuffing the text right into the webgl? Does the next version of webgl change anything? What lib to use on top of wegbl to make this easier?</p>

<p>Historical aside – what a huge missed opportunity for Microsoft, read for instance <a href="http://www.alexstjohn.com/WP/2013/07/25/the-advent-of-web-3d/">Alex St John’s story of the early days of really expressive content on the web</a>. Microsoft had a browser code-named Chrome in the 90s that had the idea of webgl built into it. Sadly internal machinations killed it – political infighting about ownership of graphics leadership within the company, and a lack of vision in senior management – not enough people were excited about the idea of a browser and web content that brought a PC to its knees, failing to understand that thanks to Moore’s Law, this problem would go away within a short time.</p>
