Back in my active Halloween days, I used to spend a lot of time figuring out how to turn simple rotary motion (as available from a myriad cheap motors) into some form of erratic or lateral motion. Or lateral motion (as available from a pneumatic piston) into some other form of motion. I have the 4 volume set of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ingenious-Mechanisms-Designers-Inventors-4-Volume/dp/0831110848/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376840380&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ingenious+mechanisms">Ingenious Mechanisms</a>, which is even more excellent. But the 507 site is free!</p>
