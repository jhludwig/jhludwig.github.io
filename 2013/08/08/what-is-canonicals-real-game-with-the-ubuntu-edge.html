<p>I donâ€™t think the Canonical guys are stupid, and it would have taken about 4 seconds of analysis to figure out that a $32M crowd funding campaign was not going to ever work. So I assume they already knew that. So what is their game?</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are getting lots of free press for themselves and for the idea of a Ubuntu phone, so that is good for them.</li>
  <li>If they had no intention of ever producing this phone, or seeing it produced, it would be dumb to stir up excitement and interest.</li>
  <li>So I assume that there is a plan, regardless of the Indiegogo campaign, to get this phone produced.</li>
  <li>Canonical may be using the press and interest to raise capital via other channels, that would make sense.</li>
  <li>Or they may have a partner on the hook to produce the phone, and the partner needs a little goading.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way or another, I suspect this phone is coming out, or something very much like it.</p>
