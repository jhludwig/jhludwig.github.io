<p>Hey, it was a great day already watching OSU walk all over Purdue and avoid a stumble. The defense was great, the offense was great, that <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1834734-ohio-state-qb-braxton-miller-flips-ball-to-wr-for-a-td-vs-purdue">little ad-hoc flip pass</a> that Braxton threw for a td was glorious.</p>

<p>And then Michigan just put the cherry on the top. You can glory in all the hair-pulling and teeth-gnashing over at <a href="http://mgoblog.com/content/michigan-state-29-michigan-6#comments">mgoblog</a>, but the highlight has to be Michigan’s all time rushing yardage low of -48 yards. That kind of futility doesn’t come easy, you have to really work at it.</p>
