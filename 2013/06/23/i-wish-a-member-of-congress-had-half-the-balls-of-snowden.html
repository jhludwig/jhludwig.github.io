<p>However you feel about Snowden’s actions, whether he is a patriot or traitor, brilliant or naive, you have to give him credit for having the balls to take a stand. <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bunnyhat.jpg"><img src="images/bunnyhat.jpg" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/insouciance/" /></a>He has put his life and liberty at risk for something he believes in. He has thrown away his career, his relationships, his home, everything. I’m not completely sure how I feel about all his actions, though I have a strong bias towards more openness and more government accountability and more transparent oversight. But I certainly admire his courage.</p>

<p>Contrast with <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/06/intelligence-committee-wyden-snowden-came.php">members of Congress who apparently were afraid to break a subcommittee rule.</a> Gosh, what happens if you break a subcommittee rule, do you have to sit at the wrong table at lunch, or do you lose your parking pass, or do you have to wear a funny hat on Thursdays? It must be horrific.</p>
