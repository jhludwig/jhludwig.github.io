<p>ios7 first impressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the mail app i think i will like, seems a little easier to dispose of messages, and viewing messages is a lot cleaner</li>
  <li>i never used game center, mostly because i don’t care about the feature, but a little bit because it was so horribly ugly. nice to see that fixed</li>
  <li>sometimes you can be too subdued and too flat. the weather app doesn’t work for me, the difference between a sunny and rainy forecast is now so muted.</li>
  <li>all the new swipe from the bottom, side, etc behavior will take a while to get used to. tho quick access to airplane mode is nice.</li>
  <li>i’m interested in the new photo library features and sharing, tho at first glance, the whole collection thing doesn’t really work for me. collections are too small or too big.</li>
  <li>i hope i can airdrop easily between my mac and my phone. haven’t tried that yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>osx first impressions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>laggy. wish i hadn’t installed. i am sure it will get better.</li>
  <li>maps app is cool i guess tho i will have to see how much i use it versus the browser alternatives. the “send to iOS” feature will be great, obviously not a new idea, but still i will be happy with.</li>
  <li>i suspect i will like finder tabs a lot. tags? i just don’t know. evidence from other domains suggests i won’t use them.</li>
  <li>books, keychain – yawn. hard to get excited about when there are great 3rd party solutions that work everywhere.</li>
</ul>
