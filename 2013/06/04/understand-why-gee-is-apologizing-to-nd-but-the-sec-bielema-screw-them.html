<p>Geeâ€™s comments about ND were stupid and <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/9335760/ohio-st-president-gordon-gee-apologizes-big-ten-comments-notre-dame-sec">deserve an apology</a>.</p>

<p>And SEC academic quality vs the Big10? Look at the <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/spp+50">USNews rankings</a>. Northwestern &gt; Vanderbilt. UM, Wisconsin, Illinois, PSU in top 50. OSU, MD in in top 60. Purdue, Rutgers, Minnesota, Iowa, MSU in top 75. Florida is first SEC showing (after Vandy) at 54, Georgia at 63, A&amp;M at 65. It is kind of a rout in favor of the Big10 actually. Gee just said the truth. Might be painful and indiscreet but seems true.</p>
