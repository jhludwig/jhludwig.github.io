<p>I’m a backer of <a href="http://kck.st/12pALEG">the Poppy</a> – I went for the microfiber bag level. Great to see a Seattle team doing well.</p>

<p>And what the heck, while I was at it, I backed the <a href="http://kck.st/11KVrxM">Openbeam Kossel Pro 3d printer</a> – another Seattle team. I saw this printer at the mini Maker Faire here, it looks totally awesome.</p>
