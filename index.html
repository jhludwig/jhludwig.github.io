				<p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192631651-the-man-who-saw-seconds">The Man Who Saw Seconds</a> by Alexander Boldizar.  Interesting premise about a man who sees seconds into the future, and kind of processes all the possible futures in a quantum computing way.  Turns out to be a curse, not a gift.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58438464-the-next-civil-war">The Next Civil War: Dispatches from the American Future</a> by Stephen Marche.  Slop.  Needed an editor.  A mishmash of musings, occasionally some facts, a lot of outrage mongering.  Not worth the time.  Contrast with Annie Jacobsen’s Nuclear War book, which is well researched and well structured.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15981702-full-rip-9-0">Full Rip 9.0: The Next Big Earthquake in the Pacific Northwest</a> by Sandi Doughton.  Not as definitive as I had hoped, but I guess that is the state of the science.  I’m left wanting to do more earthquake prep but not really clear on what the chances are.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214269337-raising-hare">Raising Hare:A Memoir</a> by Chloe Dalton. Lovely tale about becoming an accidental caretaker and companion to a wild hare.  Much to learn in here about love, patience, giving.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198471321-capitalism-and-its-critics">Capitalism and its Critics</a> by John Cassidy.  Initially this book was compelling.   The structure sucked me in — rather than criticizing capitalism, the author is simply presenting what people have said.  It is a clever way to open the reader’s mind to criticism.   But the book broke me with overwhelming detail on the critic’s lives.   Do I need to know that Marx had carbuncles to understand his criticism?</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3636.The_Giver">The Giver</a> by Lois Lowry.  Yawn.  I’m too old.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108829.Comfortable_with_Uncertainty">Comfortable with Uncertainty</a> by Pema Chodron.  It is probably not a good sign that I find myself too impatient with this book to really enjoy it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108829.Comfortable_with_Uncertainty">The Light Brigade</a> by Kameron Hurley.  Eh, pretty trite SF stuff</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221633230-never-flinch">Never Flinch</a> by Stephen King.  Solid mystery, not as good as his horror work.</li>
</ul>

				<p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150249463-the-tainted-cup">The Tainted Cup</a> by Robert Jackson Bennett.  Fantastic mystery set in a fantasy world.  Great characters for the lead investigator and assistant.  I will absolutely read more in the series.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77265021">Nuts and Bolts</a> by Roma Agrawal.  Wanted to love this but it was just a bit boring.  Maybe I was too familiar with the material.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220239019-vera-or-faith">Vera, or Faith</a> by Gary Shteyngart.  A little “Harriet the Spy”-ish, in a near future slightly dystopic America.  Kind of predictable but still touching.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784260-some-desperate-glory">Some Desparate Glory</a> by Emily Tesh.  Couldn’t finish, pretty routine “gifted teens in a special academy have to grow up fast” story.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214143824-rose-house">Rose/House</a> by Arkady Martine.  A cautionary tale about AI, kind of weird.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62952125-somebody-s-fool">Somebody’s Fool</a> by Richard Russo.  Imagine a maypole dance, with a lot of people who are slightly tipsy and have never done a maypole dance before.  That is this story.  By the end, everyone’s life is smashed together and intertwined.  Very enjoyable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200196195-phantom-orbit">Phantom Orbit</a> by David Ignatius.   Supposedly a thriller, but pretty light on the thrills.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6033525-the-indifferent-stars-above">The Indifferent Stars Above: The Harrowing Saga of a Donner Party Bride</a> by Daniel James Brown.  Oof.  Humans are reliably nuts.  They had so many chances to stop, to turn around, to live.  But were so committed to the idea of getting to California.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210384823-shroud">Shroud</a> by Adrian Tchaikovsky.  Kind of like The Martian but with a way more hostile environment.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10644930-11-22-63">11/22/63</a> by Stephen King.  Time travel story centered around the JFK assassination.  About 30% more pages than I would have liked, but I knew that going in.</li>

				<p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59568617-american-psychosis">American Psychosis</a> by David Corn.  OK this book annoyed me.  1) It is a bit of a screed; no one who doesn’t already agree with the author is going to be swayed.  2) He puts all the blame for the Republican Party behaviour on some of the politicians in the party – but not on the voters who put them in office.  3) There is no recognition of the part the Democratic Party has played; voters have opted for some bad Republican choices because they are angry at Democratic choices and Democratic party behaviour.  Not a helpful book.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952341-the-grace-of-kings">The Grace of Kings</a> by Ken Liu.  Entertaining, Game of Thrones-light.  All the drama and intrigue in one fast-paced story.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114545-too-like-the-lightning">Too Like The Lightning</a> by Ada Palmer.  An interesting political setup, ruined by all kinds of literary and romantic overhead.  I am sad I read the whole book.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104023.The_Big_Book_of_Secret_Hiding_Places">The Big Book of Secret Hiding Places</a> by Jack Luger.  Not that big, but has some creative ideas.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217432753-the-ai-con">The AI Con</a> by Emily Bender and Alex Hanna.  I gave up 20 pages in.  The authors are so bent against technology and innovation, I simply didn’t trust anything they said.  I’d be interested in more rational critiques of AI.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933306-stolen-focus">Stolen Focus</a> by Johann Hari.  75% of this book is great.  Allowing oursleves to get into flow state, making the changes in our how we spend our time, helping our kids to grow these skills and have better lives – all great stuff, and all researched well.  Then he spends the last chapter on a degrowth rant for which he has done no research, and applied no critical thinking.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4952.What_Is_the_What">What is the What</a> by Dave Eggers.  A novelized biography of Valentino Achak Deng, a Sudanese refugee who came to the US.  Amazing story of survival and perseverance.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222796693-cross-purposes">Cross Purposes: Christianity’s Broken Bargain with Democracy</a> by Jonathan Rauch.  A thoughtful look at the failure of American Christianity to live up to its democratic ideals, and how it can do better.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220160840-separation-of-church-and-hate">Separation of Church and Hate: A Sane Person’s Guide to Taking Back the Bible from Fundamentalists, Fascists, and Flock-Fleecing Frauds</a> by John Fugelsang.  A sharper and more pointed look at the same topic as Rauch.  Good info on how to counter bad biblical interpretations, but a little snarky.</li>

				<p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13689443-philosophical-devices">Philosophical Devices</a> by David Papineau.  I probably would have loved this at a younger age, but a little too “angels on the head of a pin” for me now.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57132832-the-lyrics">The Lyrics</a> by Paul McCartney.  We may never get an autobiography from him, but this is pretty dang close.  Stories about the songs and where he was in his life when he wrote them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85908812-man-s-search-for-meaning">Man’s Search for Meaning</a> by Viktor E. Frankl.  A classic, and a must-read for anyone who has ever struggled with the meaning of life.  I am motivated to read more on logotherapy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62707931-the-cult-of-creativity">The Cult of Creativity</a> by Samuel Weil Franklin.  Interesting history on how recently the idea of creativity has entered our thinking, and what a strong corporate background it has.  Kind of ran out of steam, and but worth a quick read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198276006-i-cheerfully-refuse">I Cheerfully Refuse</a> by Leif Enger.  Great tale of loss, adventure, and reawakening.  I also love anything set in the Great Lakes region.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213324913-safecracker">Safecracker</a> by Jesse DeRoy.   A solid thriller about a safecracker who gets sucked into a spiraling series of events.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime">Born a Crime</a> by Trevor Noah.  Wow, what an upbringing.  How Noah managed to climb from these beginnings is an amazing story.  And somehow still maintains his humor and positivity.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217245583-things-become-other-things">Things Become Other Things</a> by Craig Mod.  A travelogue, observations on the changes in a beautiful part of Japan, and a reflection on a long lost friend.  Interesting juxtaposition – admirable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/191746386-the-wide-wide-sea">The Wide Wide Sea</a> by Hampton Sides.  The tale of Captain Cook’s final voyage.  Entertaining, and a good look at life on a ship in the 1700s.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61812308-small-mercies">Small Mercies</a>] by Dennis Lehane.  A gritty, hard-boiled detective story set in Boston in the 1970s.  Lehane has gotten even better over time, this is an excellent read.</li>

				<p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird">Bird By Bird</a> by Anne Lamott.  Brilliant advice from a writer to writers.  One of the best books on working I have ever read, this is not just about writing.  Progress in anything requires daily attention, willingness to try and fail, constant iteration, and an openness to input and criticism.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61431922-fourth-wing">Fourth Wing</a> by Rebecca Yarros.  You know the sort of book – young person goes to a school for magic, much intrigue follows.  More sex than Harry Potter.  Nothing particularly new.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56135066-cecil-rhodes">Cecil Rhodes: Flawed Colossus</a> by Brian Roberts.  I did not like this biography.  It treats Rhodes and his contemporaries as almost cartoon characters, with almost comical or farcical behaviour.  I do not believe this is fair or interesting.  Human nature and human IQ has not fundamentally changed over the past 150 years.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220291748-apple-in-china">Apple in China: The Capture of the World’s Greatest Company</a> by Patrick McGee.  Excellemt book about Apple’s corporate history.   You will be mad at someone after reading this book.   It might be China, it might be Apple, it might be the US government.  Or maybe all 3!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8539049-diary-of-a-very-bad-year">Diary of a Very Bad Year</a> by Keith Gessen.  A series of interviews with a hedge fund manager during the 2008 financial crisis.  A great reminder to self, the financial operators in the market are about 1000x smarter than I am about the market.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52617647-the-long-game">The Long Game</a> by Rush Doshi.  I wanted to like this book, but so pedantic and long-winded.  I gave up.  There is a nice magazine article in here somewhere.</li>

				<p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209563735-death-in-the-spires">Death In The Spires</a> by K.J. Charles.  Solid mystery set in early 1900s – a college friend is killed, his friends all scatter, but find themselves drawn back in 10 years later.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20186.Seeing_Like_a_State">Seeing Like A State</a> by James C. Scott.  States try some pretty typical and consistent patterns to improve their societies (and to serve the state), and they usually come to ruin.  A little long.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63933641-the-loom-of-time">The Loom of Time</a> by Robert D. Kaplan.  Excellent walkthrough of the history of the major countries in the Greater Middle East.  We tend to blend all these together, but there is complexity and richness here.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223436601-careless-people">Careless People</a> by Sarah Wynn-Williams.  Wow.  You can’t read this book and not be disgusted with Facebook.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22451908-the-revolt-of-the-public-and-the-crisis-of-authority">The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority</a> by Martin Gurri.  Outstanding assessment of the impact of the democratization of information and how it has eroded the legitimacy of authority.  And how the elites in traditional positions of authority (government, party, academia, corporate) are fighting to hang on to their power.  We still have a ways to go before we get to a new stable state in society.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216730681-king-dollar">King Dollar</a> by Paul Blustein.  A useful read on the dollar and its role; I would have enjoyed a little more analytical depth.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176444106-abundance">Abundance</a> By Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson.  I am clearly an abundance faction supporter.  We need leaders who embrace this view.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58416952-the-will-of-the-many">The Will Of The Many</a> by James Islington.  Fun kickoff to a fantasy series.  Pretty typical fantasy elements, but mostly well written and fun.</li>
</ul>

A thriller about a possible domestic terror threat which goes sideways.  Moments of fun but ultimately a little wearing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176443223-the-war-below">The War Below: Lithium, Copper, and the Global Battle to Power Our Lives</a> by Ernest Scheyder.  A good look at the state of lithium and rare earth mining in the US, and the tough balance we face between environmental concerns and the need for these materials.  We probably can’t continue to blindly outsource this issue to the rest of the world.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203956642-kingmaker">Kingmaker: Pamela Harriman’s Astonishing Life of Power, Seduction, and Intrigue</a> by Sonia Purnell.  Wow, I new very little about Pamela Harriman’s life.  Simply amazing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205309521-reentry">Reentry: SpaceX, Elon Musk, and the Reusable Rockets that Launched a Second Space Age</a> by Eric Berger.  Great book about SpaceX history and the development of the Falcon rockets and the rest of the SpaceX lineup.  I wish we had more of the Elon in this book and less of the Twitter/political Elon.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205062721-the-hidden-globe">The Hidden Globe: How Wealth Hacks the World</a> by Atossa Araxia Abrahamian.  Some interesting information about how bankers and lawyers move money around the world, but just kind of drags on.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214670079-pilgrim-machines">Pilgrim Machines</a> by Yudhanjaya Wijeratne.  Very fun romp through the galaxy as humanity expands towards the galactic center.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56335890-the-world-turned-upside-down">The World Turned Upside Down: America, China, and the Struggle for Global Leadership</a> by Clyde Prestowitz.  Ends on a strong note with strong policy recommendations for the US.  Along the way, it was sometimes a little too strident, but overall a worthy read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216351768-the-let-them-theory">The Let Them Theory</a> by Mel Robbins.  Would have been a nice blog post.  Not a book.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195790797-nobody-s-hero">Nobody’s Hero</a> by M. W. Craven.  Kind of a standard potboiler/thriller.  Not much innovation here.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321447-chip-war">Chip War</a> by Chris Miller.  This was ok, a lot of history I already knew.  A good summary if you want to catxh up with the industry.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74834673-morning-after-the-revolution">Morning After the Revolution</a> by Nellie Bowles.  Hilarious and sad, Bowles rips apart the worst excesses of the progressive movement.</li>

What a strange book – who is this book for?  The authors are trying for cute I guess, but come across as condescending.  There is a good list here of hard issues around space travel.  And it is certainly going to take a long time to figure out all these issues.  But these authors write like we shouldn’t even try.  I couldn’t finish it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62970022">Zero Days</a> by Ruth Ware.  I needed a thriller, this one was dumb.  I get annoyed when clearly smart characters act repeatedly in dumb ways to advance the plot.  I don’t know why I finished it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784729-biography-of-x">Biography of X</a> by Catherine Lacey.  Finishing the year on a strange one.  A widow digs into the multiple identities of her deceased wife, and it is never quite clear who her wife really was or who the widow is.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56405148">Stalin’s War: A New History of World War II</a> by Sean McMeekin.  An interesting new perspective on the war for me.  If you accept the book, Stalin played the rest of the Allies like a fiddle to achieve his goals, and there is some truth to that.  I didn’t realize just how generous the US was with lend-lease shipments to the USSR.  That said, I suspect the US was happy to have the USSR bear the brunt of casualties in the war at the expense of some material goods.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173754979-james">James</a> by Percivil Everett.  A fantastic retelling of Huck Finn.  Makes me want to reread the original.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182733784-nuclear-war">Nuclear War: A Scenario</a> by Annie Jacobsen.  Oof.  In case you are feeling a little too light and happy this week, pick this up.  Super depressing and even if unlikely, all too likely.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2054761.The_Snowball">The Snowball</a> by Alice Schroeder.  A biography of Warren Buffet, incredibly boring.  Couldn’t be bothered to finish it.  If you want interesting stuff about Warren Buffet, just read his shareholder letters.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75665850-clear-thinking">Clear Thinking</a> by Shane Parrish.  Would have been a great long magazine article.  Not really book length material, but a useful framework for thinking more clearly and avoiding common cognitive biases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6572062-the-last-report-on-the-miracles-at-little-no-horse">The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse</a> by Louise Erdrich.  This book gets great reviews, and the premise is compelling, but I gave up 30% of the way in.  I just didn’t care about any of the characters beyond the protagonist, and that wasn’t enough for me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60798157-butler-to-the-world">Butler to the World: The Book the Oligarchs Don’t Want You to Read - How Britain Helps the World’s Worst People Launder Money, Commit Crimes, and Get Away with Anything</a> by Oliver Bullough.  I didn’t realize how lax the UK was on money laundering relative to the US.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56791389-dungeon-crawler-carl">Dungeon Crawler Carl</a> byMatt Dinniman.  What a stupidly fun book.  Ridiculous, fast-paced, fun.  The whole series is a hoot.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199702772">All The Worst Humans</a> by Phil Elwood.  What a great look behidn the scenes of the PR industry.  I know some people don’t like the fact that the author participated all those years in supporting some bad actors, and only now tries to make amends, but it is a great look inside.  Very hard to trust any media!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138505710-doppelganger">Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World</a> by Naomi Klein.  An interesting journey into identify and the many ways we see ourselves and others see us. There were some intriguing parts but needed an editor.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57030638-woke-inc">Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam</a> by Vivek Ramaswamy.  I kind of had to ignore the author name as I read this book.  It is better written and argued than I expected.  However, there are 3 fundamental issues with the book. First, the author complete conflates human venality and corruption with being “woke”.  Humanity has abused power forever, humans are venal and petty and self-interested and will grasp at tools to expand and abuse their power.  That has been going on forever, there is nothing new about it.  Of course in the current world, some will grab the levers of “woke” and use that to their advantage, but it would be some other lever if not that.  So I too get enraged about abuse and corruption, but I don’t lay it on the doorstep of “woke”.  Secondly, the author confuses “woke” and “a\(hole". There are plenty of a\)holes in the world, and some of them will be for and against some elements of social justice.  It is not an indictment of social justice concepts that there are a\(holes involved with part of it, nor is it a refutation of social justice if anti-"woke" a\)hole faces some consequences.  Finally,  he is very critical of corporations having political views, and critical of money in politcs, but never touches the Citizens United ruling and its implications.  I too might wish that corporations had no politcal voice and that money did not equal speech but that is not the system we have created.  You can’t demand that one behaviour stop while ignoring the root cause.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/207300960-creation-lake">Creation Lake</a> by Rachel Kushner.  Yet again a Booker prize nominee that I don’t like. Perhaps it is cleverly and uniquely written, but it is just dull.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89635.How_the_Universe_Got_Its_Spots">How the Universe Got Its Spots: Diary of a Finite Time in a Finite Space</a> by Janna Levin.  A very very high level introduction to cosmology and topology.  And a nice introspective tale of the author’s life and growth.  Very enjoyable.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24895661-neurotribes">NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity</a> by Steve Silberman. A very interesting look at the history of autism and the many ways it has been treated and understood. We have come a logn way from treating autistics as mentally ill.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102720.Roman_Blood">Roman Blood</a> by Steven Saylor.  A historical mystery set in ancient Rome.  Quite the page turner.  Apparently a lot of true history in here.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117833.The_Master_and_Margarita">The Master and Margarita</a> by Mikhail Bulgakov.  Very well regarded, but I may not be Russian enough, and I do not like farce.   Hard to get into.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195790867-moonbound">Moonbound</a> by Robin Sloan.  There are a few books that let you peek into a vast strange world and have a fun adventure, and hint at much much more.  The Hobbit was one of those books for me.  This is another.  A fascinating world, a classic hero’s tale, just a lot of fun.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37922709-on-desperate-ground">On Desperate Ground</a> by Hampton Sides.  The story of the Chosin Reservoir campaign in the Korean War.  A brutal story, a brutal war.  War sucks, and hubris and incompetence make it suck more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40265841-finding-dorothy">Finding Dorothy</a> by Elizabeth Letts.  I am on the fence here.   I did finish the book, but I never really felt like I found Dorothy.  There is a story in here somewhere about how Dorothy is a representation of the women in Baum’s life, but it never quite clicked for me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55475687-advanced-portfolio-management">Advanced Portfolio Management: A Quant’s Guide for Fundamental Investors</a> by Giuseppe Paleologo.  Solid and short explanation of the mathematical basics of portfolio management.  The math is not intimidating at all, a good read.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60372350-steel-fear">Steel Fear</a> by Brandon Webb and John David Mann.  Super fun thriller, reminds me a little of the Alistair MacLean books I loved as a kid, only more modern and better depth.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389431-seven-blades-in-black">Seven Blades in Black</a> by Sam Sykes.  So I enjoyed this as escapist fare, but it is annoying that every chapter seems to feature an even more fearsome enemy, and the hero discovers a power every chapter that just happens to top that enemy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58353189-a-half-built-garden">A Half-Built Garden</a> by Ruthanna Emrys.  An interesting exploration of a eco friendly future, but WAAAAY too long.  Too much description, not enough story.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139506512-the-holocaust">The Holocaust: An Unfinished History</a> by Dan Stone.  Not a happy book at all!  A re-examination of the Holocaust, how widespread the perpetrators were, and how it there are still echoes in our societies today.</li>

				<p class="blog-post__subtitle">15 June 2024</p>
			</div>

			
			<a href="/blog/illiberal" class="blog-post__image" style="background-image: url(/images/blog/illiberal-rabbits.png);"></a>
			

			<div class="blog-post__content">
				<p><p>I’ve been reading a bit about the notion of “illiberal liberalism” that people talk about.  For instance this article – https://themissingdatadepot.substack.com/p/higher-educations-illiberal-liberalism.</p>

<p>I appreciate the effort the author went through, it is a useful article.  I don’t really know what is going on on campuses, so I can’t really speak to some of the concerns of the article.  But to me, the article has a large blindspot, which I can best illustrate by talking about my own political progression.</p>

<p>I grew up in a staunch conservative household, in a conservative part of Ohio.  Voting for Republicans was just assumed.  As a kid I lived through Kent State, Watergate, Vietnam protests, all of which planted some seeds of skepticism about Republicans and the government more generally.  I watched coverage of Kent State on the news and remember asking my parents why the government was shooting at students.  The CSNY song “Ohio” still haunts me.  I watched Nixon step down.  I watched coverage of running tear gas battles on the OSU campus.  None of that gave me trust in our government, but I still leaned Republican.  The traditional Republican conservative ideals of small government, fiscal responsibility, business friendly, strong defense – those all seemed good to me.</p>

<p>As I aged, my skepticism of authority and government grew.  And the Republican party changed.  It is certainly not the party of fiscal responsibility any more.  But more importantly, the Republicans increasingly embraced intrusive and intolerant social policies.  They sided with the anti-same-sex marriage forces.  They sided with the abortion prohibition groups.  Both these policies are the government intruding into personal business, and into some of the most important personal business of people’s lives.  I don’t care what marriages other people have.  I am fine with some churches saying that they don’t want to perform same-sex marriages, but if other churches want to perform those marriages, A-OK by me, and the government should respect all marriages.  On abortion – no one wants to see more abortions, but it is not anyone’s business besides the parents and their doctors.  Now the Republicans are embracing anti-Trans positions.  I don’t care what adults decide to do about gender identity and their body, it doesn’t affect me.</p>

<p>I have some other beefs about Republican policies but these above are what broke me.  I cannot even consider a Republican candidate until they walk away from these intolerant positions.  I am certainly not a Democrat, the Democrats have some of the stupidest policy ideas ever, but I cannot support the Republican party today.</p>

<p>So back to the article about illiberal liberalism.  There may well be some really intolerant liberals – and I am not surprised I guess, given the intolerant social positions embraced by the mainstream conservatives.  I can understand the anger towards conservatives.  I personally wouldn’t bother trying to silence these conservatives, I’d let them broadcast their desired social policies and let the electorate vote with their feet.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60568507-for-profit">For Profit: A History of Corporations</a> by William Magnuson.  I thought this was going to be a much more detailed book.  The long anecdotes about some major corporate structure innovations throughout history were interesting, but ultimately I felt a little unsatisfied.  The last chapter admonitions were just pablum – “corporations shouldn’t do the bad things that some did in the past”.   I was hoping for more meat – a look at some bleeding edge corp structures, a deeper look at the law and regulation, etc.  It is an OK book but left me wanting more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33358751-priestdaddy">PriestDaddy: A Memoir</a> by Patricia Lockwood.  Enjoyable at first but kidn of went nowhere and started to feel repetitive.  The window into life with a priest father was interesting for a while.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74846917-spies">Spies: The Epic Intelligence War Between East and West</a> by Calder Walton.  A walk through the history of British, US, Soviet, Russian, and Chinese spying.  The main theme is the asymmetry between the approaches of the democratic west and the autocratic nations, and the dangers for the west.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127305853-the-women">The Women</a> by Kristin Hannah.  An odd meld of a romance novel and a gritty tale of vietnam service and its after effects.  I loved the vietnam part.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133287277-smoke-and-ashes">Smoke and Ashes: Opium’s Hidden Histories</a> by Amitav Ghosh.  The story of the opium trade and its impact primarily on India and China, but also Britain and the US.  A lot of great detail on just how pervasive and impactful the trade was.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18634818-red-plenty">Red Plenty</a> by Francis Spufford.  A fictionalized account of the Soviet Union’s attempts to create a planned economy that would outperform the west, he book is a mix of real history and fictionalized accounts of the people involved.  Interesting and humanizing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127463547-first-lie-wins">First Lie Wins</a> by Ashley Elston.  Super fun thriller jaunt, where everyone is morally gray.  Supposedly coming to Hulu.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/177059687-cahokia-jazz">Cahokia Jazz</a> by Francis Spufford.  Finest novel I have read in some time, the reimagining of America is fascinating and vivid.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61222788-outlive">Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity</a> by Peter Attia.  I am glad I dabbled in this book.  There are some interesting concepts and ideas in here.  But gosh a terrible and boring book.  Really this should not be a book but should be an app that injests your DNA sequence and medical tests, and gives you a plan on how to live longer and healthier.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145624807-third-millennium-thinking">Third Millenium Thinking: Creating Sense in a World of Nonsense</a> by Saul Perlmutter, Robert MacCoun, John Campbell.  A nice toolset for thinking about problems in a structured way.  Would be a great 30 page article, the book is stuffed with extra words to get to book length.</li>

				<p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59838811-upgrade">Upgrade</a> by Blake Crouch.  Fun bio hackign adventure, not really much new in here tho.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61237044-infinity-gate">Infinity Gate</a> by M. R. Carey.  Fun multiple universe romp, a lot of interesting ideas.  I do wish the author had written a smaller story, not every book needs to be part of a universe-ending trilogy.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61783804-dust">Dust: The Modern World in a Trillion Particles</a> by Jay Owens.  Interesting, infuriating, disagreeable, insightful.  I learned a lot about some ecological disasters – the Aral Sea, the Dust Bowl, etc.  I was intrigued by some of the recovery projects underway.  I was annoyed by some of the degrowth talk, an unrealistic approach.  I was confused about the tie to climate change, as the author points out that dust loads were much higher at times in prehistory, and that climate change may be largely a function of sun cycles and orbital oscillations.  Overall, intriguing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37649549-tailspin">Tailspin: The People and Forces Behind America’s Fifty-Year Fall–and Those Fighting to Reverse It</a> by Steven Brill.  A sometimes-too-long exploration of how the middle class has declined, how the rich have gotten richer, how our political systems have failed us.  A lot of data and anecdotes.  The author is ultimately optimistic but gosh it is a rough and sad tale.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25515725-barbarian-days">Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life</a> by William Finnegan.  What a great book. More detail about surfing than I ever wanted (I don’t surf), but all shared in a way that was compelling.  And man, the author’s life choices, a set of choices that I could never have imagined making, chasing after his surfing compulsion.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358103-money">Money: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing</a> by Jacob Goldstein.  A breezy and brief history of money.  Not the deepest story but does a nice job of intuitively explaining how money is a social construct.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65211701-system-collapse">System Collapse</a> by Martha Wells.  I loved the prior murderbot books, but this one didn’t cut the mustard.  Strays away from the unique murderbot characteristics and is a generic space adventure.</li>
