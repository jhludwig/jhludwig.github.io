<p><a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/008182.php">Will you see all 120 teams play in 2009? : Fanblogs College Football Blog</a>. I’ve been wondering about this as a goal as well – just seeing a quarter of play from each team. Over 14 weeks of regular season, this is just seeing 4+ games a weekend IF you can magically pick all the games that cover all the teams. Going to need to pay careful attention to the Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday night games to pick up all the lesser programs.</p>

<p>This weekend alone I will aspire to see parts of</p>

<p>* South Carolina/NC State * Utah/Utah State * Oregon/Boise State * Minnesota/Syracuse * Ohio State/Navy * Georgia/Ok State * SJSU/USC * Missouri/Illinois * Oklahoma/BYU * Alabama/VT * Maryland/Cal * LSU/UW * Colorado State/UC * Cincy/Rutgers * Miami FL/FSU</p>

<p>OK I probably won’t get all but that would be 30 teams right there. Of course the only somewhat obscure programs would be Utah State, SJSU, and Colorado State.</p>

<p>Perhaps my goal should be to just see the BCS teams – that is 66 teams, a very doable goal. And probably less painful than having to watch lower-division Sunbelt conference teams.</p>
