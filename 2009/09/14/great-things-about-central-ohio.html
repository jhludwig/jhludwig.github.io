<p>* “L&amp;P Cake and Candy Shoppe”:http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=bakery+bellefontaine+marion+ohio&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;gl=us&amp;cid=1148308129879636741&amp;li=lmd. Seriously maybe the best frosted sugar cookie ever. * “Crum Strawberry Farm”:http://www.pickyourown.org/OHcolumbus.htm. After eating their strawberries, I resolve to never buy grocery story strawberries again. * The entire scene Saturday night at the Horseshoe. The tailgating, the friends and family, the stadium, the game. Tough ending but what a night. I thought last year’s Penn State game was the craziest ever but this was over the top. We sat down for maybe 5 minutes the entire game, the south stands were hopping all night long</p>
