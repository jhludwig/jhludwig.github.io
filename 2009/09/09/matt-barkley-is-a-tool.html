<p>OK OK, Pryor has made some ill-considered comments this week, but he is not alone. <a href="http://menofthescarletandgray.com/2009/09/09/fill-in-the-blank/">MOTSAG</a> has these choice words from Matt Barkley:</p>

<p>Among other things, Barkley was asked by a reporter on the field what he had learned about himself as a quarterback.</p>

<p>“That this is fun. This is easy. This is what I was made to do,” Barkley said.</p>

<p>I asked Barkley if there was anything that was difficult.</p>

<p>“The run up the tunnel at halftime,” he said. “That was brutal.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the Buckeyes can provide him some lessons in humility on Saturday. All in the name of helping his further development as a person.</p>
