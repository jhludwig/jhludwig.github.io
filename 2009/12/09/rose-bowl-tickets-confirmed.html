<p>Hurray, got the mail from the ticket office today, we’ll be there. Not like it was hard to get them – apparently the alums didn’t snap up all the tix as there will be a <a href="http://blog.dispatch.com/buckeyesblog/2009/12/public_sale_for_rose_bowl_tick.shtml">public sale</a>.</p>

<p>As Rose Bowl prep, some reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.thebuckeyebattlecry.com/?p=3936">nice primer on Rose Bowl and bowl system history</a>. There is no NCAA football championship, the bowls are not about a championship. Important to remember as we get into the silly season now with everyone gnashing and wailing about the BCS.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/64318">Bowl gifts</a>. Pretty standardized across all the games at this point.</li>
  <li>OSU 7-0 all time against Oregon, yay!</li>
  <li>But the <a href="http://blog.blockonation.com/2009/12/2010-rose-bowlohio-state-vs-oregon.html">Oregon trolls are out in force in the comments here</a></li>
  <li>The Rose Bowl is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ducks_bowl_game_history">pretty rarefied air for Oregon</a> – their usual destinations are El Paso, San Diego, Las Vegas, etc.  Welcome to the big time.</li>
</ul>
