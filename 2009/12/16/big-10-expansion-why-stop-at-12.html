<p>Blogs and tweets galore today about <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=4745381">Big 10 expansion</a> – the discussion all centering on who should be the 12th team, particularly if not ND?</p>

<p>I’m not in love with the idea of expansion, but if it is going to happen…it is all about money. If ND won’t join in, no single other school will make a real contribution to TV viewership. So why stop at 12 teams? Pick up 3 or 5 and really increase TV footprint. Again assuming ND won’t play:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If 3, go after Rutgers, BC, Syracuse. Good schools, pick up major East Coast interest. BC can’t be that committed to the ACC. Syracuse is a great bball program and can be a great football program. Rutgers is the weakest but the potential TV market is huge. And this expansion would be big big news and would drive interest.</li>
  <li>If 5, add in Pitt for sure. Not thrilled about WVU as the last add, no population base for TV or recruiting. What about UConn?</li>
</ul>

<p>These would be dramatic moves but if the Big10 wants to grab the spotlight again, a one team expansion of someone besides ND is just not going to do it. It is a “me too” move and pretty boring.</p>

<p>OK two more crazy ideas, but in the vein of “let’s get the spotlight of football back on the Big 1o”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 2 weekend playoff at end of season. Trim off one game from 12-game schedule, have two play-in games from the top 4 teams. Pair up everyone else in seed order for a final 12th game.</li>
  <li>Heck with eastern expansion, merge with the Pac-10. The Pac-10 tv offering sucks, the BTEN network could pick up all the Pac-10 content and Pac-10 footprint.</li>
</ul>

<p>Point being, if you can’t get ND, don’t screw around with half-measures. Go big or go home.</p>
