<p>Good basic article on <a href="www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~kphang/ece1371/polymer.pdf">polymer circuits</a>. I need to learn more about charge transport in polymers, i have a basic understanding of charge transport in metals and semiconductors and ionic fluids, i donâ€™t really understand polymers. Polymer circuits potentially a research area for my future course work.</p>
