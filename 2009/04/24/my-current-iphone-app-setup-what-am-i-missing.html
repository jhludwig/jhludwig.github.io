<p>On the first page, apps I use every day, multiple times:</p>

<p>* Some of the default Apple apps – Mail, Text, Calendar, Safari (all on the bottom row); Weather, Stocks, Maps, Camera, Calculator (a recent promotion back to the first page, the landscape mode scientific calculator is handy now that I am taking courses at UW again), Settings (purely to switch radio on/off for flights), Clock (for alarm and cooking timing), Phone. * Facebook, Tweetie, Todo (synched with rememberthemilk for todo list management), Tripit (awesome for quick access to trip details – flight status, checkin codes, etc), Wordpress for blogging, Amazon.com. OK Amazon is probably going to fall off soon, I don’t do that much ordering while on the iphone. * 2 Across for nytimes crosswords, and Mafia Wars. Mafia Wars is fun tho the math in the game is kind of whack.</p>

<p>On the second page – apps that i need regular access to, or apps that I am trying out:</p>

<p>* App Store, Shazam (tagging music that I hear on the radio/etc), SmugShot (for access to my photos), MiGhtyDocs (google docs access) * Kayak and Flight Update tho they are declining is use thanks to the Tripit app * Pandora tho also declining in use as I am getting new music via other mechanisms * Trying out: Yelp, Air Sharing, SimpleMindX, FS5 Hockey, FriendCast, fring.</p>

<p>On the third page – apps I keep around because I have to or because I need them occasionally:</p>

<p>* Apple default apps Notes, Contacts, Photos, iTunes, iPod, YouTube. Can’t delete them, they have to go somewhere * Urbanspoon, GuitarToolkit – great apps but I don’t currently use that often. I tend to use google maps for finding restaurants instead of urban spoon * Wine Guide, Starmap, Drinks Free, Clinometer, Remote, Google Earth, RTM, Snaptell. All interesting but I rarely find a reason to use. RTM is just not as good as the Todo app</p>

<p>On the fourth page – games that I liked at one point but that are basically ignored now:</p>

<p>* Tetris, Trism, Bejeweled 2. I’ll still play bejeweled every once in a while * Vector Tanks, iShoot. * Pb Dreams, Flick Bowling, Monkey Ball, XOFootball. * Edge, touchPhysics, Koi Pond, Topple, Rolando, newtonica2. All cute. * Black and White. Pretty poor Othello game. * Dr. Awesome. Awesome actually.</p>
