<p>I could take the high road here and talk about the great character of the Ohio State team or the great athleticism they displayed…</p>

<p>…but it is way more fun to enjoy the misery of the PSU crowd –</p>

<ul>
  <li>teeth gnashing over at <a href="http://www.blackshoediaries.com/2009/11/8/1121355/and-here-come-the-pretzels">Black Shoe Diaries</a> – “Sifting through the rubble this morning, and nothing has changed. Yesterday’s game was an absolute owning of the home team – coaches, players, fans, offense, defense, special teams – from beginning to end.”</li>
  <li>declaring the season a total loss over at <a href="http://www.centredaily.com/sports/colleges/penn_state/football/story/1614802.html">CentreDaily</a> – “It probably took Ohio State’s Cameron Heyward, who had both Buckeye sacks, an extra 15 minutes in the showers to wash off the chunks of Clark left on his body from Saturday’s game.”</li>
</ul>

<p>This victory and our enjoyment of it will sow years of hatred for OSU in the PSU fanbase, which is of course one of the great things about college football.</p>
