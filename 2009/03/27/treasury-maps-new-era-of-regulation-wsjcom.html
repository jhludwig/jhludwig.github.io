<p>“That would drive managers out of the United States.” via <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123811201096853207.html">Treasury Maps New Era of Regulation - WSJ.com</a>.</p>

<p>So just wondering, why would driving hedge funds out of business in this country be a bad thing? How many inventions have they funded, how many jobs created? What is the biggest success story for the country to come out of a hedge fund? I know that individuals have certainly had some huge positive economic outcomes, but what has been the big positive outcome for the country? I may be completely ignorant about the big positive success stories, I need to learn.</p>
