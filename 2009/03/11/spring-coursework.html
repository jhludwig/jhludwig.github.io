<p>Continuing my educational adventure this spring:</p>

<p><strong>ME 568 Active and Sensing Materials</strong>:Â  Fundamental knowledge of the nano-structure property relations of active and sensing materials, and their devices. Examples of the active and sensing materials are: shape memory alloys (SMAs), ferromagnetic SMAs, ferroelectric, pyroelectric and piezoelectric materials, thermoelectrics, electroactive and conducting polymers, photoactive polymers, photovoltaics, and electrochromic materials.</p>

<p><strong>ME 518 Seminars on Advances in Manufacturing &amp; Management</strong>: Current topics and advances made in manufacturing and management. Topics presented by invited speakers from academia and industry. Emphasis on the multidisciplinary nature of manufacturing and management.</p>
