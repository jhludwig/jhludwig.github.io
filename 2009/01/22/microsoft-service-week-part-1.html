<p>Doing my part to help Microsoft avoid more layoffs this week. Firstly, been working thru <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=zune+error+code+C00D12F5&amp;hl=en">zune error code C00D12F5 - Google Search</a>. Some DRM config problem and all the published KB articles and forum pointers failed. Finally contacted the Zune guys directly and they were super helpful, even took my machine into their labs for a while. Turns out that somehow I had mismatched DRM components, they aren’t sure why, but forcing them all to the same version worked. Hopefully they will write up a KB article on. Zune guys were great to work with, here’s hoping they have future success.</p>
