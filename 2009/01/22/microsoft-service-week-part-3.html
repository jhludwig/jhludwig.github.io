<p>Installed the Win7 Beta1. I think MSFT will sell a ton of this. It just seems faster and cleaner than Vista. I haven’t played with new features yet – <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/technology/personaltech/22pogue.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=windows%207&amp;st=cse">early NYT review seems positive</a> – but glad that it seems crisp and uncluttered.</p>
