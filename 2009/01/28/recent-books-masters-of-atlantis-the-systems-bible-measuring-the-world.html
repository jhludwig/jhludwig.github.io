<p>* “Masters of Atlantis”:amazon by Charles Portis. Kept me engaged, but a lot of comic farce without a deeper meaning, and so ultimately forgettable. * “The Systems Bible”:amazon by John Gall. Recommended by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/">a very smart guy</a>, this is a great book on the foibles of designing and using large-scale systems, whether they be software, organizational, government, or whatever. Great book, wish I had read at age 25. * “Measuring the World”:amazon by Daniel Kehlmann. Two brilliant scientists struggle to make sense of the world and their lives, but never really figure out how to make human connections despite the efforts of so many around them. Very satisfying exploration of life’s meaning.</p>
