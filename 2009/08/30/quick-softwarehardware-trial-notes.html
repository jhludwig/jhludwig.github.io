<p>* <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com/wptouch/">WPTouch plugin</a> for wordpress is awesome. check out theludwigs.com from your iphone. * Messing around with <a href="http://www.slingmedia.com">Slingbox</a> finally. Works well tho I had to massively reconfig home network to get rid of routers – configuring to get through one router was reasonable; getting through two was nearly impossible; getting through the three I had in place would have required several PhDs. * <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/256">Download Manager Tweak</a>. Probably prefer download statusbar * <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5344418/make-firefox-faster-by-vacuuming-your-database">Vacuum your firefox db</a>. No idea if this actually did anything. Didn’t seem to make Firefox explode so I guess that is a plus. * <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/07/31/polymath-equals-user-innovatio/">Polymath</a>. Lots of great links to math formatting services for the web. * <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gliffy-plugin-for-wordpress/">Gliffy plugin for wordpress</a>. Seems like it could be useful as well.</p>
