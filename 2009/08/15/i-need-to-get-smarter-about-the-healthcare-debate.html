<p>Having spent way too much time with healthcare providers, insurance companies, etc, in the last 4 years, I certainly support change. Almost any change, change for change’s sake, is worth trying, because the system is not very satisfying right now. We should clearly try to do something. So I am inclined towards supporting the new proposals in Congress. I need to get smarter about the details.</p>

<p>In general, shifting power away from the monied interests – insurance companies, pharma companies, large healthcare organizations – and towards the individuals – patients and doctors – is the right thing to do. Do the proposals achieve this? I don’t know. Certainly <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2009665821_obama15.html">some insurance companies are pissed off</a> which is probably a good sign, tho <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/health/policy/16ads.html?ref=us">other pharma and insurance companies are funding support ads</a> which is concerning – if they are so excited about the proposals, it probably means money in their pockets, and that money is coming from someone.</p>

<p>I kind of hate the fact that all these large organizations – pharma, insurance cos, the various NGOs – are even participating in the discussion. My view is that only voters/citizens should participate, it should be illegal for all these other entities to fund ads and lobbying efforts.</p>
