<p><a href="http://blog.dispatch.com/buckeyesblog/2009/08/usa_today_poll_usc_4th_osu_6th.shtml">Preseason coaches poll is out, OSU at 6th, SC at 4th</a>. Man I am fired up for the opener against Navy in less than a month, and for the SC rematch.</p>

<p>Other teams and stories Iâ€™m excited about:</p>

<p>* Michigan. Can they take steps back to respectability? The best rivalry in sports needs drama to sustain itself. * SC. How good how fast, and will they learn to win the games they ought to win? * UW. My adoptive hometown team, will a new coach get them off the mat? * Florida. Hoping the rest of the SEC mans up and pins a couple losses on them. * Denison. Go Red Raiders! Only because a member of extended family is on the team.</p>
