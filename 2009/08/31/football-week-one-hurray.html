<p>Finally here. Here’s your reading for the day:</p>

<p>* Navy Football – know your enemy. <a href="http://www.navysports.com/sports/m-footbl/navy-m-footbl-body.html">Navy Sports</a>, <a href="http://thebirddog.wordpress.com/">The BirdDog</a>. * <a href="http://blog.dispatch.com/buckeyesblog/2009/08/miller_amos_top_new_osu_depth.shtml">OSU Depth chart out</a> and other goodies in the weekly PDF. * Because I can’t help it, a little USC preview – <a href="http://usc.freedomblogging.com/2009/08/31/usc-football-how-defenses-will-attack-matt-barkley/18879/">how to attack Barkley</a>.</p>

<p>Navy opens at a 21.5 point underdog. I don’t think OSU beats the spread, Tressel will keep the plan conservative. OSU 28, Navy 14.</p>
