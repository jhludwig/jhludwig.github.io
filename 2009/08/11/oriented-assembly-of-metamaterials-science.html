<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Such metamaterials may, for example, be used to create cloaking devices or light-based circuits based on manipulations of local optical electric fields rather than on the flow of electrons.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“The challenge now is to move from hit-or-miss assemblies of academic interest to the creation of technologically relevant devices that combine particle and patterned assembly via large-scale processes.”</em></p>

<p>It is this latter challenge I find most interesting.</p>
