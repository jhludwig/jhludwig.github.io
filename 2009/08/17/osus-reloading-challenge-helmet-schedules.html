<p>The BigTen Network has a <a href="http://www.bigtennetwork.com/sports/football/2009-Football-Watch-Lists.asp">nice page summarizing all the watch lists</a> for this season. Which nicely highlights OSU’s challenge this year – compared to years past, OSU has way too few players on these lists. For OSU to achieve the top 5-10 finish predicted by a lot of pollsters, some relative unknowns are going to have to have breakout seasons. OSU certainly has the talent but will it develop and gel?</p>
