<p><a href="http://www.fotopedia.com/en/Cougar_Mountain">Cougar Mountain photos on Fotopedia - The Photo Encyclopedia</a> â€“ OK this is my first whack at this. I am not certain where Fotopedia will fit in my current suite of photo production and management tools (Canon Digital Photo Pro, Aperture, occasional Photoshop, Smugmug), but it is a great site and a veyr nice piece of client software. The integration with Aperture is nice. Hats off to the Fotopedia team (we are an investor).</p>
