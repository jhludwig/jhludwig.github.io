<p>Had a great father’s day, got some cool photo tools, some books that look great, and a couple of games since I have played Left4Dead and Fallout3 to death. Here’s some stuff I didn’t get and probably for good reason.</p>

<p>Physical Stuff:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://fountaincan.com/index.html">Faux fountains</a> via <a href="http://www.sjl.us/main/2009/06/a-floating-faucet-fountain.html">Scott Loftesness</a>. Cool looking and an inspiration for Halloween. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/06/ip-pbx-for-dummies/">IP PBX tips for home</a>. I was all excited about this several years ago but increasingly not so…having resident phone technology seems so backwards * <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2009/06/new_projects_wa.php">Projects Watches wristwatches</a>. Cool looking but increasingly I have given up on wristwatches. * <a href="http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20090111/the-home-security-television-simulator/">Television emulator.</a> I don’t know, I think the dogs would prefer to watch real TV. * <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/the_evolution_of_camera_forms_part_1_then_and_now_13795.asp">Olympus PEN</a>. Having just hauled the Canon up and down a mountain Sunday morning, the idea of a smaller form factor camera with great lenses is appealing. * <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/03/denon-avp-aqhd/">Super Duper Denon pre-amp</a>. Just can’t face all the cabling problems tho of disconnecting my current and connecting in a new.</p>

<p>Virtual Stuff: * <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a>. Like the idea of automated analysis of my financials, but I am just not going to give another party access to all my financial credentials. They should license these tools to financial service firms for use on their own websites. * <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348279,00.asp?kc=PCRSS02129TX1K0000530">Cisco Network Magic</a>. Nice review. Congrats to the former Pure Networks team. * <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/10259">Filemaker Bento iPhone app</a>. I regularly get sucked into thinking I need a database and this app is sucking me in again. I know tho I will enter 7 records and abandon the damn thing so I am holding off.</p>
