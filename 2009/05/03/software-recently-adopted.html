<p>* <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/">Tweetdeck</a>. Duh. * <a href="http://www.elliecomputing.com/Products/merge_overview.asp">ECMerge</a>. I complained to Scooter Software about the lack of a mac version of <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">BeyondCompare</a>, they kindly suggested ECMerge or <a href="http://www.araxis.com/merge_mac/index.html">Araxis Merge</a>. Araxis is way too expensive. ECMerge is solid but I still pine for BeyondCompare. * <a href="http://www.roxio.com/enu/products/toast/titanium/overview.html">Toast Titanium</a>. I want a way to watch my Tivo shows on my mac and Toast seems to be the way to go. Seems to work well. * <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">MATLAB</a>. I’m a sucker for math software. Only reasonable if you are an active student or your employer buys it for you. * <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>. Another duh. THE way to watch wmvs on a mac (and UW lectures are all delivered in wmv format).</p>

<p>Oh and on the PC I am so in love with <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>. I don’t even think about CD-based games anymore. Why isn’t all Windows software delivered this way? Why hasn’t Microsoft purchased Valve?</p>
