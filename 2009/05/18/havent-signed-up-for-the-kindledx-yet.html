<p><a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/official_launch_of_the_kindle_dx_13396.asp">Official launch of the Kindle DX - Core77</a>. I bought the Kindle and Kindle2 the instant I could. I am holding off on the DX.  Why?</p>

<p>* It is not clear to me that it enhances recreational reading at all – and in fact the size makes it less convenient</p>

<p>* The cost savings on textbooks aren’t large enough for me to get excited yet</p>

<p>* And more importantly the usage model of a textbook is different than that of a recreational book. Lots of flipping to sections, flipping back and forth, index usage, marking places, etc – does the device make this better?</p>

<p>* Can I use it in an open book exam setting?</p>

<p>So I am not sure yet. Eventually the weight savings may compel me but I am not there yet.</p>
