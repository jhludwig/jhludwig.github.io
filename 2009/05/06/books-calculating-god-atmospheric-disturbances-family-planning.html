<p>* “Calculating God”:amazon by Robert Sawyer. Fine first contact tale with a lot of pathos. Amazon says 4 stars, it is a solid effort. * “Atmospheric Disturbances”:amazon by Rivka Galchen. Tale of a psychotic man trying to make sense of his life. Oddly engaging, you want him to succeed. Amazon says 3 stars but very bimodal, you either love or hate this book. * “Family Planning”:amazon by Karan Mahajan. Tale of maturation of eldest son and father in a huge family. Tends towards farce at times which I did not enjoy, but the core relationship stories are good. 5 stars on Amazon, that may be a bit rich, but a good book.</p>
