      <td>Design Milk](http://design-milk.com/lamp-with-pigtails/). Seems vaguely creepy, a bunch of these with dimmers in the living room for a halloween party would be eerie. * Love these <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2009/05/leucos_usa_at_e.php">egg lights too</a>. Fully lit they are kind of cheery. Put a dim pulsing bulb in there and it feels like the lower deck of some alien spaceship wreckage.</td>
