<p>I didn’t note this yesterday tho many did – 2000+ days since OSU has last lost to UM, as <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/buckeyextra/dispatch-stories/osufootball.html">the counter on the Dispatch page constantly advises</a>. Still haven’t fully recovered from the shame of the Cooper years but an excellent start. Though the rivalry needs a little more drama if it is to remain the top rivalry in sports.</p>
