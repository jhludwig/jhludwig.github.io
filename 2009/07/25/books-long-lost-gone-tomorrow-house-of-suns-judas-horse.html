<p>* “Long Lost”:amazon by Harlan Coben. Coben takes his Bolitar character into dark and personal territory. As always a fun adventure. Bolitar in Paris is great. Amazon says 3.5 stars, I’d up it to 4. * “Gone Tomorrow”:amazon by Lee Child. Another fine Reacher tale. Tho I start to feel that Reacher needs some depth – the Bolitar character in the Coben is more interesting because of his personal relationships. Reacher could benefit from some commitment – personal or professional. Amazon says 4 stars but I’d drop to 3.5. * “House of Suns”:amazon by Alastair Reynolds. In a far distant future, the galaxy filled by humanity and it’s offspring, a galaxy-threatening crisis. A fairly typical form, some interesting elements, but ultimately somewhat forgettable. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I’d say 3.5. Maybe 3.75. * “Judas Horse”:amazon by April Smith. A nicely layered tale of an FBI agent deep undercover. No one is quite who they seem, no one is a pure hero or villian. The agent’s struggles to maintain her own identity are nicely handled. Amazon says 4.5 stars, this is clearly the star of this crop of books.</p>
