<p><a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/07/soon-no-more-random-apple-connectors/">Rich points out</a> that we may have some progress on using micro-usb as a universal device connector. That would be awesome. I carry the most disastrous bag of wallwarts and cables now to keep everything going.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a <a href="http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer/hdmi_1_4/micro_connector.aspx">new connector type for HDMI</a> is coming. Sigh. The A/V connector/cable world remains a disaster.</p>

<p>Many good refs on the net for cable and connector types. Just discovered <a href="http://www.hardwarebook.info/">Hardware Book</a> for instance.</p>
