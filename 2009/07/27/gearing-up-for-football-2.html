<p><a href="http://cfn.scout.com/2/882151.html">CFN’s Big Ten Preview is up</a>. OSU gets the requisite amount of love. Though OSU needs some defensive players to surprise to achieve the promise of the team.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/072709aaa.html">OSU picked to finish first</a> at Media Day.</p>

<p>Here are my hopes for the season: * OSU of course defeats SC and goes on to win the Big10 * Michigan takes steps towards respectability. You can’t have the best rivalry in sports if one of the programs sucks. * Someone rises in the west to challenge USC. * UW gets up off the mat and makes some progress. * Florida and Tebow take a dive. I am so sick of the Tebow-gasm in the press every day. My 2nd favorite team every weekend will be whoever is playing Florida.</p>
