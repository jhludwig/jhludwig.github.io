Obviously some of us do – myself, <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com">Rich</a>. We do it for personal reasons, not motivated by our business – we’d be blogging if we were still at MSFT, if we were running a vinyard, etc. As such, our blogs reflect 85% our personal interests and a little bit of business interest.</p>

<p>John asserts that “…there’s opportunity for a VC in town to explain what is really going on in the venture industry in clear and concise terms with no BS…” However, this is not our business. Our business is investing, and to motivate a VC-focused blog, you’d have to be convinced that such a blog would a) improve your deal flow, or b) improve your exits. Not obvious to me at all.</p>

<p>Additionally you’d have to be certain you could sustain the blog – the examples of abandoned blogs that John mentions seems to be a bad outcome.</p>
