<p>Hate the feel of softened water. Didn’t really understand the chemistry of water softening until I poked around a little tonight – <a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/question99.htm">how does a water softener work</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_softener">wikipedia topic</a> – apparently water softeners replace the Ca and Mg ions with Na which is less damaging to pipes, etc. But it still makes the water feel slippery. I’d like something that removes the Ca and Mg and leaves nothing behind. A lot of systems claim to do this, some below:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.lifesourcewater.com/physical_conditioning.html" title="Water Softener - Water Filter - Water Softners">Water Softener - Water Filter - Water Softners</a> * <a href="http://www.advancedwaterfilters.com/">Advanced Water Filters</a> * <a href="http://clearwatergmx.com/">GMX</a> -- this looks way too low capacity * The <a href="http://www.aquaferwater.com/AWS12.html">Aquafer</a> * The <a href="http://www.scaleblaster.com/">ScaleBlaster</a>. Also probably too low capacity but I love the name.</p>

<p>I wonder if any of these work. And are cost effective.</p>
