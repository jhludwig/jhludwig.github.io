<p>Stumbled across this story recently, I always loved it – <a href="http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html" title="meat.rtf">meat.rtf</a> – “You know how when you slap or flap meat, it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat.”</p>
