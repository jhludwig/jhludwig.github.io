<p>And sloppy basketball at that. <a href="http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/gamecenter/teamstats/NCAAF_20070906_MITNST@LOU" title="NCAA Football Team Stats - CBSSports.com">NCAA Football Team Stats - CBSSports.com</a> – almost 1300 yards of offense between the teams. and 5 fumbles, 2 ints in the game. 28 penalties and 328 penalty yards. Sloppy! I can’t believe in Louisville as a top 10 team with this kind of play.</p>
