<p>I don’t know what R-67 is, but I’ve seen this group – <a href="http://www.reject67.org/" title="Reject R-67">Consumers Against Higher Insurance Rates</a> – running numerous inflammatory ads against it. Google reveals that one of these “consumers” is <a href="http://www.pdc.wa.gov/rptimg/Default.aspx?docid=1044692">State Farm</a>, who has given $284K to the campaign. Another is <a href="http://www.insurancenewsnet.com/article.asp?a=top_news&amp;id=84581">Professional Insurance Agents of Washington</a>. Here’s <a href="http://www.reject67.org/who.html">the whole list</a> – note that it is free for individuals to join, and they have a damn small list. And I wonder how many of these are employees/members of the insurance industry companies/groups?</p>

<p>The duplicity of this campaign pretty much convinces me to vote for R-67, whatever it is.</p>

<p>UPDATE: OK I don’t know why this ticks me off so much, something about these monied interests wrapping themselves in the cloak of consumerism.

The group founders are not consumers but come from <a href="http://www.walrc.org/about/board-members.html">this tort reform group</a>. Here’s some <a href="http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/davidpostman/archives/2007/06/25/">Seattle news coverage</a> about the media buying from earlier this summer.</p>
