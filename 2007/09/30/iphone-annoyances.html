<p>* I really need this – <a href="http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_iphone.php/" title="The Missing Sync for iPhone - Synchronize Mac OS X and iPhone">The Missing Sync for iPhone - Synchronize Mac OS X and iPhone</a> – it is a bummer notes on the iphone don’t sync with anything useful * the new itunes store network connection in starbucks is a terrible implementation. Since i am not a paid user of the tmobile network, when i walk in a starbucks now, the itunes store lights up, but every other website dies because the tmobile connection is limited to the itunes store. this is terrible, i can’t sit in a starbucks now and just browse the web, unless i go futz with network settings. really stupid. drives me out of the starbucks store. * lack of select/copy/paste functionality in text fields is terrible * really needs a todo list app</p>
