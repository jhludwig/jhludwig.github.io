<p><a href="http://crunchgear.com/2007/02/13/milk-desk/" title="Milk Desk">Milk Desk</a> – i love well designed office furniture. I have a custom desk now that I am unhappy with because, despite massive passthrus, it just can’t handle the cabling and desk space demands of all the accesories needed. I am designing my own desk right now, some cool ideas in this one.</p>
