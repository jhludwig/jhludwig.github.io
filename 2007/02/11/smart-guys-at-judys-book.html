Great pithy maxim. Doesn’t apply so well to heart surgery or parachuting, but really valuable for domains in which the cost of and individual failure is relatively low. * And <a href="http://www.naffziger.net/blog/2007/02/05/when-you-understand-a-market-opportunity-is-everywhere/">Dave says</a> “When you understand a market, opportunity is everywhere”. Again so true in so many domains – deep understanding yields insights.</p>
