<p>One thing I have plenty of is fog. Between my whole yard fog system and my 4-5 point fog systems, i have fog galore.</p>

<p>This year I’d like to do a little more with fog and lighting. <a href="http://www.gotfog.com/vortex1-1.html" title="Fog Machines - Your Guide to using Fog Machines for Halloween">Fog Machine Vortex</a> is one idea i may try. Another I am working on is to project a ghostly image onto a dense area of fog – kind of like <a href="http://www.fogscreen.com">fogscreen</a> but way cheaper.</p>
