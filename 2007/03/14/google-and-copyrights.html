If I am the owner of say the “Ford Mustang” copyright, or “The Who” copyright, or the “Nike” copyright, why do I let Google profit off the search results for these terms? Shouldn’t I demand complete control over the results page and any revenues associated with it? If it was my copyright and I had worked hard to market it, I don’t think I’d understand why Google was allowed to make money off of it.</p>
