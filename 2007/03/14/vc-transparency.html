<p>Via <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/14/reckoning-day-for-venture-capitalists/" title="Reckoning Day For Venture Capitalists?">Techcrunch</a>, <a href="http://www.thefunded.com/">TheFunded</a> which tracks feedback on VCs by funded companies. This s awesome, more transparency and communication is always good. I note <a href="http://www.bvp.com/">Bessemer</a> is rated highly, Iâ€™m on <a href="http://www.networkmagic.com">a board</a> with some Bessemer folks and I would have to agree, they are great. I hope all the Ignition portfolio companies rate us, and rate us honestly.</p>
