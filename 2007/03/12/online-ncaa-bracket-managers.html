<p>I’m in like 10 different pools, my view on various pool managers:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://hoops.pickspal.com/Members/Results.aspx" title="PicksPal Bracket 2007 - NCAA Tournament - March Madness">PicksPal Bracket 2007 - NCAA Tournament - March Madness</a> – easy to enter, a lot of ad content but not annoyingly so. Entire bracket on one page which is nice. * <a href="http://mayhem.sportsline.com/splash/mayhem/spln/opm">Sportsline</a>. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that they show you consensus pick info dynamically as you pick teams – this is freaking awesome. OK the math is sometimes bizarrely wrong but still. My favorite. * <a href="http://tournament.fantasysports.yahoo.com/men">Yahoo</a>. A fine choice. Not fancy but works well. * <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/tcmen/frontpage">ESPN</a>. The worst. Abusive ad content – in tooltips popups, in between regions as you fill in your bracket. I won’t bother to fill in anymore at this site and i would certainly never host one here.</p>
