<p>Trying to figure out what course to take this fall…</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/ee.html#ee500" title="ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING">EE graduate seminar on energy</a> – not sure what typical content would be, but could be relevant to investing side of my life * <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/ee.html#ee553">Power Systems Economics</a> – also could be relevant to investing side * <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/mse.html#mse502">MatSci 502 – Sol Gel processing</a> – just because i like materials science * <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/mse.html#mse510">MatSci 510 – Binding and Structure</a>. Also just because I like materials science, but the “rigorous” in the description is a little scary * <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/mse.html#mse520">MatSci graduate seminar</a> – could be an interesting overview of topics * <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/mse.html#mse555">Matsci 555 – biomimetics</a> – a very interesting topic area * <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/bioeng.html#bioen518">Nanotech seminar</a> – another interesting overview * <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/bioeng.html#bioen599">Bioengineering 599E – biosensors</a> – could be an interesting domain to learn more about</p>
