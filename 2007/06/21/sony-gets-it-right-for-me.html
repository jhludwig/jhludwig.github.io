<p>My <a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/" title="Sony - Reader">Sony - Reader</a> broke, <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2007/06/customer_servic.html">Brad Feld has documented my support experience</a>. Thankfully Sony was responsive and finally got it right, I have a brand new reader now and can get back to using it. I really like the device, and hopefully Sony will get the whole purchase and support solution right for everyone.</p>
