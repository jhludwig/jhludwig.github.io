<p>I’m not really a car guy, but need new tires and wanted good ones. J turned me onto <a href="http://www.tirerack.com/" title="The Tire Rack - Your performance experts for tires and wheels">Tire Rack</a> – they do an awesome job of summarizing all the choices for your car model, including review and real usage data for the tires. Painless ordering.</p>
