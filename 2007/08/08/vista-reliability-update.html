<p>Installed this – <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=938194" title="An update is available that improves the compatibility and reliability of Windows Vista">An update is available that improves the compatibility and reliability of Windows Vista</a> – as I was suffering from several of the named problems:</p>

<p>• The computer stops responding, and you receive a “Display driver stopped responding and has recovered” error message. You can restart the computer only by pressing the computer’s power button. • The computer stops responding or restarts unexpectedly when you play video games or perform desktop operations. • There are stability issues with some graphics processing units (GPUs). These issues could cause GPUs to stop responding (hang). • Visual appearance issues occur when you play graphics-intensive games.</p>

<p>My machine didn’t croak on install. So far, so good</p>
