<p>Been tough to keep up with my coursework at UW this year – they just don’t have a deep distance learning curriculum, particularly in materials science, my interest area. Scanning the web for new options:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.distancelearning.ufl.edu/program.aspx?p=29" title="Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering">Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering</a> – Florida seems to have a prominent program but sigh, the gators. * <a href="http://eng.auburn.edu/distance-learning/gop/programs/materials.html">Auburn</a> as well * <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ProEd/credit/msie">Purdue</a> * <a href="http://distance.tamu.edu/futureaggies/distance-degrees/industrial-engineering.html">Texas A&amp;M</a></p>

<p>Of course if I want to go self-paced and just learn material without worrying about a degree there is always <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Materials-Science-and-Engineering/index.htm">MIT Open Courseware</a> though at a graduate level the materials are often very thin – someones lecture notes.</p>
