<p>Wow. Haven’t installed XP in quite a while. I installed the retail XP from a CD.</p>

<p>Then had to find my motherboard drivers on a different PC, burn them to a CD, since XP didn’t have the drivers on the retail disk. And the motherboard network chipset wouldn’t work until I got the new motherboard drivers.</p>

<p>Then I went to Windows Update. First I had to download and install a new Windows Update component. Then 16 security/critical patches. Then and only then was I allowed to download Service Pack 2, which takes a long time.</p>

<p>And after that reboot, another 85! patches waiting for me. And then I had to download sound card drivers, and nvidia drivers.</p>

<p>So … if you do this, be prepared for a lot of time spent babysitting downloads and installs.</p>
