<p>Another great Halloween. Hundreds and hundreds of visitors. Awesome weather.</p>

<p>A few notes for myself:</p>

<p>* Pneumatics failed. Compressed died. Why? I donâ€™t think it was just an untimely compressor failure. I think there was some overload condition created by my load. * I placed one skeleton over a blue yard uplight just randomly. It looked awesome! I should uplight all skeletons in blue next year. * More i-zombie lightning controllers! Lightning is always popular * More fcgs! I have a couple windows that would be great. Also Kurt recommended illuminating with a moving blacklight on a panning fan base.</p>
