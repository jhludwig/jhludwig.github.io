<p>Latest BCS standings – <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/id/7385660_37_1.pdf" title="7385660_37_1.pdf (application/pdf Object)">7385660_37_1.pdf (application/pdf Object)</a> – the voters are pretty much behind the Buckeyes. The computer polls are a little squirrelly – I’ll accept LSU ahead of OSU in computer polls, they have played some quality teams.</p>

<p>And maybe I can take BC, though this is debatable. Nonconf foes were Army, Mass, BGSU, and ND? Inconference was Wake, NC State, GT, VT. Is this really materially better than OSU’s record?</p>

<p>But Kansas? Who played Central Michigan, SE Louisiana, Toledo, Florida Intl nonconference? and K State, Baylor, Colorado and Texas A&amp;M in conference, with narrow wins over most of those? Does Sagarin factor in the coach’s weight?</p>
