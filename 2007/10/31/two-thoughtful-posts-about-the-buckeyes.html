<p>From last week. Over at SMQ: <a href="http://www.sundaymorningqb.com/story/2007/10/24/173732/75" title="Sunday Morning Quarterback :: MEET YOUR FRONTRUNNER: OHIO STATE">Sunday Morning Quarterback :: MEET YOUR FRONTRUNNER: OHIO STATE</a> – a nice analysis of the Buckeyes. Warms the heart.</p>

<p>And at <a href="http://www.buckeyecommentary.com/files/a-lot-on-the-line.html#unique-entry-id-840">Buckeye Commentary</a>, an analysis I hadn’t seen of OSU’s historical failures against SEC teams. The record is not good. A hypothesis is that OSU has generally been playing against higher rated opponents in bowls as OSU fans travel well. Some reasonable data. Doesn’t explain the debacle in the desert last year tho.</p>
