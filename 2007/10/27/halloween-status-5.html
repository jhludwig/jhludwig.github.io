<p>Dry run last night:</p>

<p>* Foggers in good shape. Large fogger ran fine on about a 12.5% duty cycle, will crank up by Halloween night. 3 point foggers (Cujo’s doghouse, mausoleum, tree) all worked fine. Will need to check fog fluid levels. * Sound systems all operational. Thunder and lightning sounds good, Mausoleum sounds good, Courtyard good, Tree good. Main entrance good. Doghouse levels seem a little off. * lighting all good. Lightning, spots, uv spots all operational. Added LED eyes to skeletons today * major props all functional. active props all working – tree, crate, FCG. Static props all holding together.</p>

<p>Good to go!</p>
