<p>Too late for this year but maybe next – <a href="http://www.ericmaffei.com/">Eric</a> recommends this – <a href="http://www.coolstuffcheap.com/laserwidow.html" title="Laser Widow laser light show is battery powered and lights up the room with a cool home laser light show. - Disco Dj Party Lights   Lasers">Laser Widow laser light show is battery powered and lights up the room with a cool home laser light show. - Disco Dj Party Lights Lasers</a> – his notes: <em>“These projectors usually come with preset or sound-triggered patterns (stars / circles / lissajous, etc.) which they generate by bouncing the beam off of two tiny, rapidly spinning mirrors. I turn the sound activation off, then fiddle with the controls until I get a fixed- or pulsating-diameter oval. I mount the projector about five feet above the ground and aim it down our long driveway. With even a moderate bit of fog I get a great looking oval tunnel that’s at least 50 feet long – as victims approach via the driveway, their heads are right in the middle of the tunnel for quite a distance. (Getting the beam in someone’s eyes is not really a concern since it’s moving so rapidly.) The effect of the fog being “cross-sectioned” by the beam is quite something.”</em></p>
