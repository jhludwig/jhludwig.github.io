When I buy physical disks at SmugMug, those are sunk costs. They’ll never get cheaper because I’ve already paid for them. At Amazon, though, market forces and changes will cause their pricing model to continue to re-adjust downwards. As disks get cheaper, that $0.15/GB/month fee will drop. And instantly all of your storage magically gets cheaper, no sunk costs to worry about.”</em> – seems like the modern version of the MSFT/Intel bet on Moore’s Law. * <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/01/take-time-to-understand-silverlight-its-important/">Everybody seems to love this silverlight thing</a>.
