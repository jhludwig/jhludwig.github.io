<p>I’m really wanting one of these such as the <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details&amp;kw=JVGZHD7&amp;is=REG&amp;Q=&amp;O=productlist&amp;sku=479003" title="JVC GZ-HD7 Everio 60GB Hard Disk Drive HD Camcorder">JVC GZ-HD7 Everio 60GB Hard Disk Drive HD Camcorder</a> – tho the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/technology/03pogue.html?ref=technology">NYTimes review</a> today pee’d all over its image stabilization which seems like a real problem. The other mentioned in the article, the <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=HDRSR7&amp;CategoryName=dcc_DICamcorders_HighDefinitionVideo&amp;DCMP=FROOGLE&amp;HQS=HDRSR7">Sony</a>, saves the video in some goofy format apparently which will create a pain of its own sort. I’ve been using my old camera a lot recently and transferring the video from tape to pc or dvd is such a pain, i am really motivated to move ahead, but not sure either of these cameras is the right jump.</p>
