  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aware-Practice-Presence-Groundbreaking-Meditation-ebook/dp/B077RF7Z6V">Aware</a> by Daniel J. Siegel.  <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/11/recent-books-aware-buddhas-brain-missing-presumed-our-little-secret/buddhasbrain/"><img src="images/BuddhasBrain-300x291.png" alt="" /></a>A recommended text on meditation, but too much handwavey pseudo science for me.  Did not find worthwhile at all, rather found it annoying.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Buddhas-Brain-Practical-Neuroscience-Happiness-ebook/dp/B003TU29WU">Buddha’s Brain</a> by Rick Hanson.  Another text on meditation, way better with much more underpinning and solid practical guidance.  And there is an app!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Missing-Presumed-Novel-Manon-Bradshaw-ebook/dp/B0165I3V06">Missing, Presumed</a> by Susie Steiner.  Excellent start to a detective series, central character is mid-career detective in London with a complex and messy personal life, embroiled in a high profile missing persons case.  Very good.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Our-Little-Secret-Roz-Nay-ebook/dp/B0763TB8W1">Our Little Secret</a> by Roz Nay.  Ooh a dark little tale about obsession, betrayal.  Nicely structured.</li>
