  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Still-Life-Inspector-Gamache-Mystery-ebook/dp/B001OLRMZA">Still Life</a> by Louise Penny.  Great start to this series, homicide in the Quebec countryside.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/02/recent-books-louise-penny-chickenshit-club-black-bolt/glass-houses-cover/"><img src="images/glass-houses-cover-197x300.jpg" alt="" /></a>  I feel like I have read another in this series but can find no evidence of it.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Houses-Novel-Inspector-Gamache-ebook/dp/B01N9ZULCJ">Glass Houses</a> by Louise Penny.  And the latest in her series, also excellent.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chickenshit-Club-Department-Prosecute-Executives-ebook/dp/B06XBZFQR2">The Chickenshit Club</a> by Jesse Eisinger.  The premise is good and there is some interesting detail in here, but the book loses its way in the detail.   I expected to be angry about corporate crime and lack of consequences after reading this book, but I just felt kind of tired.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Bolt-Vol-Hard-Time/dp/1302907328">Black Bolt</a> by Saladin Ahmed.  I dip into graphic novels every once in a while to see what is up.  This one got great reviews.  It was just ok for me, a little difficult to relate to the characters or situation.</li>
