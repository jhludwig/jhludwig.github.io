Deep dive into the British efforts to combat the Nazis with sabotage, resistance, even terrorism. Well done.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/?attachment_id=7744"><img src="images/storied-300x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></li>

J. Fikry</a> by Gabrielle Zevin. I picked this up at random on Independent Bookstore Day at <a href="https://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Bookstore</a>.  Fantastic hopeful book about loss and love.  Great characters.  Very glad I took the chance – what I really like about independent bookstores is their “staff picks” area.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/March-Book-One-John-Lewis-ebook/dp/B00CTBU3NC">March</a> by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, Nate Powell.  Great graphic novel about the life of John Lewis.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amatka-Karin-Tidbeck-ebook/dp/B0716GNTTG">Amatka</a> by Karen Tidbeck.  Another Independent Bookstore Day purchase.  A town whose very existence is defined and controlled by language, and what happens as some of the residents start to rebel against control and language.  A little trippy but I enjoy tales like these.</li>
