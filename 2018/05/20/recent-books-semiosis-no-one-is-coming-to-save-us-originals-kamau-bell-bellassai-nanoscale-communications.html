  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Semiosis-Novel-Sue-Burke-ebook/dp/B071RXVGGB">Semiosis</a> by Sue Burke.  Very good first contact tale, the things we meet might be very very different than us.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/No-One-Coming-Save-Us/dp/0062472984">No One is Coming to Save Us</a> by Stephanie Powell Watts.  Another independent bookstore pick up, waaaay outside my comfort zone, and I just couldn’t get thru it.  <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/05/recent-books-semiosis-no-one-is-coming-to-save-us-originals-kamau-bell-bellassai-nanoscale-communications/bell/"><img src="images/bell-199x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Originals-How-Non-Conformists-Move-World-ebook/dp/B00XIYGCDO">Originals</a> by Adam Grant.  I expected to hate this as I tend not to enjoy pop business books, or books that justify people being jerks.  But it was better than that.  Useful tools for encouraging creativity in yourself and your teams.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Awkward-Thoughts-Kamau-Bell-Heterosexual-ebook/dp/B01LZXZK2F">The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell</a> by W. Kamau Bell. Interesting story of a developing comic and his experiences with racism. I need to watch his show on CNN.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Awful-Observations-Matt-Bellassai-ebook/dp/B071CTJX14">Everything is Awful</a> by Matt Bellassai.  Another book by a comic, and this one is thin gruel after reading Bell above.  Couldn’t finish, seemed so lightweight.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nanoscale-Communication-Networks-Science-Engineering/dp/1608070034">Nanoscale Communication Networks</a> by Stephen F. Bush.  From 2010, so in this field this is like a billion years old,  but still interesting.  Transport mechanisms, delay characteristics, accuracy are so different at the nanoscale.</li>
