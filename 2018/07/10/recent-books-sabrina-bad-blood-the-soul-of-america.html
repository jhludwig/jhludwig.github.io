  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup-ebook/dp/B078VW3VM7">Bad Blood</a> by John Carreyrou. The Theranos story.  Wow. Unalloyed ambition, the worst of Silicon Valley.  Holmes and Balwani are clearly bad actors but their investors and legal partners get off too easily – they created and fed the monster.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soul-America-Battle-Better-Angels-ebook/dp/B079KV32KF">The Soul of America</a> by Jon Meacham.  Division and bigotry has been part of America forever, every generation has struggled with it.  The best of our Presidents have been unifiers and have worked to bring us together – and the country has survived the divisive demagogues, but it will take engagement and action on all our parts.  Excellent perspective.</li>
