  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Have-No-Idea-Universe/dp/0735211515">We Have No Idea</a> by Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson. A walk through the big unanswered questions about our universe. The sophomoric humor is very tiresome, I enjoyed some of the information, but can’t recommend.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/01/recent-books-we-have-no-idea-the-grid-exit-west-adam-and-eve/514kmtxmgl-_sx331_bo1204203200_/"><img src="images/514KmtXMGL._SX331_BO1204203200_-200x300.jpg" alt="" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grid-Fraying-Between-Americans-Energy/dp/1632865688">The Grid</a> by Gretchen Bakke. This book has had a lot of buzz, but it is very tiresome.  Some interesting observations but wrapped up in wooden repetitive prose.  The language and story aren’t good enough to make this book widely popular, and the data is too thin for a really technical book.  I resorted to just reading the topic sentences of paragraphs and trying to make do with that.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exit-West-Novel-Mohsin-Hamid-ebook/dp/B01H17U9OQ">Exit West</a> by Mohsin Hamid.  Nice tale of immigration, especially pertinent today. Our birthplace is a matter of sheer chance, it does not define us.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-Adam-Eve-ebook/dp/B06XH7FFWC">The Rise and Fall of Adam and Eve</a> by Stephen Greenblatt.  A dive into the Adam and Eve story, and how its relevance and meaning have changed over the past several thousand years.  Very helpful context, it would be interesting to read the origin myths of other major religions and a theological discussion of them.</li>
