  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Have-You-Tried-Working-Sport-Hardened-ebook/dp/B07B2CMQM3">Have You Tried Working?</a> By Anthony Gardner.  Ugh.  Poorly written, and then his flippancy about CTE turned me completely off.  Can’t figure out why I bought this.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Darkening-Age-Christian-Destruction-Classical/dp/0544800885">The Darkening Age</a> by Catherine Nixey.  This won’t be popular with some people, a look into how the intolerant early Christian Church destroyed the arts, literature, and science of Western world and contributed to the dark ages.</li>
