  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waking-Up-White-Finding-Myself-ebook/dp/B00HZZ1JD0">Waking Up White</a> by Debby Irving.  <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/10/recent-books-waking-up-white-beyond-the-pale-light-years-koryta-murderbot/wuw/"><img src="images/wuw-200x300.jpg" alt="" /></a>A lot to process in this book.  I am probably just a few steps along the path to really understanding race in the US and my own role in the issues.  This is definitely worth reading and thinking about.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Pale-World-Spies-Mystery-ebook/dp/B075W2V7GP">Beyond the Pale</a> by Clare O’Donahue.  Pleasant little detective jaunt set mostly in Ireland.  An appealing couple of main characters.  The MacGuffin is a little forced, but the chase for it has some fun parts.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Light-Years-Vintage-International-Salter-ebook/dp/B004G8PIOA">Light Years</a> by James Salter.  A bit of a throwback, and oh so nicely written – very very smooth.  Makes the above modern texts seem clunky.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Happened-Michael-Koryta-ebook/dp/B075CRZZRC">How It Happened</a> by Michael Koryta.  Solid thriller set in coastal Maine – murders, drugs, tawdry secrets.  Engaging</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Condition-Murderbot-Martha-Wells-ebook/dp/B075DGHHQL">Artificial Condition</a> by Martha Wells.  Gosh this MurderBot series is fun.  I want a wisecracking sidekick murderous robot.</li>
