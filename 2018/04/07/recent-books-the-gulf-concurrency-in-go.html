  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gulf-Making-American-Sea/dp/1631494023">The Gulf</a> by Jack E. Davis.  <a href="http://theludwigs.com/2018/04/recent-books-the-gulf-concurrency-in-go/gulf/"><img src="images/gulf-209x300.jpg" alt="" /></a>A history of the development of the Gulf of Mexico over the last 300 years sounds like it could be dull, but it is actually pretty interesting, though there is a ton of detail in here.  Enjoying it – if I ever planned to the move to the Gulf Coast, this would be essential.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Concurrency-Go-Tools-Techniques-Developers/dp/1491941197">Concurrency in Go</a> by Katherine Cox-Buday.  Ok this is the far more essential book to read about Go, the intro to Go book I previously read should have had all this material.  This is the interesting stuff.</li>
