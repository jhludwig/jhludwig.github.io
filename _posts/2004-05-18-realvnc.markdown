As an alternative to [Rdesktop and WinXP's remote desktop](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001462.html "a little ludwig goes a long way: Fun with Rdesktop") I tried out [RealVNC](http://www.realvnc.com). Oh my gosh the performance was baaaad between two XP machines. Latency, and really bad glitchy repaint. Hard to recommend this. I'd stick with XP's facility for XP to XP connections (tho this kind of requires XP Pro for most general use) and rdesktop for \*nix machines.
