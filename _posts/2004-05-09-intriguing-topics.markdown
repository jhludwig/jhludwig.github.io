Various posts that I found compelling:

\* [Evan WIlliams](http://www.evhead.com/archives/2004_05_01_archive.asp#108361672529033654) found this anecdote: "A 14-year-old from California, Justin Fong, asked what advice Buffett and Munger would give a young person on how to be successful. 'It's better to hang out with people better than you,' said Buffett. 'Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you'll drift in that direction.' Added Munger drily, 'If this gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group, the hell with 'em.'" \* Seb has a [list of visionaries](http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2004/05/03.html#a1562 ) he likes to follow \* Tyler Cowen on [subjective time](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/05/subjective_time.html) -- wow, 70+% of my life is over as subjectively perceived. \* Over at [gadgetopia](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/05/05/PHPAndMath.html), a pointer to [PHPMath](www.phpmath.com) -- a lot of interesting math implemented in PHP. \* [Acoustic Cryptanalysis](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/)
