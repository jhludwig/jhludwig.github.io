They've [turned their corp website into a blog](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/10/our_web_site_is.html) -- [UnionSquareVentures.com](http://www.unionsquareventures.com/).  We've been talking about doing this for a year but just never got there.  I love their motivation:

> _We realized that our \[investment\] thesis evolves incrementally as a result of our dialogue with the market, and that the best way to manage that was to accept that we would never get to an answer, so we should just publish the conversation._
