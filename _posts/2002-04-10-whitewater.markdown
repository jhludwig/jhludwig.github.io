**Whitewater**. Time to book those summer trips now. [North Cascades River Expeditions](http://www.riverexpeditions.com/) and [River Riders](http://www.riverrider.com/index.html) have worked for us in the past. The Tieton and Wenatchee runs were the most fun. The Nooksack and Suiattle are beautiful but can be a bit cold and damp.
