[Shrek2](http://www.shrek2.com/). Entertaining but not as good as the first one. The minor characters drawn from fairy tales are hilarious -- puss n boots, pinocchio. But too much screen time for the king and fairy godmother, who just aren't that funny.

[Troy](http://troymovie.warnerbros.com/). Hector the role, and Eric Bana as Hector were great. But somehow the movie felt fatiguing, I was glad when it was over.

[Day after tomorrow](http://www.thedayaftertomorrow.com/). A blast. So what if the science is probably crap. And the political manipulation ham-handed. Probably due to my [fly-over country upbringing](http://ohio.gov/index.stm), there is just something glorious about seeing LA trashed by tornados and NYC swamped and frozen.
