[Oklahoma, Ohio State ink series for 2016, 2017 : Fanblogs College Football Blog](http://www.fanblogs.com/oklahoma/007432.php "Oklahoma, Ohio State ink series for 2016, 2017 : Fanblogs College Football Blog") -- nice announcement. With this the future now looks like:

2008: @USC 2009: USC 2010: Miami (FL) 2011: @Miami (FL) 2012: Cal 2013: @Cal 2014: VT 2015: @VT 2016: @Oklahoma 2017: Oklahoma

Exciting games. Wish we could dump the 12th game or replace it with another quality opponent.
