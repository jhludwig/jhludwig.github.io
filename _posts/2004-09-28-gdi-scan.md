Here is a good tool to check for gdiplus vulnerabilities -- [SANS - Internet Storm Center - Cooperative Cyber Threat Monitor And Alert System - Current Infosec News and Analysis](http://isc.sans.org/gdiscan.php "SANS - Internet Storm Center - Cooperative Cyber Threat Monitor And Alert System - Current Infosec News and Analysis") -- much better than the "be vaguely afraid but we won't tell you why" microsoft tool.
