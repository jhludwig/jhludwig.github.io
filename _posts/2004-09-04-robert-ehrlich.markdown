Read a pair of his -- [Nine Crazy Ideas in Science: A Few Might Even Be True](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0691070016/qid=1094311536/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/104-9987463-4257565?v=glance&s=books "Amazon.com: Books: Nine Crazy Ideas in Science: A Few Might Even Be True.") and [8 Preposterous Prepositions](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0691099995/ref=pd_sim_books_1/104-9987463-4257565?v=glance&s=books). There were some interesting articles -- the one on the abiogenic origin of oil/gas/coal was interesting and obviously very relevant to our lives. But a lot of it just didn't grab me.
