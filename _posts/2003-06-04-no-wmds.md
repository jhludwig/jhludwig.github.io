Everyone seems upset that we've found no WMDs -- for instance -- [Philip Greenspun](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/06/04#a461 "Philip Greenspun's Weblog:") points to some UK news.

Seems to me our government set too tight a definition for WMDs. Didn't September 11 demonstrate that the worst WMDs by far are people and organizations of people? With trivial technology, just people can cause all kinds of harm.

If I was in charge of the case for the war, I would have included people and organizations within the definitions of WMDs; particularly people and organizations that foment and export hatred of our culture/society (or really any culture/society, as it is the hatred and the actions that hatred bring on that we want to target).

But then, no one asked me.
