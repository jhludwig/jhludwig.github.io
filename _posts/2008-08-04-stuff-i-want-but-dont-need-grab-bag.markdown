- [Yamaha Muro Sensor](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2008/07/yamaha_muro_sensor.html).  Love funky musical instruments.  These are kind of a 21st century bell choir.
- [Estes Hydrogen Fuel Rocket](http://www.tongfamily.com/2008/07/estes-hydrogen-fuel-rocket/).  Love model rockets, used to spend way too much time with them.  Almost blew up the garage once (oops Dad, I never told you about that did I?)  Thanks [rich](http://www.theludwigs.com/go/rich/)
- [Utilikey](http://www.amazon.com/Swiss-Tech-UKCSB-Ulti-Keyring/dp/B0001EFSTI/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=automotive&qid=1216737713&sr=8-1).  I always have my key chain with me, love the idea of adding utility to it
- [Atmos clock](http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2008/07/jaeger_lecoultr.php) -- runs for years powered by tempereature changes
