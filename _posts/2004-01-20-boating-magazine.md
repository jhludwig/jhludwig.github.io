My [3rd magazine of 52 this year](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001279.html). [Boating](www.boatingmag.com) is the largest circulation boating mag in the US -- nearly [250,000 paid copies a month](http://www.hfmmag.com/HachetteUSA/Page.asp?Site=Boating&Page=Circulation), predominantly male, median age 46, middle class. While I don't normally read this mag, I have at times been a boating nut -- I had my first motorboat when I was 7 years old, I had my first boating accident when I was 7 years and 2 days old.

Stream of consciousness: 369 boaters killed in 2001, usually people in the middle of the experience curve with 3-5 years boating 50 hrs a year (hey this is way more dangerous than mad cow, why aren't we destroying boats?)...advertisement for the [boston whaler](www.whaler.com) -- my teen years boat, what a great boat...some dude spent [12 days in a diving suit](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3176730.stm) walking the bottom of loch ness, impressive...[Schaefer](http://www.pabst.com/flashsite/ourbeer.htm#) is rated the best cheap beer for a long day in the sun...no surprise here, you can get great deals on marine electronics on ebay...Anchor effectiveness is a function of fluke area, not weight..[tilefish](http://www.mycustompak.com/healthNotes/Food_Guide/Tilefish.htm) is the hot new dish, tastes like lobster...the [Multi-Agency Craft Conference](http://www.boats.dt.navy.mil/MACC/) sounds way cool, the military boat show: Outboards that run on any fuel (even whiskey) -- completely submersible outboard engines for SEAL missions -- electrical supply from outboards for boat electronics -- bulletproof inflatable RIB boats -- shock absorbing decking and seating for human cargo -- roostertail-free designs for reduced radar signatures...

Overall a good read. A large variety of boating info, product reviews, color articles, etc.
