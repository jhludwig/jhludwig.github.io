\* [Kiko](http://www.kiko.com) -- an ajax calendar. looks nice. [Walt reviewed two others today](http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/solution-20050831.html) -- it's an explosion of web calendars, it's 1998 all over again. Not sure I understand why people will migrate to this new generation. I guess people are more trained to use web services now, and in broadband households, it is easy to always have the calendar live. \* Via [furrygoat](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/08/no_install.html), [No-install.com](http://No-install.com) -- apps that you can put on usb keys. \* [Monad and WMI](http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/08/monad_and_wmi.html) -- cool. \* [Greasemonkeyed.com](http://Greasemonkeyed.com) has like a jillion greasemonkey scripts to install. Playing around with book burro at the moment. \* I am easily bought -- I use [a9.com](http://www.a9.com) frequently now. Not because it is great, but because i get another pi/2 percent discount on my amazon purchases. Same reason i got an Amazon Visa card. \* Via [cpumag](http://www.cpumag.com) I found [Free-codecs.com](http://www.Free-codecs.com) and the K-lite mega codec pak -- every freakin' codec you could ever want. [Videozilla](www.videozilla.net) looks interesting in this vein as well. \* I should try [viceversa](http://www.tgrmn.com/) to manage backups in the house. \* I'm tempted to renew my MSDN sub so that I can get [winfs beta](http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/29/2241243&from=rss) -- because who needs a stable filesystem? \* Via [geekman](http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Netcool.html) I found [myprogs](http://www.myprogs.net). Given my appetite for software, a community ranking site for software seems great. \* also given all the software i install, why doesn't windows have something as nice as ppm in perl for downloading addons/packages/etc? ppm is so easy. \* [Movable type style generator](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Movalog?m=83 ) seems cool \* JK on the run talks about something that i thought was just me -- the [impossiblity of doing system restores for tablet pcs](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/08/open_letter_to_.html) . I have a tablet pc collecting dust for exactly this reason -- after struggling through 2 system restores i gave up.
