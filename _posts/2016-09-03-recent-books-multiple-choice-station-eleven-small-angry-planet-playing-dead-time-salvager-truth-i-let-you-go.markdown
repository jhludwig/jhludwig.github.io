- [Multiple Choice](https://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Choice-Alejandro-Zambra/dp/0143109197) by Alejandro Zambra. From the text -- "You read books that are much stranger than the books you would write if you wrote." -- and that about sums it up. This is not for everyone, but I happen to like books that play with the structure of books. But don't blame me if you buy it and say "WTF is this? Why would anyone read such a thing or write such a thing?"
- [Station Eleven](https://www.amazon.com/Station-Eleven-Emily-John-Mandel/dp/0804172447) by Emily St. John Mandel. [![truth-and-other-lies](images/truth-and-other-lies-200x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/09/recent-books-multiple-choice-station-eleven-small-angry-planet-playing-dead-time-salvager-truth-i-let-you-go/truth-and-other-lies/)Solid post-apocalyptic novel with better characters than typical for the genre.
- [The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Small-Angry-Planet-Wayfarers-ebook/dp/B00ZP64F28) by Becky Chambers. A motley crew of space travelers slowly come to realize what family really means. Pleasant.
- [Playing Dead: A Journal Through the World of Death Fraud](https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Dead-Journey-Through-World-ebook/dp/B0176M3ZP6) by Elizabeth Greenwood. Don't do it, the insurers will get you every time.
- [Time Salvager](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Salvager-Wesley-Chu-ebook/dp/B00NKB9RSW) by Wesley Chu. Eh, pretty forgettable space opera.
- [The Truth and Other Lies](https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Other-Lies-Novel-ebook/dp/B00P42WU0C) by Sascha Arango. Nice little tale of psychopaths, murder, plots.
- [I Let You Go](https://www.amazon.com/Let-You-Go-Clare-Mackintosh-ebook/dp/B013D669UC) by Clare Mackintosh. Twisty in a way I did not expect at all. Nice read.
