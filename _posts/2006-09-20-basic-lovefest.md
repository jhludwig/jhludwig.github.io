[Feld Thoughts: Where Has BASIC Gone?](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/001946.html "Feld Thoughts: Where Has BASIC Gone?") -- Feld and commenters participate in the discussion about BASIC.

I've recently come back to BASIC, programming BASIC stamps for Halloween. I have to say, it is quite fun to be able to jump into a program so fast without all the object/ui/typing/etc overhead of "modern" languages or "modern" incarnations of BASIC. totally dangerous of course, but still quite fun. i'd rather be able to use python or something a bit more au courant, but they don't make Python stamps.
