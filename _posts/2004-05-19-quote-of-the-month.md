Currently reading [Musashi](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/4770019572/qid=1084987282/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-7861926-2908857?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) and came across this gem:

_The human mouth is the gateway to catastrophe._

Update: [Zagula finds a gem](http://www.zagula.com/archives/001013.html) as well.
