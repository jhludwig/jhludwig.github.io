I've wondered a little bit about [what the browser should become](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001666.html) -- arguing for a more task/scenario-centric design. Rich has done some interesting thinking too -- [Tong Family Blog: What is Personal Productivity](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/2004/10/06/what_is_personal_productivity.html "Tong Family Blog: What is Personal Productivity") -- a slightly more expansive view on what the personal productivity suite today should look like (since office doesn't really address the common tasks of today). Good stuff rich.
