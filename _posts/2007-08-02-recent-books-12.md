Mostly beach/airport reads:

\* "Gridlinked":amazon by Neal Asher. Galaxy wide suspense romp. Leaves enough unexplained to be interesting. Intriguing alien constructs. Overall a very nice first novel \* "Dead I well may be":amazon by Adrian Mckinty. Wow wow wow. An awesome crime novel. An Irish hoodlum fights his way up the organization and through double crosses. Great great character, I am very motivated to read more. \* "The Architect":amazon by Keith Ablow. Unusual premise and nicely developed villian and investigator. And doesn't wrap up all happy and neatly. \* "Old Man's War":amazon by John Scalzi. Great story in the "Starship Troopers":amazon, "The Forever War":amazon tradition. Characters with depth. \* "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows":amazon by JK Rowling. A fine ending. Perhaps a little too neat. But some good drama. And closure on important items.

and some nonfiction

\* "Fortune's Formula":amazon by William Poundstone. A wander thru the lives of various information theorists, gamblers, economists, and investors, examining the development of ideas about betting systems. Interesting to hear the backstory on Claude Shannon and others, but probably not the most thorough treatment. \* "An Imaginary Tale: The Story of 'i'":amazon by Paul Nahin. Not sure what book on number theory to take to the beach this summer? Well this is an entertaining epistle on the development of the math of imaginary numbers. A mix of history and number theory, at times way too much number theory, but I enjoyed some of the history of the math. What is so interesting is how the world view of scientists was so shaped by their ability to comprehend negative numbers and 'i', and how embracing these concepts allowed them to move dramatically ahead in some many areas. You have to wonder what comparable worldviews are limiting our education and thinking today. I suspect that our educational focus on classical algebraic deterministic approaches to science is an error, and someday we will want to completely reshape how we teach science, introducing quanta and uncertainty from the beginning.
