[Journalists Rejoin Relieved Friends, Family in U.S. - washingtonpost.com](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/05/AR2009080501234.html?hpid=topnews) -- it is awesome that these folks have been freed, and it is generally a good thing that we have found a way to talk to North Korea and have a success at something, here's hoping that this event will contribute to calmer relations with the country.

But as a country we have expended a lot of dollars and diplomatic chips to get these folks free. I hope that we present the folks with a big bill for services rendered -- if you go poking around in dangerous places in the world (like [these folks](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/08/04/iran.americans/), who goes hiking in Iraq/Iran for gosh sakes, was that really the only place you could think of to go hiking??), you should not expect that all the other taxpayers in the country are going to carry the cost of rescuing you. Yes we will rescue you, but there will be a reckoning for services rendered.
