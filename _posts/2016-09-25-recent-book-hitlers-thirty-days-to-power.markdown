[Hitler's Thirty Days to Power](https://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Thirty-Days-Power-January/dp/0201328003) by Henry [![30days](images/30days-192x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/09/recent-book-hitlers-thirty-days-to-power/30days/)Ashby Turner Jr. I read this years ago, and was reminded of it recently. A very very good book and perhaps relevant read, the detailed story of Hitler's precipitous rise to power, and how he was enabled by inaction or self-serving actions of the politicians around him. The idea that he would be held in check by more conventional politicians around him was a historically tragic error.

Worth reading. One of my all-time favorite history books. Worth reflecting on.
