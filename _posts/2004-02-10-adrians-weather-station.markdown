Adrian has kicked some serious butt and gotten up a weather station for the Lake Union Crew Club -- [Weather Page](http://www.theludwigs.com/smithsandbox/weather/weather.htm "Weather Page"). He's even created a wap page for the camera -- http://www.theludwigs.com/smithsandbox/weather/test.wml -- my gosh why doesn't every webcam have this? Now I can walk around and look at Lake Union from my phone or bberry. Adrian is one handy guy.
