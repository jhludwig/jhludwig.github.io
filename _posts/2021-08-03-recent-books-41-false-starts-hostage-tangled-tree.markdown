- [Forty-One False Starts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16059462-forty-one-false-starts) by Janet Malcolm. Essays on creative people and their struggles, their failures, the criticism they endured, and observations about criticism itself. Very interesting to observe the immense amount of work and struggle that goes into creative works.
- [Hostage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56628286-hostage) by Clare Mackintosh. A palate cleanser after the above. The first third was slow but then it got fun. A little too neat at the end but still enjoyable.
- [The Tangled Tree](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373639-the-tangled-tree) by David Quammen. A walk thru some of the developments in our understanding of evolution and genetics over the past ~50 years. I enjoyed it but I am not deep in the space.
