Love Gary Turner's idea of a blog as a personal dashboard -- [memoria technica | Personal Dashboard](http://weblog.garyturner.net/archives/001457.html "memoria technica | Personal Dashboard"). Despite what my huge reading audience might think, I basically do my blog for me. It is where I keep interesting pointers to things, things I might need in the future. I wish it was easy to keep track of all my favorite installed software on my blog, so i could easily move it all to the next machine. More importantly all my PIM data so I could access it from anywhere. Or all my current projects and documents.
