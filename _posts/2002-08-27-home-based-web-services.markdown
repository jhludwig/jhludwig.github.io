**Home-based Web Services**. What [Danny O'Brien](http://www.oblomovka.com/entries/2002/08/26#1030345200) said -- I have a ton of computing power and storage at home...it is on the net all the time...why am I going to pay people for simple services like file storage and mail? The problem with my home network is reliability but I have 4 machines at home on the net, can't software bind them together and make them reliable enough for me?
