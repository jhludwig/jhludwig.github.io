I'm doing some research on automotive engineering education for high school and undergrad students. Wonder if anyone has any tips. The things I've found so far:

\* The [SAE student site](http://students.sae.org/) is a fine place to look for information. Competitions, awards, internships -- more college student focused. This [supermileage contes](http://www.sae.org/news/releases/05smfinal.htm)t looks fun. I wonder if there is an opportunity to create some biodiesel version of this project. \* The [SAE website for college selection](http://students.sae.org/chapters/choosecollege.htm) has some good tips about programs. \* [Kettering University](http://www.kettering.edu/) \-- formerly GMI -- a highly regarded school, but Flint is tough duty. OK I haven't been to Flint in 17 years, maybe it has improved. \* Of course [UM](http://www.umich.edu) has all kinds of programs -- [Transportation Research](http://www.umtri.umich.edu/), [ARC](http://arc.engin.umich.edu/) -- but you have to cheer for the Wolverines and there are some lines I just can't cross. OK full disclosure -- I spent my freshman year in college at UM, I was a traitor to the state of Ohio, but I finally saw the light. \* Down in NASCAR country, [Clemson](http://www.ces.clemson.edu/me/research/index.htm) has a program. There must be other NASCAR state schools that have programs? \* [Colorado State](http://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/) from the SAE site is supposed to have a program of some sort. \* The [art center college of design](http://www.artcenter.edu/) in Pasadena has a program, more focused on aesthetics.
