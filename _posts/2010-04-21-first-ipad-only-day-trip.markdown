Ok took my first day trip today to San Jose with no laptop -- iPad only. I can't imagine ever taking a laptop on a day trip again. Massive reduction in bag weight, no need to pull the iPad out of carry on bags at security, good email and web access at airports and job site via free wifi, good rendering of board slide decks. Awaiting return flight and battery still at 63% after moderate use. The only thing I didn't try out is the dongle for attaching to a projector.

My only dissatisfaction is with Numbers which has a pathetic set of spreadsheet features.

But otherwise this thing is a home run. I saw 3 others on the plane.
