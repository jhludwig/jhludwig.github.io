3 machines at work, 7 at home, and I occasionally need a spreadsheet on all of them. Office is too expensive and overkill, OpenOffice is overkill. I need something lightweight. Trying out [Spread32](http://www.byedesign.freeserve.co.uk/) at the moment. A couple other choices at [tinyapps](http://www.tinyapps.org/) as well including [visicalc](http://www.bricklin.com/history/vcexecutable.htm). Actually I'd love a server-based spreadsheet, a self-hosted open source version of [this](http://www.securesheet.com/), so i wouldn't have to install anything or worry about moving my spreadsheet files around with me.
