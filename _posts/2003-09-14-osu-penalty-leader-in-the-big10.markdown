This is at least part of the story for OSU so far -- [ESPN.com - NCF - College Football Statistics](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/statistics?stat=teammisc&group=5&year=2003&sort=penaltyyds "ESPN.com - NCF - College Football Statistics") -- if they don't get a handle on this, they are going to struggle against the top tier of teams in the Big10. 7th nationwide in penalty yards, this just can't go on.
