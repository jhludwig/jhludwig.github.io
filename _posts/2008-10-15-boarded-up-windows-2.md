[MAKE: Blog: DIY Halloween: Boarded up windows](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/10/diy_halloween_boarded_up.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890) -- one way to do this. An old [post of mine](http://theludwigs.com/2004/07/boarded-up-windows/) with some other ideas. I built my own boarded up windows using foam board -- lightweight, easy to hang with a tension rod, leaves no marks.
