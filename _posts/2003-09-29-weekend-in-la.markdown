Spent the weekend in LA. A great place to visit but wow am I glad I live in the Northwest -- the smog, lack of greenery, and congestion are so wearing.  
  
Best things we did in LA: Dinner at [Mako](http://losangeles.restaurantnotes.com/viewtopic.php?t=368 "- MAKO in Beverly Hills is outstanding - The Best Los Angeles Restaurant Guides are your fellow diners!") -- pan-asian cuisine served tapas-style. Great service and fun food. Lodged at the [Four Seasons](http://www.fourseasons.com/losangeles/) -- great service, and a veritable freak show of celebrities, celebrity-wanna-bes, celebrity entourages, and plastic surgery victims.  
  
Worst things we did in LA: Rodeo Drive looks like a war zone, don't bother going until they finish the street work (Christmas? next year?). [Farmer's Market](http://www.farmersmarketla.com/) -- a lousy market with lousy restaurants. Come up to Pike Place Market in Seattle instead. [Duplex](http://www.miramax.com/duplex/) \-- not Ben Stiller's best work. Funny at times but overall pretty weak.
