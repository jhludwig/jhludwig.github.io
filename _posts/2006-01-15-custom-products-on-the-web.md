Love the fact that the web has enabled so much personalized production. Things I've noticed recently:

\* Visa cards with whatever photo you want on them at [AmericaFirst](http://www.americafirst.com/visa/credit/picture_perfect.cfm) \* Custom designed ice cream flavors at [eCreamery](http://www.ecreamery.com/default.asp) \* Get Logos made for your business or whatever at [Logoworks](http://www.logoworks.com) or [GotLogos](http://www.GotLogos.com) \* Custom foam cushions of any shape, with any fabric cover, using a variety of foams, at [Foamorder.com](http://www.foamorder.com/sewing.html). I've actually used this service and it worked great.
