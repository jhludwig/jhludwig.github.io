[michaelw.net I want a keyboard with a built-in flash card reader](http://michaelw.net/Articles/Iwantakeyboardwithabuilt-.html "michaelw.net I want a keyboard with a built-in flash card reader") -- what michael says. I don't want these crammed into my PC. I want them on the desktop. In the KB would be good tho I notice today that my KB is underpowered and has a problem with USB devices that suck power. My Dell monitor has USB ports on it too, this makes huge sense as a monitor has a power connection.
