\* [Literary themes in Saturday's game](http://www.sundaymorningqb.com/story/2006/11/14/172255/62) -- _"Where Ohio State heaves, Michigan hos; where the Wolverines yin, the Buckeyes yang. Where Troy Smith, um, Marcos, LaMarr Woodley Polos."_ \* [How Ohio State Wins](http://www.sundaymorningqb.com/story/2006/11/16/0328/9156) -- _"If - you know, if - OSU can get out into its familiar advantage, perhaps aided by a giveaway, Michigan's odds of avoiding falling into a one-dimensional game are not significantly better than those of Texas or Iowa."_ \* [Theories and Axioms](http://mgoblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/theories-and-axioms.html) -- _"Michigan is not going to run on 80% of its first downs, nor is it going to close up shop with a two-touchdown lead.
