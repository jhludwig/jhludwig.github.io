Read [Jupiter : A Novel](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812579410/qid=1075438968/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-0807987-2027925?v=glance&s=books "Amazon.com: Books: Jupiter : A Novel") at the airport the other day. Quick read. OK hard science fiction. Pretty familiar theme -- humanity in near future discovers alien intelligent lifeform, forced to wrestle with definition of humanity and implications. Normal amount of scifi action and intrigue. An adequate read but forgettable. If you want a deeply interesting treatment of this theme, try [The Sparrow](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449912558/qid=1075439128/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-0807987-2027925) instead.
