[The Death and Life of the Great Lakes](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-Lakes/dp/0393355551) by Dan Egan.  Continuing on my theme of books about bodies of water -- this was much more compelling than [the Gulf book](http://theludwigs.com/2018/04/recent-books-the-gulf-concurrency-in-go/).  Partly because of my familiarity with the Great Lakes, partly because there was a very strong story in this book that was new to me.  I knew about the pollution issues in the Great Lakes before the EPA, but I never new the story of invasive species and the battles that have been happening.  Very interesting.
