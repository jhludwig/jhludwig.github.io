I've yet to move my house over to a full voip install but still collecting lots of interesting links:

\* [Pulver launches Bellster](http://werbach.com/blog/archives/2005/01/pulver_launches.html) -- now driving termination costs for calls to 0. Do I really want people calling out on my analog lines tho? \* [Prototype phone with zigbee integration](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/pantech-curitel/pantech-curitel-shows-off-first-zigbeecapable-phone-027044.php) -- one attempt at dragging the physical systems of the home into the digital age. \* [Skype answering machine](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2004/12/sam_skype_answe.html). I doubt that most people will want to run their answering machine on their pc. The voip answering machine service must emulate the features/availibility of existing answering machines or telco-based answering services -- in both cases, easy access from a handset or multiple handsets in the house. \* [Rich reminds me](http://www.tongfamily.com/2004/12/17/voip_at_home.html) that I don't just want SIP phones in the house, i need PBX functionality so that extensions work like they should -- ie all ring at once on an incoming call. \* [Todd Duffin](http://www.tippyturtle.com) is way ahead of me, he has done a lot. He's had good experiences with the [Sipura SPA-2000](http://www.voipsupply.com/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=14&products_id=33&desc=Sipura%20SPA-2000%20SPA%202000), an [SER server](http://www.iptel.org/ser/), and asterisk for pbx/vm. Lot i have to learn here.
