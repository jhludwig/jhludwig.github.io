Good article this weekend in the nytimes about ultralight camping gear. [GoLite designs, manufactures and sells ultra-lightweight hiking and climbing gear, clothing and equipment.](http://www.golite.com/ "GoLite designs, manufactures and sells ultra-lightweight hiking and climbing gear, clothing and equipment.") [GVP](http://www.gvpgear.com/) is another provider. [BackPackingLight](http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/index.html) is the online mag to read. I'm already hauling around enough extra weight on my body, going really lightweight on gear makes sense.
