\* [Monster Guts](http://monsterguts.com/ "Monster Guts") -- some nice things in here, i need to look at the iogeek product a little more \* [Battery operated candles](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20070220/realistic-battery-operated-candles/) -- these seem a little pricey, i suspect you could buy some of the flicker led products out there and embed them in your own candles for less money. \* [Amazon deep discount links](http://chris.pirillo.com/2007/02/07/amazon-discount-links/) -- nice, i bet there is some good stuff in the 90% off section that might be good for halloween
