\* [Looping skull](http://www.kerlinsoftworks.com/haunt/skull3.zip) \-- not sure what I'd do with but if I have a spare monitor might be worth running at a window. or maybe i should find a cheap projector... \* Free circuit designs at [redcircuits](http://www.redcircuits.com/). Some of these may be useful. \* in the money is no object category, [fog screens](http://www.fogscreen.com/product.html).
