I blog for myself. The site is my annotated bookmarks and my longterm memory. I search it regularly to find that certain halloween prop idea, that book I read, that software I tried. I don't care much about my readership, though I have gotten a lot of value from readers -- software suggestions, reconnects from old friends, business proposals.

I originally intended to use my blog to communicate with family but the lack of simple privacy solutions killed that.
