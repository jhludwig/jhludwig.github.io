**AOL pulls rug from under 'Magic Carpet".** AOL has [disbanded the Magic Carpet](http://www.betanews.com/article.php3?sid=1038832383) team. Is anyone really surprised? The history of industry consortiums that have come together with the sole purpose of countering some Microsoft initiative is not good. I remember viewing these consortiums with amusement because the members were never truly aligned on goals, they just all wanted to join in a Microsoft hate-fest, and that never leads to a viable software product. And it just wastes the time and energy of these companies.
