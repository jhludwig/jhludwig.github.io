[WhoseTube? Viacom Sues Google Over Video Clips - New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/technology/14viacom.html?ei=5088&en=0778206efd843464&ex=1331524800&adxnnl=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1173893970-pHMPmf3O1zYrCOBzdI/VQg "WhoseTube? Viacom Sues Google Over Video Clips - New York Times") -- one has to wonder why this is limited to video material. If I am the owner of say the "Ford Mustang" copyright, or "The Who" copyright, or the "Nike" copyright, why do I let Google profit off the search results for these terms? Shouldn't I demand complete control over the results page and any revenues associated with it? If it was my copyright and I had worked hard to market it, I don't think I'd understand why Google was allowed to make money off of it.
