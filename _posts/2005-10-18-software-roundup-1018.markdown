- Via [furrygoat](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/10/virtualwifi.html), MSFT's [virtual WIFI software](http://research.microsoft.com/netres/projects/virtualwifi/default.htm).  I'm not sure this will actually make my life any better -- now I'll be able to connect to several crappy buggy wifi hotspots at a time instead of just one -- but looks like fun to play with.
- A nice review of [RocketPost](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/10/jkontherun_revi.html).  I am also using and have been very impressed with.  And the dev team has been super supportive.
- [A request to make FrontRow available for legacy Macs](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2005/10/18/stuck_in_the_back_row).  Hear hear.
- [Portforward.com](www.portforward.com).  Pure networks guys take note
