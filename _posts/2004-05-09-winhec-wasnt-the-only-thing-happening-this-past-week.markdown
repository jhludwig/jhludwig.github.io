\* [Knoppix v3.4](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/03/2244203) out. Downloading now via bittorrent. Good article [here](http://www.shockfamily.net/cedric/knoppix/) on using Knoppix in disaster scenarios. \* [Java Desktop System V2](http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_05_02_archive.htm#108370079196609981) out. Somewhat intriguing but I am not willing to shell out $50/year to try it. Sun really needs a cheaper license for personal/educational/developer use. Otherwise everyone is going to be using Knoppix and its kin, or Longhorn. \* OK this was at WinHEC -- [PCI express over external cabling](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1585024,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532). Love the idea of modular PCs. \* ATI responds to Nvidia announces with the [X800](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1583522,00.asp?kc=PCRSS02129TX1K0000530). With lower power consumption and single slot design, seems like ATI will crush Nvidia in the marketplace. \* Silent PCs at [Hush](http://www.engadget.com/entry/6674704157170114/) and [OMWave](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1894568467945434/). Interesting, both Euro companies, is the silent pc design point gaining ground faster in Europe? \* [Ewrt](http://postneo.com/2004/04/30.html#a3387) -- alternative firmware for the Linksys WRT54G -- seems like lots of hacking going on around this hardware.
