**OSU beats Texas Tech**. A good first outing -- [Recap - Texas Tech at Ohio State - 08/24/2002](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=222360194). Great running game -- linework, Maurice Clarett, way to go! A passing game that wasn't a drawback tho there could be a lot of improvement. Signs of defensive strength tho they let too many points get on the board. On to Kent State!
