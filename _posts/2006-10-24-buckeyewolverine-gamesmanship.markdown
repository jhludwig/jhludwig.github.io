From [Michigan Monday](http://www.the-ozone.net/football/2006/minnesota/michiganmonday.htm)

_It also means that we are now in that portion of the season where Michigan and Ohio State are showing each other purposeful looks. Michigan went with five wides and five and six-man fronts. The Buckeyes, meanwhile, are throwing passes with Ted Ginn. Even though the games may not be that interesting leading up to November 18, the gamesmanship sure will be._

This is exactly right. The next three games are all about showing the opponent just what you want them to see. I bet that some parts of the OSU offensive seem strangely ineffective for the next 3 games.
