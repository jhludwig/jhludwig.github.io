[A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: Not too happy with my Drobo](http://www.theludwigs.com/2008/01/not_too_happy_with_my_drobo.html "A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: Not too happy with my Drobo") -- I did finally get a support call with Drobo and they got it working. I had to go twiddle a BIOS setting having to do with legacy USB support. The Drobo folks claim this is the BIOS manufacturer's fault and assert that other mass storage USB devices will fail as well. However I have had no problems with a variety of generic USB housings and with a LaCie box so I don't think the Drobo folks have this really figured out yet. Additionally the Drobo software decided to grab drive M for their use which was bad as I already had a network drive mapped to M. So that was chunky and painful.

The box seems to work fine now tho.
