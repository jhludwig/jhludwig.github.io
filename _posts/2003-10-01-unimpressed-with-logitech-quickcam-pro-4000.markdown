I just installed this -- [Logitech > Cameras > QuickCam? Pro 4000](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?page=products/details&CRID=4&CONTENTID=5042&countryid=19&languageid=1 "Logitech > Cameras > QuickCam? Pro 4000") -- and so far I am underwhelmed. Audio doesn't seem to work -- a USB problem? Comes with a mountain of shovelware, some of which seems to be nearly spyware. I tried to send video to an AIM buddy, and the software on my end to bring up my picklist of AIM buddies was very slow, and on the other end, it nearly hung the receiver's machine. And they never saw a picture (firewall/nat problems?). I'll try it with MSN Messenger next but not a great first 30 minutes.
