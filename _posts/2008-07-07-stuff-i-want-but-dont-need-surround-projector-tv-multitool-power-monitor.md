\* [Mitsubishi Ultra Thin Frame Premium Flat Panel TV with Integrated Sound Projector Â» Coolest Gadgets](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080701/mitsubishi-ultra-thin-frame-premium-flat-panel-tv-with-integrated-sound-projector/) -- cool. I have a discrete sound projector in one room and have been happy with. this is a great way to get surround sound with minimal fuss. \* At the other end of the price spectrum, the [Li'l Guppie Multi-tool](http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/tools/a905/). I am not sure I actually get much value out of multi-tools but they look cool. \* [Realtime power use monitor](http://www.terrapass.com/blog/posts/reducing-energy-usage-step-1-measure-it) -- this actually seems pretty useful.
