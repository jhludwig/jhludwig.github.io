Look at the first half of this schedule:

- Aug. 30 - vs. Navy (at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium)
- Sept. 13 - Kent State
- Sept. 20 - Virginia Tech
- Sept. 27 - Cincinnati
- Oct. 4 - at Maryland
- Oct. 18 - Rutgers
- Oct. 25 - at Penn State

You'd not be able to tell this team was in the Big10 based on this. The center of mass of this schedule is somewhere like Hagerstown, Maryland.
