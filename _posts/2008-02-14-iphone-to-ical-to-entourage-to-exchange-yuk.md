OK this is starting to get really annoying. 70+ sync errors today with the iphone. seems to be mostly with recurring calendar events. grr. i know have my dad's birthday on my calendar like 8 times.

UPDATE: Oh fricking great. 1548 sync conflicts reported. What the hell am I supposed to do with that????

UPDATE: Oh double great. Now the Conflict Resolver is trying to sync an iCal event with a contact. Awesome. And trying to resolve a conflict between my mom's birthday and a basketball game -- "Select the correct Event information below"

The good news is now I can plausibly skip every meeting and say "gee it wasn't on my calendar"
