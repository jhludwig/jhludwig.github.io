**School Governance**. Will be attending the PNAIS [Governance Conference](http://www.pnais.org/programs/GovConf.html) in early November. Very interested to hear the mood of private school board members as the economy continues to struggle. And when you look at the demographics of this region, the potential market of students is flat or even shrinking a little over the next 10 years. And of course public schools are improving generally. I think we are in for greater levels of competition and greater questioning of the affordability and value of private education, which means we need to focus even more clearly on the quality of our product.
