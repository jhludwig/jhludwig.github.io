[Scout.com: Big Ten Roundup - Week 9 Standings & More](http://cfn.scout.com/2/805524.html). Sigh. A beautiful night and a hard fought effort by our guys, but we just made one mistake too many against a tough and disciplined opponent. Sigh. Was great to be back in Ohio Stadium for the first time in 20 years.

I've been to two games this year and both losses. I'm not feeling too lucky, I am bringing some of that bad Seattle sports mojo with me apparently.
