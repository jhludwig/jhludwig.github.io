"Slumdog Millionaire":imdb, "Milk":imdb, "Gran Torino":imdb -- all fabulous in their own ways. Slumdog for some scenes into a country and culture and lives that are unforgettable; Milk for a view into our history that is moving and inspiring, and for great acting; Gran Torino for great acting in a touching and surprisingly humorous story.
