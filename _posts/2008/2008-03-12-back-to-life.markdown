OK website alive again. Sadly the feed location has changed for RSS readers and I am not sure what to do about that. oh i guess i can add a redirect. i'll get cracking on that.

Why dead for a week? Well I tried to change blog software (movabletype to wordpress), hosting (my own server to siteground), and dns registration (network solutions to siteground) all at once. too many moving parts. i got locked in a weird state with dns pointing in the wrong location and dns being locked up due to the domain name registration transfer. lesson learned
