[Photo Tools: FDR Tool, PortraitProfessional, Lumapix, Digi-labs | Tongfamily.com](http://www.tongfamily.com/2008/06/photo-tools-fdr-tool-portraitprofessional-lumapix-digi-labs/) -- lots of great tips here. I am currently using Aperture and Noise Ninja, with an occasional dip in Adobe Elements -- I can't bring myself to spring for Photoshop but may this fall when I have access to academic pricing. For a self-proclaimed Mac convert, Rich sure uses a lot of Windows software...
