[Danny Glasser: The Road to HD: QAM to the rescue?](http://dglasser.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!E5964786241000A!1180.entry "Danny Glasser: The Road to HD: QAM to the rescue?") -- Danny is concocting the most complicated Rube Golbergian system possible to try to watch HD. Good luck! I might suggest just buying a TivoHD box and slipping a cablecard in it, you will have immediate HD football goodness.
