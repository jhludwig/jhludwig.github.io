\* [Coghlan's - Product Display](http://www.coghlans.com/catalogue/productList.php?catID=12) -- mini lantern and clipon headlamp. I'd actually use the headlamp \* [Easyroaster](http://toolmonger.com/2008/04/15/easy-roaster/). Cool but I don't really like hotdogs or smores. \* [Yaktrax traction control](http://www.brettonstuff.com/index.php/backpacking/yaktrax-traction-control/). I rarely try to hike on snow. \* [Mini Tissues](http://www.brettonstuff.com/index.php/backpacking/mini-tissue/). Just because I like the rehydration aspect. \* [Lightweight drybags](http://www.brettonstuff.com/index.php/backpacking/sea-to-summit-dry-bag/). Maybe I should just pay Brett to outfit me. \* [Carbon fiber tripods](http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/03/03/carbon-fiber-tripods-from-manfrotto/). These claim to be lightweight but is this really the lightest possible?
