We have these plastic Stockli 7 liter watering cans that we love -- but after years of use they are breaking down. I can't find any US source for them which is a bummer. But these [Dramm - Watering Cans](http://www.dramm.com/html/main.isx?sub=24) seem to be an equivalent and are available widely. So we will give them a try -- the 7L size are great for outdoor use -- big enough to carry a lot of water, but not so big that they are unusable.
