\* "Ender in Exile":amazon by Orson Scott Card. It has been probably 20 years since I read Ender's Game, and this new book does not stand alone. And so at first I was frustrated. But the characters remain appealing and the story deals with meaty post-war issues that are relevant to our times. \* "The Reluctant Communist":amazon by Charles Robert Jenkins with Jim Frederick. True story of a deserter who spent 40 years in North Korea. The insane self-imposed rigors of everyday life in North Korea are stunning.
