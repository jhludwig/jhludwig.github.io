[Edison PC Power Management Software | Edison](http://www.verdiem.com/edison/) -- tried on my home machine but had to uninstall. It is lipstick on a chicken -- a nicer UI than the default Windows power management UI but that is all it is. If the underlying hardware doesn't nicely support suspend, then this tool does nothing and that is my case -- my desktop will not reliably recover from suspend, I have no idea why. Hangs on unsuspend, and on reboot, my video resolution was set back to VGA resolution.
