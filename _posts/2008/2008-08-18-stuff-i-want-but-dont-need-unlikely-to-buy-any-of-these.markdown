\* [Pizza pizza. - Core77](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/pizza_pizza_10838.asp) - awesome looking pizza maker. I make pizzas at home about once a decade so probably not a smart buy, would end up in the countertop appliance graveyard along with the breadmaker etc. \* [pick chair](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/pick_chair_folds_flatter_than_my_wallet_10841.asp) folds flat and hangs on wall, looks awesome. Hopefully it actually works as a chair too. \* [ExpandOS](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/002985.php) packing material. Hate styrofoam peanuts, love recyclable packing materials \* [Miracle tablets turn sour tastes sweet](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080813/miracle-berry-fruit-tablets-turn-sour-into-sweet/). This just seems wrong \* [Robopong](http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/08/13/robopong-lets-you-play-friendless-table-tennis/) table tennis opponent. Kind of a sad statement. \* [Weight-sensitive floor lights up](http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/08/13/weight-sensitive-floor-lights-up-where-you-step-on-it-looks-futuristic/). Awesome, in the age of green awareness, now we can embed all kinds of computational power and lights into our flooring. \* A [$1200 moosehead wall lamp](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080813/the-moo-wall-lamp-%E2%80%93-a-modern-twist-to-hunting/). I'm surprised I don't have one already.
