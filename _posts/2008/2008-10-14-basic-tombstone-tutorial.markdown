[Here you go](http://www.mourningcemetery.com/Projects/crane/index.htm) via [Make](http://www.makezine.com). I wouldn't use beaded styrofoam personally, i'd go with the blue/pink sheets of insulation, they cut a little more cleanly. But a fine guide, i like the way they used a greeting card as a stencil.
