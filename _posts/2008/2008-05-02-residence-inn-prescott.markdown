[Residence Inn Prescott: Spacious suites and amenities for longer stays](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/prcri-residence-inn-prescott/) -- this place is amazing. I've stayed in a number of Residence Inns, this one is fairly new and has great furnishings, interesting room designs, full set of services. Amazingly nice, much much nicer than the typical Residence Inn
