- [Flexible CNT circuits move on - nanotechweb.org](http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/tech/35130).  Just one of many efforts to implant circuits onto papers, plastics, etc.  We are going to have processing power embedded in pretty much everything.
- [Work on nanonet circuits](http://www.physorg.com/news136037378.html) -- ok this stuff is all a long way from commercialization, they can only create circuits with 100 elements, but still cool
