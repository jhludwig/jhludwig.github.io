Mostly because it is not available yet:

- [MAKE: Blog: 4 floor advanced engineering demolition toy set](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/12/4_floor_advanced_engineering_demoli.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890). This appears to be sold out, site is hammered. Way cool
- [Kindle 2](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/25/amazon-kindle-2-slated-for-early-q1/). Love my existing Kindle, still.
- [Addonics NAS adapter](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2008/12/addonics_nas_adapter.html). World's smallest NAS. Probably has perf and reliability to match, but still cool.
- [Sony VAIO CP1 picture frame](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080904/sony-vaio-cp1-digital-photo-frame/) -- feature packed but hardly available and expensive.
