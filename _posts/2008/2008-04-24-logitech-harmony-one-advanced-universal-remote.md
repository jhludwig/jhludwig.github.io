[Logitech > Remotes > Universal Remotes > HarmonyÂ® One Advanced Universal Remote](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/3898&cl=us,en) -- I'm pretty happy with this remote. I've used Harmonys in the past and they were easy to config but I found them to be finicky in actual use. This one tho seems to be much more reliable -- when I tell it to turn on my Tivo, AVR, and monitor all at once, it does it quickly without a hiccup.
