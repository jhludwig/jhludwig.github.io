[Scott Hanselman's Computer Zen - Make your Website Mobile and iPhone Friendly - Add Home Screen iPhone Icons and Adjust the ViewPort](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MakeYourWebsiteMobileAndIPhoneFriendlyAddHomeScreenIPhoneIconsAndAdjustTheViewPort.aspx). Nice, the icon tip is really good, my icon is pretty bitchin'.Â  The viewport thing didnt do quite as expected, i probably need to understand better what this tag is doing and think about wrt my layout.
