[iPhone servers crumble under activation strain | Electricpig](http://www.electricpig.co.uk/2008/07/11/iphone-servers-crumble-under-activation-strain/) -- exactly where I am at this morning. Has screwed up my entire day. Thanks much Apple. Who had the idea to disable every single freaking existing iPhone as part of this process?????

UPDATE: ok i am past that hurdle and my phone is doing a really slow re-sync. Progress.

MORE: what a freaking disaster. now itunes just crashed hard (on the mac). in the middle of a sync. not happy.
