Excited about updating my body.  Rich is excited about the new Canon 50D -- [Woohoo Canon 50D at 15MP and its own 18-200 super zoom | Tongfamily.com](http://www.tongfamily.com/2008/09/woohoo-canon-50d-at-15mp-and-its-own-18-200-super-zoom/)

And then the 5d Mark II is supposed to be coming out.

Now it looks like maybe [RED is going to try to turn the market on its ear?](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080901/after-camcorders-red%E2%80%99s-new-target-looks-to-be-digital-slrs/) Wow.  Good time to be a customer.
