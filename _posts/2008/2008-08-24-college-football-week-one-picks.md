My buddy Tim runs a little pickem content and the first week slate is out:

\* August 28 North Carolina State vs. South Carolina. I don't think NC State is there yet \* August 29 Temple vs. Army. ugh. Army i guess \* August 30 Utah vs. Michigan. I think Michigan will have a lot of emotion and will win this \* Syracuse vs. Northwestern. Northwestern. Never take Syracuse \* Virginia Tech vs. East Carolina. VT \* Michigan State vs. California. Hmm, MSU is the favorite darkhorse in the big10 this year. But hard to win on the west coast. \* Hawaii vs. Florida. Florida \* Alabama vs. Clemson. Oh damn, Clemson is a trendy pick, but I have never won picking Clemson \* Missouri at Illinois. Mizzou. Illinois strugges to repeat last year's breakthru \* Washington vs. Oregon. Hmm, Oregon is confused at QB, UW is not. \* August 31 Kentucky vs. Louisville. Ugh, no respect for these teams. Probably take Louisville \* Sept 1 Fresno State vs. Rutgers. Take Rutgers at home \* Tennessee vs. UCLA. UCLA not ready for primetime yet
