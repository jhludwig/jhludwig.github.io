[House Rejects Bailout Package, 228-205; Stocks Plunge - NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/30bailout.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin) -- wow. going to get uglier. i think main street wants to see people going to jail, i don't think constituents are going to turn around and support this until some of the folks who got incredibly wealthy are brought down.
