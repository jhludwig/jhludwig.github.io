Very interested in products that make us smarter about our energy use at home. [Sean reports on his use of TED](http://wartigger.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!7BC1A1AC02CC64D2!159.entry) -- the TED device lets you get finegrained reports on your electricity use, and with a little playing around you can get smart about use circuit-by-circuit as Sean reports. I have to try one of these out.

[Silver Spring Networks](http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/10--silver-spring-networks--806.html) seems to be building out a really complete energy monitoring and reporting solution, worth learning about.

[Phil highlights](http://thebogles.com/blog/2008/04/john-doerr-on-green-tech/) some recent comments from Doerr on the energy opportunity -- excellent elevator speech
