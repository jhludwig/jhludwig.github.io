- [Brett on Stuff Â» Distilleries of Scotland](http://www.brettonstuff.com/index.php/backpacking/distilleries-of-scotland/). A reason to hike Scotland
- [WOW](http://lifehacker.com/5103852/would-you-pay-7-for-two+factor-online-banking-authentication) -- stronger authentication than your bank. What does that say about the world.
- [Running DC thru the house](http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/a-current-in-every-ceiling-5278.html). An idea whose time has come again?
- [Indie games DB](http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/11/22/tigdb-the-indie-games-database/). Often way better than mainstream games
- [Guided Bullets.](http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/11/what-if-a-snipe.html) Why not.
- [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/). Kind of an open source design site.
- [Denhaus](http://www.denhaus.com/) -- awesome pet furniture
- [Nitrogen-infused golf clubs](http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/11/13/nitrogen-infused-golf-clubs-mimic-big-swing-speeds/). Golfers will buy anything.
- [Dutch 5 Euro coin](http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/user%2F07916954266999182530%2Fstate%2Fcom.google%2Fstarred). Awesome, wish I could order. Not the first time I have been blocked from ordering a euro product, wish I could sign up for a forwarding PO box in Europe.
- [Mini Magnetosphere](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2008/11/mini_magnetosphere_to_prevent_astronauts_from_cosmic_rays.html). Maybe we all need one of these
