- [Plex Media Center for OS X](http://plexapp.com/).  Very nice looking and I always get sucked into the idea of media center software...but at the end of the day I don't think I would use it
- Rich on [Fission](http://www.tongfamily.com/2008/08/audiobook-cd-backup-with-max-mac-fission-for-splitting-and-mp3-trimmer-for-joining/)
- Rich on [how to see invisible files](http://www.tongfamily.com/2008/08/mac-os-x-invisible-files/)
- [Transmit](http://lifehacker.com/5039956/five-best-ftp-clients).  Not sure it will displace filezilla for me
