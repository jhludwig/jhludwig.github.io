- [Fluidforms :: Individual Design](http://fluidforms.eu/shop/catalog/index-cPath-21.html). -- awesome topographical bowls and other objects.
- [Drippable adhesives as sculpting medium](http://fourteensquarefeet.com/08/project/untitled-abraham-lincoln/).  There are some cool Halloween designs hiding in this idea
- [Fire fighting gun](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/fight_fire_with_a_meanlooking_gun_10941.asp).  Makes you want to have a fire nearby.
- [Bits needed for making wooden train tracks](http://toolmonger.com/2008/08/27/make-your-own-wooden-train-track/) -- i just like the idea of doing this
- [Recycled tire mulch](http://toolmonger.com/2008/08/27/permanent-mulch-from-recycled-tires/) -- this actually seems like a disaster, i have a hard time believing all our plants would love this.
- [Good looking LED desk lights](http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2008/08/five_led_task_l.php)
- [Beyond the lunchpail and thermos](http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2008/08/nine_lunch_boxe.php).  The Mr Bento one is cool
