Lots of great energy stuff up at the DOE site -- including [Solid-State Lighting: Research Highlights](http://www.netl.doe.gov/ssl/lft.html "Solid-State Lighting: Research Highlights") which has their award winners for solid state lighting last year. I've tried some of the inexpensive commercially available LEDs and they suck. I'm going ty try out one of these more expensive [can replacements](http://www.llfinc.com/index.aspx)
