[NASA space colonies](http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/06/the-lost-space.html) -- awesome, I remember these pix from back in the day, very inspiring.

My other strange space link of the day -- something about [Nazi invaders from the moon](http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/06/03/a-conversation-with-john-buckman-about-nazi-invaders-from-the-moon-and-other-things/). I too would watch any movie with this premise in a minute.
