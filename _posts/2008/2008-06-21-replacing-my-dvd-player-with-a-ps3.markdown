Spent the morning hooking up my birthday present -- a PS3. Replacing my DVD player.

One major bummer is the PS3's use of bluetooth for remote. While I appreciate an RF solution versus an IR solution, as the [PS3 boards note](http://boardsus.playstation.com/playstation/board/message?board.id=ps3&message.id=909652), no universal remote will currently work with the PS3. So sigh, I have to keep yet another remote around. Bummer.

Also my AV receiver is a few years old and doesn't support HDMI and so I have to use RGB + Digital Audio connectors. My AV receiver is in a tight cabinet and so I have to work largely blind plugging cables in, this was painful. HDMI would be nice for reduction of cables.
