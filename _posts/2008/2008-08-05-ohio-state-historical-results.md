[BuckeyeXtra - The Columbus Dispatch : Ohio State football results](http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/buckeyextra/database/OSUresults.html). -- nice new service from the Dispatch.  9-11-1 against USC all time, 0-5 in last 5 games.  Let's hope Tressel can reverse this trend as he has reversed others
