> I'm not sure which was more disappointing: Ohio State's defense trying to defend Joe McKnight, or the Buckeyes' insistence on Todd Boeckman, who has never been anything but a red siren liability when asked to make plays with the game on the line. To me, it's clearly Boeckman: while McKnight gashed OSU's defense for almost nine yards per carry, the Buckeyes would have been in the game well into the second half if not for a) Boeckman's throw directly into the arms of Rey Maulauga for a USC touchdown in the second quarter, and b) his cement-footed stand in the pocket on the very next possession, when he was sacked on consecutive snaps and stripped (above) on the second just to make a nice picture of his helpless inadequacy. Both turnovers, for the record, followed first down runs by Terrelle Pryor.

Totally agree but to be clear -- not Boeckman's fault. He is what he is and that is well known by now. The fault lies with the coaching, expecting him to be something he is not.
