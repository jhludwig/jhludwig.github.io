Just ordered [Amazon.com: Advance Wars: Days of Ruin: Video Games](http://www.amazon.com/Advance-Wars-Days-of-Ruin/dp/B000XJNTMY/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1201809886&sr=8-1 "Amazon.com: Advance Wars: Days of Ruin: Video Games") based on the NYTimes review today. Have to wonder -- when will we see a DS with wireless integration like the Kindle? I don't buy games that often, cartridges and manuals are a pain, why can't I just download the games wirelessly?
