- [OHS - Places - Harding Home](http://ohsweb.ohiohistory.org/places/c03/index.shtml). Contains almost all the original furnishings of Harding.
- [Harding Tomb](http://ohsweb.ohiohistory.org/places/c04/) -- tho we always called it the Harding Memorial. When I was very very young I was skinny enough to slip thru the bars.
- [Other Marion Museums](http://www.downtownmarion.com/database.shtml?ID=4846132052005) -- the Stengel-True Museum, Unuion Station, the Wyandot Popcorn Museum. Wyandot historically produced much of the popping corn in the country...
- Hence the annual [Popcorn Festival](http://www.popcornfestival.com/)
- [The Palace Theatre](http://www.marionpalace.org/), a shockingly nice theatre for this size town. Built during Marion's heydays in the 1920s...
- Unfortunately there is nothing much to see from Marion's industrial boom days, but from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion,_Ohio): "Products of the Marion Steam Shovel Company (later [Marion Power Shovel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Power_Shovel "Marion Power Shovel")) built the [Panama Canal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal "Panama Canal") and in the 1960s, [NASA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") contracted with Power Shovel to construct the crawler-transporters that moved the assembled [Saturn V](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V "Saturn V") rockets, used by [Project Apollo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Apollo "Project Apollo"), to the launch pad. In 1911, 80% of the nation's steam shovel and heavy duty earth moving equipment was manufactured in Marion, Ohio." I worked 3 summers for the Shovel.
- Nearby towns -- [Waldo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo,_Ohio) (Home of the G&R, famous for fried balogna sandwiches), [LaRue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaRue,_Ohio) (smallest town ever to have an NFL franchise)
