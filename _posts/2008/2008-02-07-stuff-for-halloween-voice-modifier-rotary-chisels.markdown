\* [digital voice changer kit](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2008/02/digital_voice_changer_kit.html "digital voice changer kit") -- I already have a voice mod box that I use with a large prop, but this might be a nice one to use on my person as part of a costume. \* [Rotary Chisels](http://toolmonger.com/2008/02/05/remove-almost-any-material-with-a-rotary-chisel/) -- look great for carving tombstones etc.
