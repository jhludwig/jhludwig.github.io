[Harvesting the Sun's Energy with Antennas](http://www.inl.gov/featurestories/2007-12-17.shtml "Harvesting the Sun's Energy with Antennas") -- it sure seems like at some point we may see a "moore's law" type effect in solar cells -- dramatic increases in efficiency with dramatic cost drops. Will never be as longlived as the Moore's Law phenomenom since efficiency is capped but still seems like we will see great improvements.
