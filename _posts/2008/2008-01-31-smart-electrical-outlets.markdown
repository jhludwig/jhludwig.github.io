Recently had some new GFCI outlets installed in my house like these -- [The Phantom GFCI - Popular Mechanics](http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/home_journal_news/3487002.html "The Phantom GFCI - Popular Mechanics") -- the addition of an LED letting me know if the outlet is live is brilliant! And then I saw this prototype -- [a light switch that responds to smoke alarms](http://toolmonger.com/2008/01/29/lights-on-with-the-firelight-safety-switch/). I love the idea of embedding cheap electronics into our electrical system -- I'd really love it if somehow my switches and outlets could all report current energy use; that would help me start to change behaviour re conservation.
