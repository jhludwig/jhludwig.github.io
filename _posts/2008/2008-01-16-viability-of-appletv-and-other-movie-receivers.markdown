[Scott Hanselman's Computer Zen - Long Term Viability of AppleTV](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LongTermViabilityOfAppleTV.aspx "Scott Hanselman's Computer Zen - Long Term Viability of AppleTV") -- I wonder about this too. It seems like there are a kajillion boxes (for instance [XStreamHD](http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/01/08/michael-douglas-loves-xstreamhd-so-should-you/)) and offerings (for instance [Amazon Unbox](http://www.amazon.com/Unbox-Video-Downloads/b?ie=UTF8&node=16261631)) in this space. My gut tells me that this kind of service is going to get rolled into every settop box, dvd player, game console, just like DVR capability is getting rolled in. The need for a separate box is not apparent to me. I think this dynamic is going to kill off DVD players and their hidef ilk as well.
