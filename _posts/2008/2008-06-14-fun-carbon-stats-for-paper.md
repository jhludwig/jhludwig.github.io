[GreenPDF](http://www.greenpdf.com/graphics/TheGreenPDFRevolution.pdf) has a ton of info about the carbon costs of paper, fun to read. i am not sure why they commingle the message with PDF adoption, that seems strange, but the numbers are fun. we've invested in a couple companies that combat the use of paper -- [Docusign](http://www.docusign.com/), [Earth Class Mail](http://www.earthclassmail.com/) -- so I feel kind of good that we are helping to fight the good fight
