[StorageMojo » Our changing file workloads](http://storagemojo.com/2008/09/09/our-changing-file-workloads/) Interesting study results. Some of the things that fascinate me:

\* Files rarely re-opened. Over 66% are re-opened once and 95% fewer than 5 times. Over 60% of file re-opens are within a minute of the first open. \* over 90% of the active storage was untouched during the study

hmm, providing a backup service has to be profitable given this info.
