[Imagenomic - Imagination at Shutter Speed](http://www.imagenomic.com/download_nwsa.aspx "Imagenomic - Imagination at Shutter Speed") -- free and pro versions of noise filtering software -- standalone and plugin version. seems to do a great job, has a depth of features that I haven't begun to tap. I paid for the pro version so I could get the batch feature, I have a couple thousand pictures from bball season taken in gyms with crappy lighting.
