I've had it with 1800flowers, with proflowers, with marthastewart's site. In the past year I've ordered flowers from each and they have all resulted in various disasters -- flowers never arrived, arrived damaged, or were pathetically bad.

From now on I am dealing with real human beings at local florists. [Lindvall florist](mailto:http://www.lindvallflorist.com/) in Florida, [Marion Flower Shop](http://www.marionflowershop.com/) in Ohio.

This points out a large flaw in current SEO-crazed environment -- pissing away a lot of money on SEO and SEM is pointless if you can't back it up with a solid operation. You need to do something well, something of real value, before you start trying to slurp up traffic.
