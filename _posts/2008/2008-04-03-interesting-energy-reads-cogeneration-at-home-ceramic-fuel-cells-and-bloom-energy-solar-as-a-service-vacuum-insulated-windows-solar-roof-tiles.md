\* [The Oil Drum | Cogeneration At Home: Ceramic Fuel Cells And Bloom Energy](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3723) \* "[Solar as a Service](http://www.recurrentenergy.com/service/)" -- i like the phrasing \* [Vacuum-insulated glass windows](http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1482/) -- makes sense, I wonder what the effective life of these are \* [Solar Roof Tiles](http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/03/13/solar-panels-from-srs-install-like-normal-asphalt-roofing/) -- nice notion. It will be interesting to see the degree to which we can embed solar and green technology into everyday materials.
