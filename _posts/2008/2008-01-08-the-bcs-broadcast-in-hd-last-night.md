To my eyes, the game was actually painful to watch in HD -- I was watching [Q13 FOX](http://q13.trb.com/ "Q13.com | KCPQ TV | Q13 FOX News") on [Comcast](http://www.comcast.com). You could detect noticeable interframe jitter, it was particularly noticeable when the camera panned down the field, the white yard stripes would show a lot of jumping. I don't notice this on most ESPN football broadcasts -- is this because ESPN is 720p whereas Fox is 1080i? I don't know for sure but it was painful, and not just because the Buckeyes were stumbling.
