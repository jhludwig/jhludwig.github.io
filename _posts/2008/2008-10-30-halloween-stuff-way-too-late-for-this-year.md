\* [Twitchie robot kit](http://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=MKTET2). Looks like fun innards for a bunch of different props. \* Great [singing skull](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/10/singing_skull.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890). \* [Haunted bookshelf](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/10/haunted_books.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890). Don't love the prop but really enjoy the cam mechanism, turning simple rotary motion into something more interesting.

Second time I've tried to post this. The WordPress PressThis bookmarklet is remarkably buggy.
