[![](images/gm-logo.jpg "GM")Marginal Revolution: GM fact of the day](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/12/gm-fact-of-the.html). Wow. Market cap 1/3 of bed bath and beyond. Worth 10% of apple's cash. 96K employees but paying benefits for 1M people. Some of the numbers are a little misleading but still.
