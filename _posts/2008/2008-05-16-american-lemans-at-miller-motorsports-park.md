My god what a [facility](http://www.millermotorsportspark.com/eventView.php?event_id=99) -- brand spanking new, huge, a variety of viewing from plain bleachers to delux clubhouse. Great views from all kinds of places. And the pit activity today is fascinating with 3-4 classes of cars all mixing it up. Worth the trip.
