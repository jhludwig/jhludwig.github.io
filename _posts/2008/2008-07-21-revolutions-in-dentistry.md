[Toward the end of the dentist drill?](http://www.primidi.com/2008/07/21.html#a2249) -- I grew up with a great family dentist but since adulthood my experiences have not been as good, and I sure hope that technologies like this come to fruition. I hope a hundred years from now people look back at 20th century dentistry and shudder at the barbarism of it all.
