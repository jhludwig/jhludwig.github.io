['Naked-eye' gamma-ray burst was aimed squarely at Earth | Science Blog](http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/naked-eye-gamma-ray-burst-was-aimed-squarely-earth-17351.html) -- ok they claim it came from a source 7.5 billion light years away, but it sure seems strangely coincidental that it was pointed straight at us. Maybe they are pissed about the hadron collider.
