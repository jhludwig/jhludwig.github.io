[Data Robotics, Inc. | Knowledge Base](http://www.drobo.com/support_knowledge_base.aspx "Data Robotics, Inc. | Knowledge Base") -- these things are getting fab reviews but

\* my PC won't boot with it attached -- apparently there is some bios tweak i can do -- yuck \* and even when i can see it, the pc doesn't recognize it as a drive

the hardware seems nice but this is too much trouble.
