[A SWOT Analysis On America](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2008/10/a-swot-analysis.html). Don't agree with many of the detailed points but the core idea of looking at our situation with a SWOT analysis is a good idea.  Too often as I read the papers these days, I don't really understand the goals and strategies of some of our government actions.  A reasoned discussion with a clear decision framework would be nice.
