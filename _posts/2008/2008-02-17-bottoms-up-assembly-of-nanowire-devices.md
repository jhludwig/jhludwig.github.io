[Nanowire arrays think big - nanotechweb.org](http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/tech/32880 "Nanowire arrays think big - nanotechweb.org") -- bottoms up, "organic" assembly of nanowires. Some technique like this is going to be necessary for nanowire devices. And solving the general problem of bottoms up chip assembly seems pretty high value.
