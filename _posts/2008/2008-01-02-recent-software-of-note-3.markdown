\* [Remember the Googley Milk](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/12/remember-googley-milk.html "Remember the Googley Milk") -- major hole on iphone is lack of a todo list. this is my current favorite replacement. Nice PC UI. \* [Flot javascript graphing library](http://code.google.com/p/flot/). or there is what looks to be a [server-side google alternative](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/). Now I am embarrassed I have never put a graph on my site. \* [Price Advance](http://www.priceadvance.com/download). don't know how well it works but seems worthy of a trial \* [Crossloop](https://www.crossloop.com/landing.htm). Remote screen control plus a peer to peer service to help others. I like the business model thinking. \* [Resize any window.](http://lifehacker.com/software/featured-windows-download/resize-any-window-with-resizableenable-325452.php) Sad that I even understand why I need this. \* [Single file defrag.](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897428.aspx) I bet I will need this someday \* [Senuti](http://www.fadingred.org/senuti/) iPod backup \* [Ebay Desktop](http://desktop.ebay.com/). Kind of nice tho late and really why is this an app and not just a better website? \* [Mac disk usage](http://db.tidbits.com/article/9233) utilities
