[The Big Picture | A Memo Found in the Street](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/09/uncle-sam-the-e.html).  [Icahn is harsh too](http://www.icahnreport.com/report/2008/09/bailout-plan-mu.html) and advocates clawbacks.  [Gross willing to manage the assets for free](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/09/gross-manage-ta.html) so hopefully we don't pay anyone a lot for this work.  The longer this thing runs out, the less sympathetic I am to the bailout.  And it appears Congress is not a pushover either so I guess that is good.
