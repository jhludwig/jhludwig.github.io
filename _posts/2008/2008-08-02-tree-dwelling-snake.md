I forgot to point out that I guest-posted over on [Jim's blog this week](http://www.xwordblog.com/2008/07/tree-dwelling-snake.html) -- Jim runs an amazing crossword reference site at [XWordInfo](http://www.xwordinfo.com/). Jim is a great and smart guy with a set of interests that sometimes intersects minge (crosswords) and sometimes is oh so different -- _["I have a theory that nobody loves both Fellini and Bergman. You have to pick one and that determines much about your life."](http://www.xwordblog.com/2008/08/yet-more-reader-mail.html)_
