Getting geared up for this game already. A classic for so many reasons.

First of all, a great personal history with the Buckeyes -- been at their games since I was a kid, we are alums, my father played for [Woody](http://www.centralohio.com/ohiostate/football/legacy/coaches/hayes.html), my grandfather was an alum.

Amd the schools have a great [history](http://www.jhowell.net/cf/Scores/OhioState.htm), particularly in the Rose Bowl. My dad was on the team for the '55 win and national championship; I remember the great '69 and '74 wins, and still suffer from the '73, '75, '80, and '85 losses. I hated [John McKay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McKay_(football_coach)) and his teams.

In this century, [Jim Tressel](http://www.jimtressel.com/) and [Pete Carroll](http://www.petecarroll.com/) have arguably been the best coaches with the best programs, albeit stylistically very differently -- Tressel is buttoned-up, a solid midwestern values kind of guy. Pete is a flashy new media loosey-goosey kind of guy, and I have hated him.

So a great early season matchup this year, and particularly so, because a family member will now be attending USC! So I am going to have to cheer for the Trojans in every game except the OSU matchup -- that is going to take some getting used to.
