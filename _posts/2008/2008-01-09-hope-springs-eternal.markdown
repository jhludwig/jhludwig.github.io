[Opinion: Third title game will be charm for Buckeyes - College football- msnbc.com](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22548680/ "Opinion: Third title game will be charm for Buckeyes - College football- msnbc.com") -- yes people are seriously picking OSU to get back to the title game again next year. Me, well, I'm not so sure. Some serious offensive learning and development needs to take place. All the stupid penalty stuff can get fixed easily, and the effort was there.

Like the [Columbus Dispatch dudes](http://blog.dispatch.com/buckeyesblog/2008/01/year_in_reviewin_five_sentence.shtml), I am starting to wonder if the current system is really good for OSU. The 50 day layoff seems to have been better used by LSU and Florida. I am starting to lean towards a gasp playoff, and a Big-10 schedule delayed a week (already happening), to get rid of the layoff and compress prep time for teams.
