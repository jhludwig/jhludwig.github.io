[Ask The Readers: How Do You Recession-Proof Your Career?](http://lifehacker.com/347756/how-do-you-recession proof-your-career "Ask The Readers: How Do You Recession-Proof Your Career?") -- some ideas from others.

In my first real job, a wise mentor who had lived through recessions and layoffs gave me this advice:

\* Make sure you are working on a product that your company cares about. "Cares about" is generally equivalent to "important to the company's overall profitability". If the company doesn't care that much what happens to your product/business, well, that is not good. \* You can either make things or sell things. These are the two functions that are relatively impervious to layoffs. If you are not directly involved in the making or the selling of your company's product/service, well, also not good.
