\* "Watchmen":amazon by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Wow, excellent. Better as a graphic novel than it could have been as a book, the use of text and font and images to intertwine multiple stories works very well. You have to think as you read. \* "Where Are The Customer's Yachts?":amazon by Fred Schwed Jr. Timeless classic, its crtiticism of the financial services industry and customers' foolishness is still dead on. \* "Broken Angels":amazon By Richard K Morgan. Another Kovacs novel, this one wasn't a home run for me. With all the morally ambiguous factions, I could never quite get Kovacs' motivations. And his drawn out death postponed by one miracle drug after another quit working for me. The whole thing felt a little choppy and unmotivated. \* "Biomechanics of the Gastrointestinal Tract":amazon by Hans Gregersen. Interesting reference on the GI tract, treating it as a mechanical device and analyzing behaviour from that view. Useful to help you build up a complete picture.
