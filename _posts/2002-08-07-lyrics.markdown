**Lyrics**. Useful lyrics site -- [A-Z Lyrics Universe](http://www.azlyrics.com/index.html). I was looking for the lyrics to Foreigner's "That Was Yesterday" which has been stuck in my head:

_But that was yesterday I had the world in my hands But it's not the end of my world Just a slight change of plans_

A guilty pleasure. On a more fashionable note, the site also has the lyrics for all the White Stripes cds.
