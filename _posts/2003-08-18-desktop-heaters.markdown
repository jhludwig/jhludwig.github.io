[Hack the Planet](http://wmf.editthispage.com/2003/08/18 "Hack the Planet:") points to a [good article on Infoworld](http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/18/HNdarpasun_1.html) about Sun's work to get a supercomputer on the desk. "...heat management is by far the toughest problem..." -- i have this problem in spades now, we have 3 PCs around a table in my office at home, and two more in the closet + cablemodem + firewall + 2 printers + 3 firewire drives, and heat is a huge issue. Heat output will be a primary criteria in my next PC purchase.
