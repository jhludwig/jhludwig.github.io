[![](images/logo-header-fedex.png "logo-header-fedex")](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/logo-header-fedex.png)MSFT hasn't explained this very well -- all the first day orders are on their way, but MSFT didn't explain the tracking process to anyone. To track your shipment, find your Microsoft Store order number (format MS1234567890), strip the MS off the front, go to fedex.com, choose "track by reference", enter this code as a reference number along with your destination country and zip, and voila, there is your ship status.

Mine shipped the 23rd out of Suzhou, China and arrived in Seattle today. Should be delivered tomorrow.

Hat tip to @OhCompNetworks who got me started in the right direction. I tried calling the MS Store earlier in the day, that was a waste of time, they didn't seem to have a clue.
