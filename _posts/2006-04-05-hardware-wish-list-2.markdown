- [Moto m5 miniblue bluetooth headset](http://www.tongfamily.com/gadgets/phones/motorola_h5_miniblue_uhuru_here_we_come.php). Nice find rich. I will get one of these as soon as they exist.
- A mobile wifi hotspot like the [kyocera kr1](http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/kr1-router/).
- [Dymo handheld printer](http://global.dymo.com/enUS/Categories/RhinoPRO_Printers.html) for labelling cables, etc.
- SPU-based storage adapter like the [xfx revo](http://www.xfxforce.com/web/product/listConfigurations.jspa?seriesId=66&productId=834). All the benefits of raid, hot pluggability, way more flexible.
- [Hardware for routing A/V over cat5](http://www.avovercat5.com/products/v3ad.htm). I have a lot of cat5 in the house.
