\* [Tweetdeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/). Duh. \* [ECMerge](http://www.elliecomputing.com/Products/merge_overview.asp). I complained to Scooter Software about the lack of a mac version of [BeyondCompare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/), they kindly suggested ECMerge or [Araxis Merge](http://www.araxis.com/merge_mac/index.html). Araxis is way too expensive. ECMerge is solid but I still pine for BeyondCompare. \* [Toast Titanium](http://www.roxio.com/enu/products/toast/titanium/overview.html). I want a way to watch my Tivo shows on my mac and Toast seems to be the way to go. Seems to work well. \* [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/). I'm a sucker for math software. Only reasonable if you are an active student or your employer buys it for you. \* [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/). Another duh. THE way to watch wmvs on a mac (and UW lectures are all delivered in wmv format).

Oh and on the PC I am so in love with [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/). I don't even think about CD-based games anymore. Why isn't all Windows software delivered this way? Why hasn't Microsoft purchased Valve?
