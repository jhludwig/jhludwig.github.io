Needed some escapist reading and picked up [The Road to Armageddon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/193240709X/qid=1069866798//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/104-7738134-9854363?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: The Road to Armageddon") by Larry Collins based on a reco I read somewhere. What a piece of junk. Absolutely no style in his writing whatsoever. Nothing evocative at all. Uni-dimensional characters. Incredibly slow start. The pace picks up a little and I managed to get through the book but basically a piece of crap. Oh and a right-wing apologist theme all the way through; I am a little right of center myself but this was transparent and just plain painful to read. Even the binding on this book is crappy, like it came from a vanity press, not a commercial publisher.
