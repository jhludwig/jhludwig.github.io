In the context of a discussion about RSS use in place of newsletters, [Jon Udell asks](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/05/18.html#a1002 "Jon Udell: Random access to Web audio") _The obvious alternative is a personalized RSS feed. Does anyone have this already?_ What a great idea. Now if feedster provided this service, that would be something special.
