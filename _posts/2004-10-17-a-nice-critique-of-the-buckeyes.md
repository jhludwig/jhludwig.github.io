I was ready to flail away emotionally at the Buckeyes again, but [Dan over at Wizblog](http://www.danwismar.com/archives/wizblog/002447.html) has done a nice job rationally dissecting the performance. I have to agree, you have to pin the current level of performance on offensive coaching staff primarily, and on Tressel for backing them up. It is time to shake up the starting lineup and the staff.
