Like many people I have a mess of extra cables -- displays, ethernet, usb, sound/speaker of many flavors, firewire, etc etc etc. I used to just keep them in a tangled mess in a drawer.

But I had an unused shoe rack like this one -- [Chrome Over-the-Door Shoe Rack](http://www.wards.com/wards/prod_display1.asp?DMSIID=82&product=72419 "Chrome Over-the-Door Shoe Rack") -- it is pretty great for storing cables. Lots of ways to hook them over the shoe holders, easy to keep them organized by type, etc.
