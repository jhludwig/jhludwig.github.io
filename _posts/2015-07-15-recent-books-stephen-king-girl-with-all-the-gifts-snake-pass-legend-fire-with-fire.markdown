- [Finders Keepers](http://www.amazon.com/Finders-Keepers-Novel-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B00P42WROG) by Stephen King. A fine detective novel, but makes me miss the glory days of the author.
- [The Girl With All The Gifts](http://www.amazon.com/Girl-All-Gifts-M-Carey-ebook/dp/B00CO7FLFG) by M. R. Carey. Not all zombies are bad. Not all people are good. Maybe we should just let the zombies win.
- [Snake Pass](http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Pass-Resurrection-Man-Novel-ebook/dp/B00TONI5LU) by Colin Campbell. An attempt to start a Jack Reacher-like franchise, and not a bad attempt. I will read the next.
- [Legend](http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Novel-Book-1-ebook/dp/B0052RDJAO) by Marie Lu. Yet another post-apocalyptic dystopia. Probably better than most, but I don't know that I need another series in this genre.
- [Fire with Fire](http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Caine-Riordan-Book-ebook/dp/B00BVBRMDK), [Trial by Fire](http://www.amazon.com/Trial-Fire-Caine-Riordan-Book-ebook/dp/B00LUXNAYO) by Charles E. Gannon. Fun space romp with aliens, world-ending threats to humanity, interstellar politics, etc.
