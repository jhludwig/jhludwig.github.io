## CapEx

A meandering tour through capital expenditures.  First the semiconductor industry, where it is now estimated to [cost almost $20B to create a state-of-the-art fab](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/01/23/chipmaking-is-being-redesigned-effects-will-be-far-reaching).  Fab is now primarily done in SK and Taiwan, which is geopolitically risky for the US.  And our politicians mutter about on-shoring and good manufacturing jobs -- losing fab capability to offshore competitors seems like a horrible outcome both economically and geopolitically. Intel is facing this decision with a new CEO, I suspect the US government will find a way to help Intel keep fab capacity in the US.

Meanwhile, [Amazon/Google/Microsoft spent $73.5B in CapEx in 2020](http://www.platformonomics.com/2021/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2020-retrospective/).  Staggering numbers, particularly Amazon alone.  One has to be really brave to implement any on-prem computing in this market.  It is interesting that Google is falling off a little.

The [auto industry knows they need to transform into software/chips/battery companies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/06/auto-industry-peers-into-an-electric-future-sees-bumps-ahead/) but they are facing a daunting task as CapEx and R&D from the tech world races past automotive CapEx and R&D.  

As software (and silicon) eats the world, the tech players have a distinct advantage.  I’m long Intel, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, NVidia, Tesla.

## Attention and Intentionality

The [attention economy is damaging us as producers and consumers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/opinion/michael-goldhaber-internet.html).  We squander our time and attention across 1000s of sources, and we squander our productive energy seeking attention. It is the challenge of our time to find a way to fight through this. 

_Hey John, why are you posting this, aren’t you guilty of fighting for attention like everyone else?_  _Hmm, you have a point.  To be clear, I mostly write these articles for myself — I find that I don’t really learn something unless I take the time to reflect and write about it.  But I could just as well stick this in a diary and not share it with the world._ _Hmm._

[Bezos on high standards](https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1356987055482359810?s=20) -- powerful and simple.  And partly explains to me why I bother to publish these thoughts publicly.  If I am writing just for myself, I can be sloppy and imprecise.  Knowing that I am going to share these publicly forces me to be more thoughtful, more precise, more attentive, and I get some feedback on the quality of my thinking.

[Charlie Kindel on how to be a change agent](https://ceklog.kindel.com/2021/02/03/how-to-be-a-secret-agent-of-change/) — this is a nice framework, I have often failed to segment and prioritize the stakeholders and have wasted time and energy on the opposed.  I have not been intentional enough about how to create change. Thank you Charlie.

The entire point of these postings may be -- forcing myself to be more intentional about what I think on and what I learn.

## Political Life

[Ohio Governor DeWine wants $50M to market Ohio as a great progressive place to live](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/01/ohio-gov-mike-dewine-wants-50-million-market-progressive-state/4342873001/).  And apparently the [marketing spend is already happening](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/snow-ridden-ohio-plays-off-seattles-rainy-weather-clever-ad-campaign-attract-jobs/). As many observers point out, this is not really a marketing problem.  If DeWine wants Ohio to be seen as a progressive destination for progressive industries and progressive people, DeWine and the Ohio government actually have to implement progressive policies — where does the state stand on healthcare access, on education funding, on minimum wage and income equality, on equal rights and voting rights?  And Ohio has to elect progressive leaders — Jim Jordan is the most visible political face in the state.  I have great affection for Ohio, and I know there are progressive people and progressive urban areas in the state, but overall the state has work to do.

## Random

[Pickleball is the fastest growing sport in America](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/01/30/pickleball-is-the-fastest-growing-sport-in-america). Don’t forget [ENIAC day](https://eniacday.org/about-us) is coming up. There is a [website dedicated to reporting on Ponzi scheme activities](http://theponzibook.blogspot.com) -- criminality and gullibility are evergreen.
