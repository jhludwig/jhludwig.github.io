\* [HP working on solar PV](http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1727/), IBM putting a [billion dollars into green datacenters](http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1750/), [Intel spinning out a PV firm](http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1750/) -- nice to see the IT leaders getting behind alternate energy \* [DOE funds electric vehicle projects](http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles-get-a-30m-charge-1008.html) -- not sure why GM, GE, Ford need DOE money -- give it to startups! More interesting is the note about Tesla's deal with Daimler, very smart. \* [Nuclear option gets more public support](http://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2008/06/17/nuclear-option-its-not-verboten-anymore/) -- thank goodness. The public is more rational than the politicians about energy strategy \* [Duke Energy jumping into residential and commercial solar installs](http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2008/06/10/duke-plans-100m-investment-solar-energy) -- the wave of the future? \* [Green construction materials](http://greenbuildingelements.com/2008/06/01/rastra-or-durisol-eco-alternatives-for-construction/) -- I wonder about the 50 year life of these. I think I will let others be the beta testers.
