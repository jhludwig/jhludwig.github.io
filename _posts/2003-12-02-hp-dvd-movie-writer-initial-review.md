I've wanted to try this for a while -- [a little ludwig goes a long way: HP DVD Movie Writer](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001046.html "a little ludwig goes a long way: HP DVD Movie Writer again") -- and so finally bought one and tried it out.  
  
Net impression -- I am a little disappointed. This is basically a usb-attached dvd burner with some bundled software. It has a few features to automate the transfer of a vhs tape to dvd -- notably a bundled set of video in ports. But I was under the impression that a PC was hardly needed to transfer VHS tapes to DVD -- the [hp site](http://h30015.www3.hp.com/hp_dec/products/dvd_movie_writer.asp) says _"Transfer your home video to long-lasting DVDs ... all without additional hardware or software."_ and _"Transfer, edit and preserve your home video ? even print DVD case covers ? with one easy-to-use device."_ and _"automatic, unattended conversion of your home movies"_.  
  
Well that is all a little over the top. The device is non-functional without an attached PC driving it. And you have to interact a lot with the "Wizard" to get it to capture your tapes. And I am pretty sure you need at least two other devices -- a pc and a printer -- to print the dvd case covers. The bundled software is the normal set of bundled shlock you will find with a PC or dvd burner these days. Perhaps slightly more automated but the same basic crud.  
  
Now, it did create playable DVDs which is something, this can be hard to do. I didn't create a single coaster. So I guess it got some things right. But nowhere near as automated and trouble-free as implied.
