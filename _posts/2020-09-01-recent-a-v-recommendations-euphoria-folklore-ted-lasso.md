- [Euphoria](https://www.hbo.com/euphoria) is an explosive series. High school like I never experienced, kids struggling with big issues, and I was rooting for them all and blown away by them all. I never expected to like a high school drama, but this is an intense and deep show.
- [Ted Lasso](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy) is funny and touching. Jason Sudeikis plays a lovable, optimistic, vulnerable role that is very endearing.
- [Folklore](https://taylor.lnk.to/folkloredlxWE) by Taylor Swift. I am not generally a huge Taylor fan but this has been the soundtrack of our summer. I love the stripped down presentation.
