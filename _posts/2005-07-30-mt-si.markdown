Went up [Mt Si](http://www.theludwigs.com/images/Hiking/MTSI-072005.JPG) this week -- first time ever. 4 miles one way, I think about 3200' vertical gain. Gorgeous day and gorgeous spot. I think I still like Rattlesnake ledge better but this was beautiful.

Along the way, discovered my hiking boots weren't all they could be. Upgraded to some [asolos](http://www.asolo.com/).
