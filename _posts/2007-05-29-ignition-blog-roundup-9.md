\* [Tong Family Blog: Best Seattle Restaurants](http://www.tongfamily.com/best_seattle_restaurants.php "Tong Family Blog: Best Seattle Restaurants") -- I use [SeattleWeekly](http://www.SeattleWeekly.com) for recos but this is a good list too. Remember when CitySearch nee Sidewalk was actually useful for restaurant reviews? \* Lala's music streaming plans get covered in [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/29/free-legal-on-demand-steaming-music-lala-is-going-to-give-it-a-shot/) \* Phil keeps [knocking out Beyond411 features](http://thebogles.com/blog/2007/05/new-beyond411-release-improving-mobile-web-search-speed-and-privacy/). And the app hasn't bloated! \* Rich offers guidance on [indoor sports photo lenses](http://www.tongfamily.com/photography/equipment/indoor_sports_lenses.php). I was super happy with my setup for lacrosse this spring but I will need to do something for basketball. \* Rich's [guidance on media players](http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/best_media_player.php). VLC has saved my ass as well.
