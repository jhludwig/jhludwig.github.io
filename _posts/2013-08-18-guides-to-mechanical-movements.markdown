[![http://www.flickr.com/photos/wwarby/](images/4782904694_4acae66d7e-300x225.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/4782904694_4acae66d7e.jpg)I just discovered [507 movements](http://507movements.com/), what a great resource! Back in my active Halloween days, I used to spend a lot of time figuring out how to turn simple rotary motion (as available from a myriad cheap motors) into some form of erratic or lateral motion. Or lateral motion (as available from a pneumatic piston) into some other form of motion. I have the 4 volume set of [Ingenious Mechanisms](http://www.amazon.com/Ingenious-Mechanisms-Designers-Inventors-4-Volume/dp/0831110848/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1376840380&sr=8-1&keywords=ingenious+mechanisms), which is even more excellent. But the 507 site is free!
