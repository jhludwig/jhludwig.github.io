I've posted my current projections over at Fanblogs -- [NCAA College Football - Fanblogs.com: Sept 30 BCS Projections](http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/archives/000404.php "NCAA College Football - Fanblogs.com: Sept 30 BCS Projections"). Among the loser's bracket (the single-loss teams), Georgia, USC, WSU, and Michigan are the leaders. I suspect that we will end up with two major unbeatens but if the unbeatens falter, look for these teams to sneak in. One of the crazy things about college football is -- if you must lose, do it early in the season so that the memory fades.
