Great counsel here -- [The Sells Spout](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/#I_speak_for_the_trees "The Sells Spout") -- _The idea is, no matter what projects you work on, no matter what groups you go to, no matter what tasks you're into that day, to have an underlying agenda that pushes you forward and drives your decisions._ Somewhat a corollary of one of my favorite quotes by Socrates -- _An unexamined life is not worth living._
