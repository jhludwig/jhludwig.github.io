**Web Album Generator**. I've blogged this before but I saw another mention of it -- [ornj.net - Web Album Generator](http://www.ornj.net/software/webalbum/index.html) -- I need to try it out this weekend. OK I tried it out. Makes pretty clean pages. But a pain to import photos, and the pages are static so updating will be a pain. Not the right solution.
