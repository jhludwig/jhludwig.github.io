\* [College Football Forum: Florida Jab at OSU #684-#686](http://michiganzone.blogspot.com/2007/04/florida-jab-at-osu-684-686.html "College Football Forum: Florida Jab at OSU #684-#686") -- Florida abuses OSU. OK this is still pretty painful, but funny. The beginnings of true hatred. \* [The ongoing Mustain saga](http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/?p=3327) -- this is why SEC football is awesome.
