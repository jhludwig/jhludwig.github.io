\* [Adrian](http://www.geekfishing.net/2004/12/07/great_wireless_data_site.html) finds a [great wireless blog](http://www.mogalime.com/), and Rich points to a [lot of interesting wireless sites and companies](http://www.tongfamily.com/family/geek/2004/12/09/wireless_interesting_stuff.html). Ignition's original investing focus was wireless data, and while we have broadened a bit, it is obviously still near and dear to our heart. \* [Cloudmark gets good reviews](http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20041206_cloudmark_still_one_of_the_best_antispam_products_for_windows_users.phtml) as the best anti-spam solution -- and they've extended the product to deal with phish as well. \* Martin continues his dive into [all things biodiesel](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2004/12/pennsylvania_pr.html)... \* People talking about [cellphones as the real competitor to the ipod](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000180022895/) -- hence our investment in [Melodeo](http://www.melodeo.com/) \* Rich discusses the [import of the browser share shift to Firefox](http://marketingplaybook.com/2004/12/04/internet_explorer_share_drop.html) -- the movement of influentials is very important...and Rich is playing around with [headphone amps](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/gadgets/2004/12/03/total_bithead.html)
