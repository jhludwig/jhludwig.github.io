Hey [this](http://www.flock.com) feels pretty good. Light and zippy. Blog integration is decent tho a few bugs and shortcomings.  Nice importation of all firefox settings.  I don't think I will stick with it quite yet because of the problems listed below but it is a great attempt.   

- I've come to depend on the IETab firefox plugin and flock doesn't support yet, so that is a major bummer
- The blogging feature doesn't allow me to set category or keywords on an entry so that is a non-starter.  oh wait i guess it does, tho not in the entry editting window but in another window that pops up when you try to publish -- kind of odd
