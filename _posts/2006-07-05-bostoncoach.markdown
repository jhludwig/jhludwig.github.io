[Welcome to BostonCoach](http://www.bostoncoach.com/index.jsp "Welcome to BostonCoach") -- ok this is not the cheapest way to get around, but Buston Coach has been rock-solid for us over the last several years. The service has been flawless -- always arriving on time, always courteous, scheduleable on relatively short notice, works well in major metro areas and more remote areas. We are huge fans.
