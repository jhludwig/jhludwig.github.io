title: "RPI alternatives -- Tessel 2, Spark Electron"

I see I can pre-order a [Tessel 2](https://tessel.io/) now. Interesting part, it is nice that wifi is built in, and they have the same entry price as the pi, and they seem to be more focused on embedded solutions, with a lot of messaging around pricing and use for embedded. But no GPU on this chip which seems unfortunate, unless I am missing something. And no camera port, usb only. This might or might not be ok, tho part of the RPI's appeal is the camera port dumping right to GPU ram with no use of the limited usb/io bus.

The [Spark Electron](https://www.spark.io/) is another interesting device, built in low cost cellular plan, which is very nice. I am compelled to trial one just for that. Now this is a much more compute limited device than the others, but a great idea.
