This month's buildup from [The-Ozone](http://www.go-bucks.com/ "The-Ozone"):_It won't be too much longer before the OSU football team hits the practice field in preparation for the 2003 football campaign. The team reports for fall camp on August 5, and practices begin on August 6. That schedule represents somewhat of a departure from past years. Freshmen used to report three days before the upper classmen, but this year, freshmen will not report early. There will be other changes in fall camp this season as well, many of them mandated by the NCAA. As mandated by the NCAA, the team will practice in helmets and shorts the first two days (Aug. 6-7) and helmets, then in shoulder pads the next two days (Aug. 8-9). The first day of contact is Sunday, Aug. 10. On Monday, Aug. 11, the team will begin a 2-1, 2-1, 2-1 regimen, meaning two practices on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and single sessions on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The same schedule will be in effect the week of Aug. 18. The second practice on Monday, Wednesday and Friday will be open to the media and to the public._
