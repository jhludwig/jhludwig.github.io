One thing I have plenty of is fog. Between my whole yard fog system and my 4-5 point fog systems, i have fog galore.

This year I'd like to do a little more with fog and lighting. [Fog Machine Vortex](http://www.gotfog.com/vortex1-1.html "Fog Machines - Your Guide to using Fog Machines for Halloween") is one idea i may try. Another I am working on is to project a ghostly image onto a dense area of fog -- kind of like [fogscreen](http://www.fogscreen.com) but way cheaper.
