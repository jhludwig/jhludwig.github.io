Martin is always a great read -- [latest diesels in europe](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2006/04/check_out_the_h.html), [audi a8](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2006/04/audi_a8_diesel.html). man I wish these were available here. as he says the citroen is hot looking.

Also a link to some of the discussions around energy balances of [biofuels](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2006/04/all_in_one_etha.html)
