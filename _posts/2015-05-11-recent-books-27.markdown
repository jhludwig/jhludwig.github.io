- [The Goblin Emperor](http://www.amazon.com/Goblin-Emperor-Katherine-Addison/dp/0765365685) by Katherine Addison. From last year's Nebula list, a great tale of court entrigue.
- [The Ocean at The End of The Lane](http://www.amazon.com/Ocean-End-Lane-Novel/dp/0062255665) by Neil Gaiman. A pretty quick read, very entrancing. Worth the accolades.
- [Ancillary Justice](http://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Justice-Imperial-Radch-Leckie/dp/031624662X) and [Ancillary Sword](http://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Sword-Imperial-Radch-Leckie/dp/0316246654) by Ann Leckie. Also from last year's Nebula list, a galaxy-spanning human empire starts to crumble from the inside.
- [Thinking Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) by Daniel Kahneman. Good but a big of a slog.
- [Dead Wake](http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Wake-Last-Crossing-Lusitania/dp/0307408868) by Erik Larson. A great telling of the last days of the Lusitania. Immediately bought another Larson, this was great.
- [City of Bohane](http://www.amazon.com/City-Bohane-Novel-Kevin-Barry/dp/155597645X) by Kevin Barry. A strange tale of near future Ireland. Men are fools.
- [The Child Who](http://www.amazon.com/Child-Who-Novel-Simon-Lelic/dp/0143120913) by Simon Lelic. A lawyer nobly tries to defend a young murder suspect and finds his own life torn apart. Don't try experiments on your family.
