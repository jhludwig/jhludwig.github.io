Struggling with a blackberry problem right now -- won't sync correctly with Outlook 2003 -- a search on error #4198 at the [BlackBerry support forums](http://www.blackberry.net/cgi-bin/htsearch "BlackBerry") reveals that I am not alone. How long has Outlook 2003 been out now? Surprising to me that the bberry dudes have no fix for.
