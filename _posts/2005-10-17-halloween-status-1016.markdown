On the good side -- most props deployed, all foggers working, all lighting deployed. 

Yet to be done -- test DMX control, finish pneuma prop deployment.

On the bad side -- blew a [Dove Dimmer](http://www.dovesystems.com/index.php?page=shop.flypage&product_id=26&category_id=&option=com_phpshop).  Water and electricity are not friends.  I am hoping that maybe just a fuse blew in it, but it was a pretty dramatic blow.  I wish there were some outdoor friendly dimmer products.
