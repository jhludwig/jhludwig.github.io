\* Love the new customizable Google news -- [my customized page is here](http://news.google.com/news?ned=:ePkh8BM9g5tXArcDbFs5xA5xLWH_jMx8heCSxJJUBafS5OzUytRiAxYhYS1Bz_S8zJLM_DyFgMSikrzUomKYOwCsABQ0) (so that I can use it on all my machines). This page is good enough for me to add to my set of startup pages in Firefox. \* got my [free annual credit report](www.annualcreditreport.com). Nothing shocking here, thank goodness. \* [Great list of CMSs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems) up on Wikipedia -- thanks [gadgetopia](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/03/03/CMSList.html) \* [Streamload](http://www.streamload.com/Account/Pricing.asp) has a range of online storage plans -- some of them very cheap -- I wonder if I should start backing up everything up there. \* The [entire SXSW music program as a torrent](http://player.sxsw.com/SXSW_2005_Showcasing_Artist_mp3s.torrent).
