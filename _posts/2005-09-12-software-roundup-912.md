\* [64bit windows perf testing](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1857476,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532) -- as i buy a new machine, looks like i should stick to 32-bit windows for now. not because of perf issues, but because of driver and sw compat issues with 64-bit. \* [Frankston on the confusion between features and protocols/media](http://www.satn.org/archive/2005_09_04_archive.html#112640729750878314) -- good stuff -- why we need bluetooth, wifi, and wireless usb is beyond me. would have been great if they had all agreed at least on a link-level protocol so that they could all play nicely. But I admit I've been guilty of this mistake in the past -- inventing new protocols when all we needed was some feature work layered on existing solutions. Seems like the marketplace eventually shakes this stuff out for the most part. \* [Furrygoat on foldershare](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/09/thoughts.html) -- i think the folder sync feature is going to be a feature that shows up in a hundred products. I don't think it will last as a separate business. That said, simple folder syncing is a real need -- [lots of people love foldershare.](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OverwhelmedAndEnamoredWithFolderShare.aspx) (Another related solution to check out is [the recently announced ibm continuous backup product](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/swnews/swnews.nsf/n/lsan6flnnt?OpenDocument&Site=tivoli) -- different solution but does achieve one of the goals, backup) (oh and [larry likes his mirra](http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/09/07/462032.aspx)) \* [Ed Bott's recommended software list.](http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=584) Good stuff. \* [Larkware on Omea Pro](http://www.larkware.com/dg4/TheDailyGrind705.html) -- I was initially intrigued but it feels heavyweight to me. I want something simpler than outlook, not something equally complicated. \* [A better attachment viewer for the bberry](http://blackberryblog.com/2005/09/04/repligo_professional_for_blackberry.html) -- bberry attachment viewing is pretty bad, this looks nice. \* [Scott provides a bunch of AJAX links](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheComingReturnOfAJAX.aspx), good place to start reading.
