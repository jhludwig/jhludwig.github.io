**Activewords**. An interesting idea, I could use system-wide macros -- [ActiveWords Home Page](http://www.activewords.com/). But I had to uninstall, it seemed a little too aggressive at capturing keystrokes, there were times when i couldn't seem to type anything into any program, Activewords was eating everything. Too bad.
