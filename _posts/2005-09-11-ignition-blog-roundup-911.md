\* [Adrian is trying out EDGE](http://www.geekfishing.net//2005/09/07/edge_phone_as_a_modem.html) for wireless connections. Sounds good. I am tired of futzing around with crappy public wifi access points. Couple it with a [box like this](http://www.junxionbox.com/) and you can run your own hotspot where you need it. \* Brad in a thread on [.net and vcs](http://www.beyondvc.com/2005/07/net_and_vc_loya.html) from this summer. Like he says, we're agnostic. We can't afford to be technology bigots. \* [Martin points out that biodiesel is now cheaper here than regular diesel](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/09/price_inversion.html). Exciting times for energy investors. \* I'm a sucker for [optical illusions -- nice one](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/optical-illusion/) from phil. \* Rich is [in love with a9 maps](http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/09/02/a9_maps.html) and misquotes me. I think what I was really trying to say is Google is finally figuring out how to be sticky. They are providing a platform now that hundreds of apps are using. As they expand and get thousands of apps to use their underlying service, well that will be quite an asset. \* People inside Microsoft [took note of the aggressive recruiting](http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/09/three-quick-things-jobs-dynamics.html) that our friends at [Judy's Book](http://www.judysbook.com) and [Mpire](http://www.mpire.com) co-sponsored. Nice work guys! \* Phil keeps cranking on his blackberry app -- [find jobs](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/08/find-your-dream-job-on-your-cellphone.html) on your phone, and [his app will be featured in an upcoming bberry hacks book.](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/08/oreillys-blackberry-hacks-coming-this.html) Nice.
