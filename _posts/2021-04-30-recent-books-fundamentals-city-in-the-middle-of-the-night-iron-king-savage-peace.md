- [Fundamentals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54649857-fundamentals) by Frank Wilczek. An easy read about the fundamental particles, forces, fields that make up the universe. All very simple at one level, though allows obviously for a massive amount of emergent complexity.
- [The City in the Middle of the Night](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40815235-the-city-in-the-middle-of-the-night) by Charlie Jane Anders. Eh, a little bit inventive situation, but characters all seemed a little thin. Ultimately I didn't care enough to finish.
- [Suspicion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19438339-suspicion) by Joseph Finder. A formulaic thriller but fast paced enough to be entertaining.
- [The Iron King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17566864-the-iron-king) by Maurice Druon. Described by George R. R. Martin as the inspiration for A Game of Thrones, it certainly has intrigue and gamesmanship and betrayal, tho lacks the modern style and pacing of A Game of Thrones. But still fun.
- [Savage Peace](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6361306-savage-peace) by Ann Hagedorn. I had just the barest understanding of the events of 1919. Man was that year an eventful sh$tshow. Labor unrest, racial injustice, xenophobia, political drama. Oh and the first experimental proof of relativitistic behavior of gravity.
