I started taking graduate matsci courses several years ago at the UW via the [Edge program](http://www.engr.washington.edu/edge/), and also took some on campus. I have found it hard to continue though as the UW materials science school doesn't have a deep schedule, and they have decommitted from the distance learning effort. So I am shopping for other programs.

Columbia's program -- [CVN - Columbia Video Network](http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/) -- seems to be among the most complete with a full schedule of courses. And they offer a full MS degree via online. And you can start as a non-matriculated student. [Florida](http://www.distancelearning.ufl.edu/program.aspx?p=29) has a program as well. And so does [USC](http://den.usc.edu/programs/index.htm), tho the courses offered is a smaller slate than Columbia's.
