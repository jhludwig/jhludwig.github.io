I really like this observation -- [Brand Autopsy: A Vital Jack Welch Quote](http://brandautopsy.typepad.com/brandautopsy/2007/03/a_vital_jack_we.html "Brand Autopsy: A Vital Jack Welch Quote")

“Too often we measure everything and understand nothing. The three most important things you need to measure in a business are customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and cash flow. If you’re growing customer satisfaction, your global market share is sure to grow, too. Employee satisfaction gets you productivity, quality, pride, and creativity. And cash flow is the pulse—the key vital sign of a company.”
