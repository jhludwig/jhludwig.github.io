**The World's View of America**. This looks like an interesting read -- [Granta: Granta 77: What We Think of America](http://www.granta.com/back-issues/77?usca_p=t). What I'd really love to find tho is a collection of high school history/social studies text books from around the world. I'd love to see exactly what is being taught in other countries to their kids. I know there is a lot of bias in what I was taught.
