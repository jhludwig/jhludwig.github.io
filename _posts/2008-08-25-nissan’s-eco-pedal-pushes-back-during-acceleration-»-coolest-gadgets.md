[Nissan’s ECO Pedal pushes back during acceleration » Coolest Gadgets](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080805/nissans-eco-pedal-pushes-back-during-acceleration/).  Love the idea of embedding behaviour into everyday objects.  I want my light switches to give me feedback about energy consumption.  My wallet to give me feedback about my spending.
