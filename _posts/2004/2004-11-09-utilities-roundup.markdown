Since I can't play Halo2 today, trying out other software:

\* from [Gadgetopia](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/11/02/EditPlus.html) I found [Editplus](http://www.editplus.com). Love the integrated FTP support. \* [Firefox 1.0 release](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=8817) -- [irresponsibly](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/003688.html?wbfrom=rss) upgrading all machines now... \* [Furrygoat points](http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=686a7305-a1d1-4c15-b191-55fa4f084d25 ) to the [MSFT error code lookup tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=be596899-7bb8-4208-b7fc-09e02a13696c&displaylang=en) -- as he says despite the title this tool works for all windows error codes. \* [Marc points](http://blogs.officezealot.com/marc/archive/2004/10/31/3238.aspx ) to a new version of [Clipmate](http://www.thornsoft.com/clipmate6.htm). Ok I didn't really try this one, just posted here because it reminded me of WFW and the mods we did to the clipboard to support network sharing of clipboard items -- boy was that a waste of time. \* [Turborisk](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/10/30/TurboRisk.html) -- a free classic. OK the opponents are braindead but it is free. \* [Photostory 3](http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=07ab2f23-583c-4b84-af25-98b720ffcb25 ). Free. Haven't tried yet but intend to... \* [Udell talks about MSH](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/02.html#a1106) -- this looks pretty cool. I waded thru the beta signup process and have my key so I can try later today.

And I'll close on a good general point raised at [Microsoft Monitor](http://www.microsoftmonitor.com/archives/004060.html) -- _There is no reason why back-up capabilities shouldn't be built into digital content software, even if consumers don't immediately use the function._
