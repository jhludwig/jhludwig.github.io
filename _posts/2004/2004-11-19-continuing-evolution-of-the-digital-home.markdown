\* Via [Furrygoat](http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7ee9b099-0102-4e07-984e-058220045595 ), a MAME emulator for MCE. Seems like MCE could become an interesting platform. \* A review of [BeyondTV](http://www.tvharmony.com/blog/archives/2004/11/review_beyondtv.html) in case MCE isn't your cup of tea. My bet is every home ends up with a PC next to their TV. \* [Siemens sell Skype adapter for their cordless handsets](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/11/2338200). Once consumers can use mainstream handsets for VOIP calling, this market will explode. \* [Another way to bridge VOIP and mainstream handsets.](http://rasterweb.net/raster/200411.html#11032004124837)
