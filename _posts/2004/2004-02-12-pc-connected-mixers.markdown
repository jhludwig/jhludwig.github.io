Looking at PC-connected mixers as a way to augment my KVM based on [a suggestion from a reader](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001325.html). [Hercules DJ Console USB DJ/Audio Interface for PC](http://www.americanmusical.com/item--i-KAY-DJCONSOLE.html "Hercules DJ Console USB DJ/Audio Interface for PC") -- this will let me mix the output from one PC (acting as a usb sound card) with (it looks like) an spdif output from another pc. I can't totally tell from the specs but software like [PCDJ](http://www.pcdj.com/Products/FX.asp) may do this all in software -- route the audio output from one pc to the capture interface of the other, and then mix on the pc. Of course at a CPU load cost. I am sure some of [these other mixers](http://www.pssl.com/asearchresults.tpl?UID=%5BUID%5D&waGroup1datarq=mixer&str_Categorydatarq=ALL&new_Submit.x=21&new_Submit.y=14) have some remote interface tho it is hard to sort thru them all.
