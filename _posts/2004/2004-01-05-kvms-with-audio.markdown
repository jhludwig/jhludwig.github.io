I'm trying to find a good KVM with Audio for home use. I've started with this -- [Belkin OmniView SOHO Series KVM Switch with Audio, USB and VGA](http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&Section_Id=201729&pcount=&Product_Id=160623 "Welcome to Belkin - OmniViewâ„¢ SOHO Series KVM Switch with Audio, USB and VGA") -- and while it works largely as promised, it has some real drawbacks. The video and audio switching are fine. But the keyboard/mouse/usb switching is troubled -- the box is basically a USB 1.x hub which is switched back and forth between machines. And this creates some problems.

- it is usb 1.x and not usb 2.0 which creates all kinds of annoying error messages because I have downstream usb 2.0 devices.
- the usb hub introduces latency in kb/mouse interactions which is at time noticeable in games.
- the hub just plain drops some kb input -- for instance if you hold down the control key for more than 5 seconds, the hub forgets. really bad if you are trying to select a lot of messages in your inbox for instance.

So i can't recommend this box. I may try the PS2 model and see if it improves the latency and keyboard problems -- it may since i think the ps2 switching is just an electrical switching and doesn't try to get fancy with a usb hub. What I'd really like tho is a usb2.0 based kvm with low latency and no keyboard drops. Google points toward some [usb2.0 kvms](http://www.google.com/search?q=usb+2.0+kvm) but they don't have audio. Maybe i should just get one of these kvms and have a separate switch for audio?
