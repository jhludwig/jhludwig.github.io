\* Wired article about [the long, profitable tail of publishing](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html). Not shocking perhaps but a good read. \* [Buy your place in a novel](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/10/markets_in_ever_5.html). $150 currently. \* Ross Mayfield on [productivity and value shift](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/productivity_an.html) -- _This is accelerated commoditization, where value shifts to people; and managing risk and complexity._
