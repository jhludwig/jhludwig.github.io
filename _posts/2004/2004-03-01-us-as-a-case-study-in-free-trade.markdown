[Economic Scene: U.S. Is a Case Study in Free Trade](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/26/business/26scene.html?ex=1393218000&en=98206e0e14b548d8&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND "Economic Scene: U.S. Is a Case Study in Free Trade") -- interesting article. Basically says that we have had free trade within the US for a century+, and that the primary effect has been to pull the income levels of the poorer regions up. The richer regions have not suffered significantly. And that we can draw a lesson from this as we consider globalization.
