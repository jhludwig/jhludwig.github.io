[Senators are really good at stock-picking](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/15/89754.aspx "Senators are really good at stock-picking") -- nice find from Raymond Chen. As the comments point out, the causality here is not totally clear. Though a strong suggestion that Senators benefit from their position.

Now I thought that Presidents put all their assets into trust when they were elected -- should not US Senators do the same?
