[Oryx and Crake](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385721676/qid=1083544274/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-1182139-8900015) reminded me very much of Gore Vidal's [Kalki (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0141180374/qid=1083544221/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-1182139-8900015?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Kalki (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)") which I read back in the 70s when it was published. Both have a very haunting view of humanity decimated by a genius who thinks he has a better plan for the world. Both extremely sad, Kalki will probably stick with me better perhaps because I read it first. But O&C was a good read too; had I not encountered Kalki, I would have considered O&C one of the best apocalyptic stories around. I don't really think we are on the path to the dystopia described in O&C but a good read.
