[The Lexus and the Olive Tree](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385499345/qid=1084736062/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-6145252-2100164?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) -- I've had this on the shelf for a couple years and never cracked because I expected to hate it, I thought it was going to be some anti-globalization rant, or just another "pop business" book. Actually tho it was a lot better than expected, a very clear articulation of why globalization will happen and discussions of implications and how we should react. Too long of course like every non-fiction book.

And then just for waiting room reading I worked thru Ben Bova's [Saturn](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312872186/qid=1084736208/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-6145252-2100164?v=glance&s=books). Very forgettable sci-fi. Won't actually harm your brain reading it but no substance -- I finished it yesterday and I couldn't tell you today the names of any of the characters.
