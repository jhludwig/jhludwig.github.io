I wanted to add Google as an information source for the Research feature in Outlook (Office) 2003 but geez look at these directions -- [Google Sample (Microsoft Office 2003 Research Service Software Development Kit)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/rssdk/html/rsSamplesGoogle.asp?frame=true "Google Sample (Microsoft Office 2003 Research Service Software Development Kit)") -- install sdks, on servers, or enable IIS on your machine, ...

What a pain in the a$$. Not worth it. If someone has a simpler way let me know.
