[Paul Thurrott's Internet Nexus](http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_09_12_archive.htm#109511686049665606 "Paul Thurrott's Internet Nexus") -- "Tunebite supports customer to hear their music everywhere they want. Did you purchase your music online and do you find it frustrating that you can?t listen to it wherever you want to? Tunebite is fully automated to free you from this annoyance when you listen to music. With Tunebite you can listen to your music everywhere from now on, even on your MP3 player. Legal & foolproof: Tunebite runs in the background on your Windows PC. When you play back a piece of music, Tunebite automatically re-records the song. This is legal and foolproof." Awesome.
