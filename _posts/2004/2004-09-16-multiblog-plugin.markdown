OK based on this reco -- [Movalog: Merging your blogs](http://www.movalog.com/archives/templates/index/merging-your-blogs.php "Movalog: Merging your blogs") -- i installed multiblog last nite. actually went on kind of a plugin install rampage. the install of multiblog and getxml were so easy i decided to try out some more from the [mt3 tested library](http://mt-plugins.org/3test.php). i've slowed down tho, as the install of [typemover](http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/typemover.php) hasn't worked quite so well -- some path problems.
