From [Life of a one-man IT department](http://www.mikemcbrideonline.com/2004_09_19_archives.html#109603053926987434 "Life of a one-man IT department"), a pointer to RSS Digest, a nice way to integrate xml feeds on your page.

One man's [password algorithm](http://channels.lockergnome.com/net/archives/20040811_remembering_passwords.phtml) -- I use a variant of this and it seems to work pretty well.

[Flexwiki open sourced](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1657278,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594) -- I like Flexwiki, using it for some private Wikis, a lot nicer visual look than some of the other wiki tools I played with.

From [Geekman](http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Netcool.html), the [List of Lists](http://lists.gpick.com/) -- nice guide to utilities.

Rich likes [Maxthon](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/2004/09/26/mathon_is_great.html), I suppose I should try tho I am getting software install fatigue -- too many machines on which I have to manage the software footprint.
