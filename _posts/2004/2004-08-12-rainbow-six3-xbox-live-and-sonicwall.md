Trying to work around the XBOX Live "you have a strict nat" problem. The XBOX team has [classified NATs into three categories](http://www.xbox.com/en-nz/live/start/connect/router/NAT.htm) and apparently our Sonicwall is strict, which is bad. The xbox site is pretty quiet about what to do about this tho.

[Ubisoft is just as useless](http://ubisoft.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/ubisoft.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=pk1MPMih&p_lva=&p_faqid=9931&p_created=1092070155&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9ncmlkc29ydD0mcF9yb3dfY250PTEmcF9zZWFyY2hfdGV4dD1uYXQmcF9zZWFyY2hfdHlwZT0zJnBfcHJvZF9sdmwxPTE5NiZwX3Byb2RfbHZsMj0xMTI0JnBfY2F0X2x2bDE9fmFueX4mcF9zb3J0X2J5PWRmbHQmcF9wYWdlPTE*&p_li=).

Sonicwall has some disastrous AI-driven [KnowledgePortal](http://www.sonicwall.com/services/support.html) -- someone was taking painkillers when they approved this project.

Netgear has some info that we are going to try -- [Port Numbers for Port Forwarding](http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n100495.asp "Port Numbers for Port Forwarding"). We'll see how that works.
