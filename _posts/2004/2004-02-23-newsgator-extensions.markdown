The extension feature of newsgator2.0 is very cool -- i just installed Fetchlinks which [Greg Reinacker pointed out](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=705 "Greg Reinacker's Weblog - NewsGator extensions"), I've wanted this for a while. I'm going to pass on the [calendar extension](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=706) tho -- i protect my time carefully and i do not want random events flying onto my calendar.
