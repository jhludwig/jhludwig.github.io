Some great posts I've found on the disaggregation of the PC in the home -- we aren't moving to bigger and bigger PCs in the home, but to elements of the computing environment spread all around:

\* [Furrygoat summary](http://www.furrygoat.com/2004/12/the_exploding_p.html) and [his external storage box](http://www.furrygoat.com/2004/12/asus_wlan_hard_.html). His main point is all about pulling storage out of individual PCs and making it a household-wide resource. \* From [decafbad](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/13/miscellaneous_thoughts_about_exploded_pcs), these [gumstix](http://www.gumstix.com) are very cool concepts, it would be nice if assembling computing at home was as easy as throwing a couple of these together. \* A [more general post from decafbad](http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/13/on_exploding_pcs_and_appliance_relationships) about single purpose devices in the home.

All the most aggressive users of technology I talk to are moving to disaggregation of storage in the home, despite the current designs of pcs which generally don't encourage this disaggregation.
