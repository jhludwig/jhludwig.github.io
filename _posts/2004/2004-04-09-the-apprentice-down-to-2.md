[NBC.com -- The Apprentice](http://www.nbc.com/The_Apprentice/ "NBC.com - The Apprentice") -- OK can Omarosa really be as obviously duplicitous as she seems to be? I almost have to believe that she is playing a role and that her part is scripted, no one can be this pathological. She reminds me of the old Jon Lovitz pathological liar character.
