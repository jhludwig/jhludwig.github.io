[The Occupational Adventure (sm) Blog: Goal people and river people](http://curtrosengren.typepad.com/occupationaladventure/2004/01/goal_people_and.html "The Occupational Adventure (sm) Blog: Goal people and river people") -- good article. I think I am mostly a river person but with occasional bouts of goalishness. Found via [Rebecca's Blog](http://radio.weblogs.com/0126638/2004/01/06.html#a507).
