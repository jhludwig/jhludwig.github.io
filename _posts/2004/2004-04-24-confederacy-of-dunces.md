[A Confederacy of Dunces](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802130208/qid=1082873989/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/102-5508966-4456113?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: A Confederacy of Dunces") has been sitting on the shelf for 5 years, I finally read it. As all the reviewers note, this book is absolutely hilarious. Ignatius is an amazing character, I was left wanting more -- I've been unwilling to start another book because I want to keep the characters fresh in my mind. I thought the ending was a little anticlimactic but how would you end this spiral of chaos?

Is [the movie](http://www.google.com/search?q=confederacy+dunces+movie) really getting made? Will Ferrell would be awesome in the role but after a flurry of news last year, all the movie sites seem silent about the movie.
