\* [Despair Inc](http://www.despair.com). OK I can't imagine ever actually ordering any of these posters but they do crack me up. \* The [Air Force Pain Beam](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/air-force-takes-pain-beam-to-the-skies-025754.php). OK I am not sure why I find this funny, says something sad about me. \* [Danny reminds me of the Paul is Dead mania](http://www.livejournal.com/users/dglasser/22278.html). \* [Room Defender Sentry Turret](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/room-defender-sentry-turret-025302.php). Man I would have loved one of these as a kid.

My sense of humour is pretty dark and aggressive this week.
