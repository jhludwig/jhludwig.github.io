Here's the stuff I noted out of the flood of coverage:

\* [John Battelle's Searchblog: The Incubation Platform](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000642.php "John Battelle's Searchblog: The Incubation Platform") -- i think a TON of isvs would love to be able to store user state data in the google store and get the benefits of ubiquitous availability, reliability, etc. \* [Speculation on how google will spend all their capital dollars](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000640.php) in '04. Not very deep but an interesting question to ask. \* [Mitch Kapor's view](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000593.html) on the filing. Personally I find the dual-class structure a little worrying, I doubt I will put money in. \* [Surprising fact](http://www.sjl.us/main/2004/04/google_pagerank.html) about Google's license to the pagerank algorithm. \* a list of [google-watching blogs](http://www.investors.com/breakingnews.asp?journalid=20976716&brk=1).
