I've started to eliminate MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger clients from all my machines. Motivated to do so by a couple problems:

\* too aggressive toast behaviour, when I am playing a directx game i don't want any toast thank you. (AIM has this problem too). \* poor idle detection. people were sending me messages when i was not at my machine. \* wrong strategy for presence detection. messages were going to the wrong machine (I use 4 at work and 5 at home regularly) and i would see messages days after they arrived. AIM has this right, they don't try to figure out presence, they just MIRV the message to all your signed-in locations.

If you want to IM me, i'm jhludwig on AIM.
