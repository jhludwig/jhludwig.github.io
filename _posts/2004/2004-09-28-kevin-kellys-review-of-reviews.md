I've read [Kevin Kelly -- Cool Tools](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000549.php "Kevin Kelly -- Cool Tools") regularly and this latest article summarizing and grading review sites is good -- I like the lighting related sites. Thanks to [Martin](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/) for reminding me of this site.
