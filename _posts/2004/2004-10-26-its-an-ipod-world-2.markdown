\* [Photo iPod launched](http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/) -- my order is in \* [The Bose Sounddock](http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_PRODUCT_PAGE_EVENT&product=nfb_sounddock&src=SOUNDDOCK) -- cool looking.

It is fascinating to watch Apple and Microsoft hollow out the consumer electronics industry. Apple building from the iPod base, gradually wiping out all the other audio (and video) products in the home and car. Microsoft starting from the WinXP Media Center edition, wiping out all the other home video and audio products. Then you have the content owners using DRM to force their proprietary decoder hardware into the home. A fascinating collision of giants. As much as I love Apple's products -- how is their strategy any different than the Mac strategy vs PCs, and how did that work out for Apple?
