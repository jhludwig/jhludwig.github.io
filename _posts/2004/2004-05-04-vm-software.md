Tong just gave me a copy of [MSFT's Virtual PC](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/virtualpc/) -- $10 at the company store, what the heck. But kind of hilarious, the box and website are in denial about Linux -- there is no mention of Linux as a guest OS -- even tho they proudly mention their support for MSDOS and OS/2 Warp.

[VMware](https://www.vmware.com/request_processor?nextPage=/vmwarestore/newstore/category.jsp&action=CATALOG.GETGROUPS&application=store&ProductGroupCodes=WKST4-WIN,WKST4-LX "VMware Store") meanwhile is $189 (that price needs to come down!) and has clear support for linux as host or guest.
