From [Paul Thurott](http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_10_24_archive.htm#109873166815631931), the Firefox marketing team is aiming for 10% share: _Bart Decrem, the marketing contact for the Mozilla Foundation, told ZDNet UK on Friday that he expects the browser's market share to reach 10 percent by the end of 2005. "I think we'll get to 10 percent over the next year. We don't have 10 percent of the Web at the moment, but we have the momentum," claimed Decrem._

C'mon guys, get aggressive! Strike while the iron is hot. You should strive to get to 30% over the next year. If you don't set an aggressive goal, you won't get great results.
