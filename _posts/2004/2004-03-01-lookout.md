I've seen several pointers to [Lookout email search for Microsoft Outlook - Lookout Software](http://www.lookoutsoft.com/ "Lookout email search for Microsoft Outlook - Lookout Software"), most recently from [Marc's Outlook on Productivity](http://blogs.officezealot.com/marc/). I'm mostly interested to see if it will help me navigate thru the thousands of RSS feed items I gather each week thru Newsgator -- I need a faster way to separate the wheat from the chaff. I'm impressed with the team's responsiveness -- I reported a minor bug this morning and they responded right away.
