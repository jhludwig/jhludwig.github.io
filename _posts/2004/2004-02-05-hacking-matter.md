I wanted badly to like [Hacking Matter: Levitating Chairs, Quantum Mirages, and the Infinite Weirdness of Programmable Atoms](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/046504428X/qid=1076006796//ref=pd_ka_1/103-0367784-4631803?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Hacking Matter: Levitating Chairs, Quantum Mirages, and the Infinite Weirdness of Programmable Atoms") but it put me to sleep, I couldn't finish it. Too much dragging thru the details of shoving electrons around. Not enough of the human side of the story -- the scientists on the frontier and what drives them, the future implications for our lives, the unbelievers in the scientific community and the conflict between them and the advocates. There were hints of this but just not enough.
