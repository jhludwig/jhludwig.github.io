[Rich](http://www.tongfamily.com) recommends [PHPEdit](http://www.waterproof.fr/). [Phil](http://philbogle.blogspot.com/) uses [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), [pythonwin](http://www.python.org/windows/pythonwin/), emacs, and sometimes [dreamweaver mx](http://http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/). I know lots of people used to use [slickedit](http://www.slickedit.com/). Sam likes [source insight](http://www.sourceinsight.com/index.html).

Most of these are overkill for me, I just need lightweight html, xml, perl, php editing. Maybe rich is right with phpedit. tho i love all the support around eclipse.
