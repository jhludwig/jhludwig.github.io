[More Twists and Turns on the Road to Longhorn](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,1565118,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535 "More Twists and Turns on the Road to Longhorn") -- _One alleged e-mail from a senior Microsoft Windows executive, dated March 4, claims the company has decided to curtail its Windows file-storage system (WinFS) plans by allowing the file system to work on individual PCs with Longhorn client, but holding off on allowing WinFS to work over a corporate network until a later Windows release._

hmm, this seems unfortunate. it is not clear to me i want a lot of storage innovation on the client, that just seems to lead to more stateful clients, i've been trying to extract locked up state from my clients for years. i want more storage in the cloud, available and usable from any client machine i happen to be at.
