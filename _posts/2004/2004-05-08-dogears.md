Just going thru the dogeared pages on the pile of old mags on my desk...

\* Ceramic knives, for instance the [Kyoceras](http://www.kyoceratycom.com/Fineceramics/Products/index.htm). \* wall warts -- great at halloween for easy conversion of AC to DC -- [Jameco](www.jameco.com) sells them cheaply in a variety of capacities. \* [Rainlender](http://www.ipi.fi/~rainy/index.php?pn=projects&project=rainlendar) -- good looking desktop calendar. \* quiet cooling, i need this for my next pcs, my office right now is a wind tunnel. Incredibly expensive [Zalman cases](http://www.zalman.co.kr/), [water cooling systems by Innovatek](http://www.highspeedpc.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=HSPC&Product_Code=H2OKitxxs&Category_Code=Kits). \* [Exact Audio Copy](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/). Next time I rip, this is the way to go. And i need the Lame Encoder to go with it.
