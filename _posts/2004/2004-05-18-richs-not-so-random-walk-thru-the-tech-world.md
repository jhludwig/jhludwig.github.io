Great recent posts from [Rich](http://www.tongfamily.com/):

- [Cleaning up Nvidia driver problems Part I](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/001546.html) and [Part II](http://www.tongfamily.com//001547.html).  Sadly if you want to live on the bleeding edge of video cards, you need to learn way too much about maintaining the drivers.
- [Anandtech system guides](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/001548.html) -- the low end is a bit too low end for my uses but a great site and service
- [Dual core chips](http://www.geekfishing.net/archives/000991.php) -- basically no one has any idea what to do with all the gates provided by Moore's Law so we might as well start stacking up multiple CPUs on the chip. 
- [MT to Wordpress Migration tips](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_blogs/001550.html) and [more flailing away on SixApart](http://marketingplaybook.com/examples_drag_race/000994.html).
