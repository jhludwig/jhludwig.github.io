[Dark Voyage : A Novel](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400060184/qid=1094932833/sr=8-1/ref=pd_cps_1/102-0227070-6184153?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Dark Voyage : A Novel") by Alan Furst is a moody little corner of wwII, where the nazis aren't so evil, the allies aren't so allied, and there are a whole host of nations in between (spain, portugal, finland, sweden, switzerland, ireland, ...) who are playing their own games. A lot richer in mood and hero character than many wwii spy/adventure stories.
