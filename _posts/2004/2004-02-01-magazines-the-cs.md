Continuing this year's magazine reading adventure, my next two reads:

[Coastal Living](http://www.coastalliving.com/coastal/ "Coastal Living: Home") -- at its best, this is a nice walkthru of design ideas for waterfront homes. If I was building such a home, I'd buy this mag and peruse it for ideas. At its worst, the magazine seems typical of a magazine created by an industry trying to flog its wares -- the magazine is all about encouraging you to buy more stuff, to feel bad about the stuff you have. There were some beautiful places featured in the mag -- [Casa Morada](http://www.casamorada.com/) in the Keys, [Shorepine Village](http://www.shorepinevillage.com/) in Oregon. Oh and I never knew Ho[bie Cats](http://www.hobiecat.com/) were named after a guy named Hobie.

[Conservation in Practice](http://www.conbio.org/InPractice/) -- A very pragmatic magazine about conservation. No extremism here -- just practical articles on small realistic steps in conservation. An interesting article on [Virtual Ecosystems](http://www.conbio.org/InPractice/article44VIR.cfm) -- I guess I'd call this computational ecology. Another article on distributing risk -- creating multiple independent habitats for endangered species. Good guide to wise seafood eating at [Blue Ocean Institute.\[PDF\]](http://www.blueoceaninstitute.org/miniguide.pdf)
