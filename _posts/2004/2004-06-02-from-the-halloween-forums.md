- [Great projects up at ImaginEERIEing.](http://homepage.mac.com/nephilim/imagineerieing/)  The Magic Mirror is awesome, Rich I may have to borrow the office Mac to build this (the software is Mac only).
- [Halloween software](http://www.boopack.com/) -- a number of items up here to help you layout and build props -- linkage simulators, etc.  I've blogged this before but still a good one.
- [This rotating room prop](http://www.hauntedillinois.com/spinfloor.php) is a cool idea.  More work than I want to do this year but maybe someday...
- [This expanding foam](http://www.dow.com/greatstuff/products/) is great for prop construction
- Mounting pneumatic cylinders -- one person's notes: _I have purchased a number of rod clevis (RC-xx81) and clevis brackets (CB-xx95) from_ [_clippard.com_](http://clippard.com/)_. I have also purchased a number of rod clevis and clevis brackets from_ [_grainger.com_](http://grainger.com/)_._
- Molding supplies at [FXSupplies](http://www.fxsupplies.com/) and [Monsterclub](http://www.monsterclub.com/)
