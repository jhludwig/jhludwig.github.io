Just ordered [The Creation of the Media](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465081932/qid=1086117258/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-7149052-8082546?v=glance&s=books). Found it on [Freedom to Tinker](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000615.html "Freedom to Tinker: The Creation of the Media") along with this pithy observation:

_In his limited space, Fallows leaves out one pattern noted by Starr that carries obvious lessons for us. When U.S. policy was at its best, it refused to give the titans of one technology control over the next technology that came along. For example, the Post Office was not given control of the telegraph; Western Union did not control the telephone; and AT&T was locked out of radio. The lessons for us now, when the masters of old technologies, such as the movies and recorded music, want to control Internet technologies, should be obvious._
