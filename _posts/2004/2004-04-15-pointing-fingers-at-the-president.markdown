Hear hear -- [BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_04_15.html#006843 "BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis") -- _No, when and if government employees find a threat against America, they should go and with dispatch stomp it out. The last thing we need is for them to have to go meet with the President. They are and should be empowered by the law to take action._

Not just government employees -- it is the job of every citizen to fight for our rights, to build the economy, to defend our country, etc. None of us should sit back and wait for the government to fix every problem out there.
