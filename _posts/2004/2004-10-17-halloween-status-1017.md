Great progress this weekend -- huge help from my dad who was visiting.

All sound systems deployed and tested. All props deployed. Most lights deployed. Pneumatic cable routed. Fog cabling deployed.

The huge outstanding work item is to deploy my dmx control system. Run cabling, hook up all dimmers, debug the control program. Oh and actually test the pneumatic effects.
