First we have the [wireless broadband tv](http://www.gadgets-weblog.com/archives/location_free_tv.html "The Gadgets Weblog ") -- tv over wireless IP.

Combine with [broadcast tv downloading](http://www.lostremote.com/archives/001207.html) which is exploding.

Seems like we are at the tipping point -- analog tv sales could absolutely collapse in the next 5 years as people flip en masse to PCs and other digital devices. I think this could happen faster than we realize -- will the current generation of college students ever buy a regular TV?
