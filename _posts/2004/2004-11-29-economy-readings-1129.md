\* [Mitch Ratcliffe points to NY Times article on borrowing billions to allow private SS investments.](http://www.ratcliffeblog.com/archives/000229.html) This does just seem nutty, we are already incredibly underfunded on SS commitments, borrowing even more doesn't seem to be the path to fixing SS. \* From gadgetopia, [the velocity of wikipedia](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/11/22/TheVelocityOfWikipedia.html). Fascinating display of the power of openness and community. Competing against efforts like this must be painful. \* [Outsourcing to rural america](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/12/219202). \* [How to pitch into the long tail of bloggers](http://www.micropersuasion.com/2004/11/how_to_pitch_in.html) \* [Oprah's favorite things list](http://peterthink.blogs.com/thinking/2004/11/oprahs_favorite.html). I always find this show fascinating. The mania of the audience, the business behind the placements. Great theater and great business.
