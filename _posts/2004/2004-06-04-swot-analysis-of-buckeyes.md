[Nice SWOT analysis of Buckeye defense up at Bucknuts.com](http://ohiostate.theinsiders.com/2/264621.html).  Certainly a lot of reason for hope this year despite the many losses to the NFL -- linebacker in particular looks like a strength.  DBs and Punter are the big concerns -- given OSU's style of play the last couple years, a weak punting game could be a huge problem.

Next week Bucknuts will provide a similar treatment to the offense.
