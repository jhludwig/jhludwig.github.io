[Martin's been doing a lot of posting](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2004/12/the_real_winner.html) on his experiences with online retailers this season. Thought I'd share mine:

\* **Best**. [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com), [Cyberguys](http://www.cyberguys.com), [REI](http://www.rei.com), [Red Envelope](http://www.redenvelope.com), [Duluth Trading](http://www.duluthtrading.com). None of these sites are price leaders but they accurately report what they have in stock and what you can really get. I hate sites that promise stock they don't have. They all report status well on orders and let you know tracking numbers, etc. Red Envelope does a really nice job of reporting when a gift has been delivered to a recipient. Amazon has had some site flakiness the last couple of weeks but still has been good. Oh yes, [Shutterfly](http://www.shutterfly.com) should be in this list too, they have consistently gotten us our pictures in timely fashion -- I can't imagined wasting time printing pics myself. \* **Good**. [Newegg](http://www.newegg.com), [Organize-Everything](http://www.Organize-Everything.com), [Mountainmiser](http://www.Mountainmiser.com). Sites a little harder to navigate than the best, and online stock reporting not as accurate, but good communication and we were able to work things out. \* **So-so**. [Abesofmaine](http://www.Abesofmaine.com) is a price leader, but their online inventory info is a sham -- they claim to have everything but in fact...so they did call me and we were able to work out an order, and it showed up, but I don't feel great about the experience. \* **Danger Danger**. [Computerstufffree on ebay](http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQgotopageZ1QQsassZcomputerstuffreeQQsorecordsperpageZ50QQsosortorderZ1QQsosortpropertyZ1) -- will I ever see my product? Purchased weeks ago and no communication about shipping status, transaction status. I'm nervous... \* **Incomplete**. [Colorado Kayak](http://www.coloradokayak.com), [watchclick](http://www.watchclick.com). Transactions pending...
