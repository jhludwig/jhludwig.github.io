I get tons of traffic from people looking for product keys -- I have no idea why this stupid site ranks so high in Google on this topic. But here are some pointers folks:

\* Following an old posting -- [a little ludwig goes a long way: Recovering your product keys](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001429.html "a little ludwig goes a long way: Recovering your product keys") -- [Neotechcc.org](http://www.neotechcc.org/downloads.htm) has a tool to view your XP key. \* From the same thread, [Magical JellyBean](http://www.magicaljellybean.com/) can help you find your windows and office keys.

Beyond these tools, I can't help you.
