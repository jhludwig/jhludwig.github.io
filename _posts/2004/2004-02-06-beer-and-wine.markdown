From Dave at [just procrastinating](http://justprocrastinating.blogspot.com/2004_02_01_justprocrastinating_archive.html#107598409140199058 "just procrastinating"):

_Should I be drinking wine or beer? This study suggests beer for cancer prevention. While there are all kinds of studies that show red wine is good for heart disease. There really aren't enough hours in the evening for me to be doing all this drinking for my health. If I am going to have 2 glasses of red wine a day to help my heart and now 2 or 3 beers to fight off cancer, I might have to start drinking at the office._
