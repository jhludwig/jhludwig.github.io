[Last Man Standing](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0446611778/qid=1089915987/sr=1-10/ref=sr_1_10/102-6360179-9464923?v=glance&s=books "Amazon.com: Books: Last Man Standing") is the first book by David Baldacci that I've picked up. Good thriller, good action, interesting plot. The main character suffered from a deplorable lack of curiousity at a couple points, necessary to keep the plot intact, but otherwise was a good airplane read.
