\* Via [lockergnome](http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20041206_xraypc.phtml), [XrayPC](http://www.x-raypc.com/) -- another useful tool for isolating spyware and other malware. Also note this review of [spyware fighters](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/apps/spyware-removal.ars). You probably should be running a couple tools on all your machines. The free tool as part of the [yahoo toolbar](http://toolbar.yahoo.com/) is a great value. \* [Drivesitter](http://www.otwesten.de/drivesitter/features.htm). I'm not sure why but I love these tools that watch your harddisk and attempt to predict failures. I have backups of everything important and so a HD failure is not catastrophic for me but it is a time waster and I'd like to know if a failure is imminent. \* [MT Posting plugin for Newsgator](http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=50). Promises to combine two of my favorite pieces of software -- alas it doesn't work for me yet due to my security config, I'm in contact with Newsgator support. \* [Mike points in here to PDF speedup](http://www.larkware.com/dg2/TheDailyGrind513.html) -- man everyone needs to run this, the adobe reader is jammed so full of crap that most of us don't need. \* Now that I have finished Halflife 2 missions (though am still vastly entertained by the online deathmatch -- gravity guns rule!), here's a [whole trove of free games](http://www.abandonia.com/index2.php) \* Chris points to [a bunch of nice editors](http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/16/71140.html), one of these will probably find its way onto my machines. \* [PortQueryUI](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8355e537-1ea6-4569-aabb-f248f4bd91d0) from MSFT. Haven't had time to play with this yet but will soon. \* Another from MSFT -- a tool to see if have a [good MPEG decoder](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=de1491ac-0ab6-4990-943d-627e6ade9fcb). Why does the Windows Media Player make your codec config such a mystery? It is hard to tell what you have installed, unless you grovel the registry.

Lastly [a nice post from LarryO about hiding complexity](http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2004/12/01/273160.aspx). This sure feels like the reason a lot of software goes wrong...
