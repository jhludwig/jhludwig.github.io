\* [S5 continues to improve](http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1241583269414571/) -- I love the idea of this, a completely hosted presentation app. I never know which machine I am using has which document, this would solve that for me. \* [What's your phishing IQ](http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20041111_whats_your_phishing_iq.phtml) -- I test out a little too paranoid but I guess that is the right way to err. \* [Detecting digital image manipulation](http://www.photographyblog.com/weblog.php?id=P4542) -- great article, I am a little surprised that photographic evidence hasn't come under full scale legal attack given the ease with which it can be manipulated. \* [DxO optics pro](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1727695,00.asp?kc=PCRSS02129TX1K0000530). It will be interesting to see if there is a way to separate image forgery from legitmate optics enhancement like this software.
