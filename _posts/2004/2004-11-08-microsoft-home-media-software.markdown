Been a busy couple of weeks...

\* [Comcast deploying MSFT software](http://WWW.lostremote.com/archives/002971.html) -- how do I get on the trial? Will it work with [my existing fairly new comcast pvr settop box?](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001197.html) The comcast/moto provided software is so clunky, I would love an alternative. \* Looks like a little ecosystem of [media center addins](http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=16505954-c444-4d24-aa94-475bb26c1c58) is developing... \* [MSN remote record](http://www.engadget.com/entry/7685703146968882/) will let you remotely futz with your media center box...

It's too bad that it is so hard for consumers to get their hands on all the above -- waiting for your cable company to roll the features out is no way to kickstart a market, nor is depending on new pc purchases. Contrast with the [Halo2 release](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1719938,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532) which is going to be a huge hit -- consumers have an easy way to acquire the product.

**UPDATE**: according to someone who should know re the comcast/msft offering, "This is not a trial ? it?s full fledged commercial deployment to over a million subscriber in Washington state. The software will be eventually downloaded to all set top boxes including the older stuff, but I would warmly recommend upgrading to Comcast?s new dual-tuner DVR with HD. It?s a steal at $9.95 a month and if you already have HD, it?s only $4.95. You can order it starting next week". I can't find it on the comcast web site yet but I'll check daily.
