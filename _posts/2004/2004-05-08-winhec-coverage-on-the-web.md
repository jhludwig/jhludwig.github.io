Lots of stuff to read here...just some for the things I noticed:

\* All the [slide decks](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=c26da502-0b22-4a14-b910-b5bf96dbb50d&displaylang=en). **Update**: those are apparently the '03 decks. The '04 papers are [here](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winhec/papers04.mspx). Thanks to [Sam](http://samgentile.com/blog/archive/2004/05/07/11504.aspx). \* Jon Udell on [web services and discovery](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/05/07.html#a992) -- some people are upset because this is not Rendezvous \* A [review of the latest Longhorn build](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1586821,00.asp) -- "Castles" -- do we really need another organizing metaphor for networks? More details on the [UI bits here](http://www.longhornblogs.com/ndunlap/archive/2004/05/07/3413.aspx). \* [Server futures](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1588026,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535) -- the VM stuff is interesting \* Lots of [media center push](http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/index.php?p=1854) -- "...the PC is running out of time." -- not sure I buy that. \* [Tiers of UI experience](http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-5207576.html?tag=nefd.top) -- shades of Win286, Win386, etc. Interesting that the tiering is being driven by the graphics processors and not the CPUs. Will this tiering be transparent to ISVs -- will XAML work across all these experiences? \* [Whirlwind virtual tour](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1586152,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535) of WinHEC. \* [NGSCB is out](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/05/06/microsoft_managed_code_rethink/). [No it's not](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1585354,00.asp). \* Summary of [Allchin's talk](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1584391,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594) -- have you ported your driver to 64 bits yet? \* [Hidef audio driver released](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1580168,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532) -- this seems important but I have to admit I am confused about exactly what it is.
