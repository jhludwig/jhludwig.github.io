Several posts about Tivo getting limited rights to distribute copies of recorded programs -- [TiVoToGo goes legit - Engadget - www.engadget.com](http://www.engadget.com/entry/0884668578167657/ "TiVoToGo goes legit - Engadget - www.engadget.com") and [Reuters coverage](http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsArticle.jhtml?type=technologyNews&storyID=5873293&section=news). This would be the feature that would finally get me off my butt and upgrade my Tivo box.
