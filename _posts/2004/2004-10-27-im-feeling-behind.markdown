I can't get [fiber service to my house](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/26/221219) unlike some people. I don't have an [HDTV DVR](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1683851,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532) (though I do have HDTV). None of my PCs are [watercooled](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/10/25/1659233). I am not currently using a [cameraphone](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/curitel-p1-022708.php). I fear that I am losing my geek credentials.
