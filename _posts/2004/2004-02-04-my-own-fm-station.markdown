I'm wondering if it makes sense to broadcast my Halloween background music this year via FM, rather than running speaker wires all over the place. Ramsey has a lot of [FM kits](http://www.ramseyelectronics.com/). I'm not sure what the legality of running your own FM broadcast is, even if I just limit it to my yard. The rules for [Low Power FM](http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/lpfm/) don't permit individual stations. Sites like [Radio4All](http://www.radio4all.org/) give a lot of guidance tho on how to set up a station.
