In response to the snarky attitude about the eastside in [What the heck is he thinking ? Survival tips for Dave Winer while in Seattle](http://scottkoon.org/archives/2004/09/13/survival-tips-for-dave-winer-while-in-seattle/ "What the heck is he thinking ? Survival tips for Dave Winer while in Seattle"), here are some things you can only enjoy on the eastside:

\* Stay at the [Bellevue Club](http://www.bellevueclub.com/), one of the nicest hotels in Seattle \* Play a round of golf at [Sahalee (former site of the PGA)](http://www.sahalee.com/), [NewCastle (amazing views)](http://www.newcastlegolf.com/view.asp?id=97&page=1065), [Snoqualmie Ridge (a TPC course)](http://www.tpcsnoqualmieridge.com/) \* Visit the headquarters of [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com), [Costco](http://www.costco.com), or [Ignition](http://www.ignitionpartners.com) :) \* take a boat ride to [gene coulon park](http://www.ci.renton.wa.us/commserv/parks/coulon.htm) and get some fish and chips. \* Drive up Somerset hill at sunset for one of the greatest views of Seattle and Bellevue \* Eat at [Dixie's](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/131302_momentwith18.html) \* Meet people who don't have a snotty ?the eastside is so plebeian? attitude. :) \* attend [Salmon days festival](http://www.salmondays.org/home/) in issaquah \* Take an [argosy cruise](http://www.argosycruises.com/flash.cfm) out of kirkland and go see billg's, steveb's craig mccaw's houses \* go hiking -- [rattlesnake ledge](http://www.washingtonhikes.com/1999/rattlesnake/index2.html) is great, but there are a thousand destinations in the cascades \* go to [Fry's](http://www.frys.com/) \* go to [Crossroads](http://www.crossroadsbellevue.com/) for a funkier mall experience -- Firenze is a great italian restaurant there \* go visit the [Salish Lodge](http://www.salishlodge.com/index.cfm?CFID=1714708&CFTOKEN=23510698) for a meal or a night.
