[John Battelle's Searchblog: I Know I Saw It Somewhere...](http://battellemedia.com/archives/000249.php "John Battelle's Searchblog: I Know I Saw It Somewhere...") ... hmm, don't I just want to use my blog as my history of interesting and relevant sites? At least for me, the blog is the best repository of sites I need to remember -- I get to add commentary to the link, I can search the links, the links are available every place I need them.
