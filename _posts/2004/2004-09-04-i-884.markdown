I've been goaded again to look at [I-884: The Education Initiative](http://www.edtrustfund.org/about_i_884/index.html "I-884: The Education Initiative") and to encourage others to look at it. Seems like a very worthy effort --

\* Create 10,000 new high-quality preschool spaces for children who need them most \* Reduce class sizes and improve student achievement by fully funding Initiative 728; \* Raise the base pay for teachers and school employees, and community and technical college employees, to to what they would be receiving if the Legislature hadn't suspended I-732 last year; \* Provide additional classes in high school and support parent involvement; \* Expand Promise scholarships for the top 30% of graduating high school seniors and financial aid to keep college affordable for working and middle class students; \* Fund 25,000 additional enrollment slots in college in community and technical colleges and four-year universities and 7,000 new enrollments in high demand fields; \* Invest in university-based research that generates new businesses and jobs.
