Per PCMag, Zensys Z-Wave is [Home Automation that Works](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1645232,00.asp?kc=PCRSS02129TX1K0000530 "Home Automation that Works"). I'm going to order a kit and try it out -- it can't be any worse than x-10 -- i generally don't use x-10 at halloween time because the robustness and latency is just not up to snuff. But maybe this will be better.
