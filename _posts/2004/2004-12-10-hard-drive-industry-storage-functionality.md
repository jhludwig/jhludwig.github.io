First, an [interesting article about profitability in the hard drive industry](http://www.oligopolywatch.com/2004/12/06.html#a493) -- classic commodity economics are at play, and as consumers we are all benefiting.

At the same time, enterprise storage functionality is transitioning down to consumers -- [external sata connectors](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/storage/lacie-external-sata-drives-027389.php) allowing really high speed detached storage, [lightweight nas solutions](http://channels.lockergnome.com/linux/archives/20041210_instant_nas.phtml), a bunch of [software raid solutions](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&q=software+raid) -- but it is all way too hard to use for most people.

Seems to me like there is a path out of commodity pricing for the hard drive guys. The first player to bring enterprise storage functionality -- replication, auto-backup, hot swapping, pooling, etc -- to consumers and small businesses in a brainlessly easy to use package could be a big winner.
