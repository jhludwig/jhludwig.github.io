Just finished reading this. Every US citizen should read it -- or at least read the recommendation chapters (12 and 13) -- available for download at [National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States](http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm "National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States").

Reading it makes me feel much more activist about the problem. And much more realistic about the time it is going to take to overcome the terrorism problem -- the book mentions that we should think in terms of decades.
