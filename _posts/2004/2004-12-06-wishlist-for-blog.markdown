Things I'd like to add to the blog...

\* From [Windley](http://www.windley.com/2004/11/29.html#a1549), the [blogboxes](http://www.blogbox.com) look cool. \* from the [javascript weblog](http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000160021900/), [Feedsplitter](http://chxo.com/software/feedsplitter/index.html) looks like a nice way to integrate RSS content. [mt-rssfeed](http://www.timaoutloud.org/archives/000371.html) is another interesting tool... \* this [filemanager thingee](http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000503021769/) seems cool...always looking for something better than ftp...at the extreme end of the spectrum i could host a personal wiki for my files, [twiki seems interesting](http://gruia.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/9/30/151500.html) \* lots of [pointers and recos for log analysis tools](http://archive.scripting.com/2004/11/15#When:5:33:41PM) in the comments here \* [Converting to fluid styles in mt templates](http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/000855converting_from_fixed_to_fluid_style.php) -- good overview. \* [Yet another color scheme generator](http://www.wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/index-en.html) -- I'm a sucker for these. This one is pretty good. \* [Fixing the sidebar](http://www.movalog.com/archives/weblog-design/extending-the-sidebar.php) to go all the way to the bottom \* A [javascript image gallery](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/imagegallery/) -- cool and simple.
