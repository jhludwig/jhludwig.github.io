[The USB server: connecting USB devices to your home network](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/the_usb_server_connecting_usb_devices_to_your_home_network.php "The USB server: connecting USB devices to your home network"). very interesting. I wonder how it resolves ambiguities -- for instance my kodak camera dock, when i hit the sync button, tells my pc to sync -- which pc will get the message? analogous issue for my scanner. and then the other way around -- which machine is using the hard drive now, and how do i switch the drive to a different machine?
