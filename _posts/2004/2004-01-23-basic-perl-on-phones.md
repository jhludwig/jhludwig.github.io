From Mobilewhack, news that [Basic](http://www.mobilewhack.com/programming/basic/mobile_basic.html "MobileWhack") and [PERL](http://www.mobilewhack.com/programming/perl/perl_on_nokia.html) are coming to phones. I'd love to replace my stupid default phone screen with a little script that succinctly displayed the weather forecast, the most recent scores and next scheduled game for my favorite teams.
