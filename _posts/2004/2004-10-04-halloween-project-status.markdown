Declared victory this weekend after making a half dozen new tombstones and finishing my [window boards](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001526.html) project. My favorite new tombstone -- "Donna D. Dead" -- from the [master list of groaners](http://www.beautifulstuff.org/archives/000161.html#000161).
