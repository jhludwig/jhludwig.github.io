OK I upgraded. Pardon any problems. The default stylesheet for the admin interface seems to be screwed in firefox and in ie.

UPDATE: ok i fixed the problem with the admin interface, config problem on my end.

UPDATE: i've substantially tightened up my comment acceptance practices to deal with spam, i was flooded over the weekend. i may loosen as i get comfortable with typekey, moderation features, etc.
