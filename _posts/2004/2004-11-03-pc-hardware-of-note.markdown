\* I like the thinking behind [The Project PC: A New Windows Form Factor?](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1708151,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535 "The Project PC: A New Windows Form Factor?") -- I'm not sure you need wholly different form factors for different tasks, but I suspect there are rich veins to mine here \* [Matrix Raid explained up at Tom's.](http://www.tomshardware.com/motherboard/20040619/socket_775-30.html) I love this idea, what a great use of all the cheap mips and gigs i have. \* [Silenx fans](http://www.ahanix.com/casefans.html) -- 11 db fans -- i need to move all my machines to these. \* [Sonos digital music system](http://www.sonos.com/products/.) -- seems cool but I really want my ipod to be the controller...or I want the controller to work like an ipod when i am not at home.
