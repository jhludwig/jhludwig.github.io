I love [Marginal Revolution](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/), always great reading.

\* [How to fix social security](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/12/how_to_fix_soci.html) -- "Did you get that right? **Just stop boosting benefits.**" It probably is that simple. \* [Economics and Religion](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/12/economics_and_r.html) -- interesting thinking.
