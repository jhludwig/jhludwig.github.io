Again harvesting the halloween sig, a bunch of ideas for prop building:

\* When looking for scrap juicers as motors in props (for instance an axworthy ghost), look for metal body juicers -- a lot tougher than the plastic juicers. \* Use a Fishtank bubbler as source of bubbles in mad scientist lab -- cheap and easy! \* Lots of folks using windshield wiper motors for props. Some very nice characteristics -- back and forth repetitive motion, speed and intermittency controllable. Trying to achieve this kind of output with a standard rotary motor would be very complicated. \* How to [demonify a skull](http://www.angelfire.com/nc2/CreatureOTNight/demon.htm) \* [4 bar simulation software](http://www.boopack.com/software.html) -- very helpful for pneumatic design \* a bunch of [skulls and skull sections](http://www.stuartizm.com/skulls.htm) for use in projects. Oh and a source for inexpensive [skulls in bulk.](http://www.crypticimports.com/catalog.html)
