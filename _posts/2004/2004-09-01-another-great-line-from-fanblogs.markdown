[Site News - Fanblogs.com: Conventional Wisdom: Week One](http://www.fanblogs.com/fanblogs/archives/001322.php "Site News - Fanblogs.com: Conventional Wisdom: Week One") -- _I half expect to see, 5 or 10 years from now, a couple of PSU assistants holding up Paterno's still employed corpse between them on the sidelines. We can call it "Weekend at JoPa's"._

Seriously. This HAS to be a huge recruiting impediment for Penn State -- every kid knows that Joe is leaving sometime, no one wants to sign up for a program where the coaching regime may change half way through.
