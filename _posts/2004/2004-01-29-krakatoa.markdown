Whipped thru [Krakatoa : The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066212855/qid=1075439196/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-0807987-2027925 "Amazon.com: Books: Krakatoa : The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883") over last weekend. A very good read. Some background on Dutch colonial history in the area that was all new to me. And the story of the explosion is just phenomenal -- the explosion was heard 3000 miles away -- like hearing here in Seattle an explosion on the East Coast -- amazing. The writer does a good job making it come alive. And I'm a sucker for plate tectonics, and the author provides a decent background on the topic.
