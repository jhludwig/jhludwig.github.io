[CPU Mag](http://www.computerpoweruser.com/) seems to consistently have interesting articles and ads in it.  My favorite pc mag read.  Stuff in the recent issue:

- [Multimonitor displays](http://www.9xmedia.com/) -- wow this would be fun -- a wall of displays -- that would be the way to play Far Cry.
- [Newsmap](http://www.marumushi.com/apps/newsmap/newsmap.cfm) -- a great way to browse google news, you get a real sense of what is hot
- [This Zalman CPU cooler](http://www.zalman.co.kr/usa/product/cnps7000a-alcu.htm) gets good reviews for very low noise output.
- [Cooligy](http://www.cooligy.com/) may be bringing even better cooling systems to market this year tho.
- [A tool just to remove CoolWebSearch variants](http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/cwschronicles.html).  That is how bad spyware has become.  Now you need a whole suite of tools to attack it.
