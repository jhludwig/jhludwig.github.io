[It's Comeback Time for Luxury Watches](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/06/business/06watch.html?ex=1388811600&en=69abdca90ef7e857&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND "It's Comeback Time for Luxury Watches") -- I fell in love with [Audemars Piguet](http://www.audemarspiguet.com/home.html#) pieces thru an advertisement and sent away for their catalog. Now that's a luxury watch -- some of them are priced at ~$400K. I concluded that, at that price, someone would cut my arm off as I walked down the street, just to steal the watch.
