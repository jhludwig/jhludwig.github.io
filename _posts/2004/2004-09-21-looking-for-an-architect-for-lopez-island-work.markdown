A couple recommendations are [greene partners | architecture and design](http://www.greenepartners.com/ "greene partners | architecture and design") and [Cutler-Anderson](http://www.cutler-anderson.com/index.html).

Update: A little googling also brought me to [Tranfo](http://www.tranfoarchitect.com/) , [Island Architecture](http://www.islandarchitecture.net/homes.htm), [Suyama Peterson Deguchi](http://www.suyamapetersondeguchi.com/architecture/residential/lopez.asp), [David Coleman](http://www.davidcoleman.com/home.htm)
