Stopped at [PCC Natural Markets](http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com/ "PCC Natural Markets") and [QFC](http://www.qfconline.com/) today. Not a chicken breast to be found, very little packaged chicken at all. Just odds and ends. Plenty of beef on hand tho. I'd have to say that mad cow worries are definitely affecting consumer behaviour.
