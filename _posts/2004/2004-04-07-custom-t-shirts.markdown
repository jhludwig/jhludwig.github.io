p. Hey I needed a goofy t-shirt recently and found [Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com/). Very easy to create my own shirt, easy to upload graphics, and the t-shirt shipped 1 day later and arrived fast. Great service, good range of products, very easy web-based design tool. Oh and very economic to order quantity 1.

p. I also considered [Designashirt](http://www.designashirt.com) and it probably had even nicer web-based design tools (flash based as i recall) but they had a minimum order of 6. But the web experience was good.
