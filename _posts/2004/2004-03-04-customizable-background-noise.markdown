Back in the day when the [NetMeeting](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/netmeeting/) team worked for me, I always wanted to add custom background noise and video to a conference -- bluescreening without the bluescreen. We needed more generations of Moore's Law on our side to make this happen, but looks like we are on the way there.
