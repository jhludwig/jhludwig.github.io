34 miles into our drive to LA and we hit a big whomping chunk of metal in the road -- and there goes a tire. Could have been worse -- we were right at the Federal Way exit; later in the drive in southern Oregon or central California we might have had a real long wait.

But [AAA service](http://www.aaa-calif.com/ "Automobile Club of Southern California - We're Always With You") was great -- great call center, quick arrival, found an open tire center for us, took us right there. Well worth the annual membership fee.
