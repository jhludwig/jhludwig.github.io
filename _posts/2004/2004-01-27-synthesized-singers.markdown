Freaky, now you can create synthesized singers from correctly annotated lyrics and scores -- [Slashdot | Yamaha Releases Singing Synthesis Software](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/26/198222 "Slashdot | Yamaha Releases Singing Synthesis Software"). I wonder what range of vocal performances this can encapsulate -- I was listening to Led Zep/Robert Plant in the car this am, can you specify a vocal performance in his style? I am sure the answer is no, but how many iterations of Moore's Law and algorithm development will we need before you can do something like this?
