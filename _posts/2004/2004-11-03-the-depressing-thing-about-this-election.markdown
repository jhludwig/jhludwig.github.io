...is not the presidential results. I am sure the country will muddle through whoever is inhabiting that office.

The thing that is of most local, immediate importance to me is the failure of I-884, the education funding initiative. I'm suprised about the totality of the failure here. Obviously the electorate does not like new taxes. It is obviously going to take way more effort to increase our educational funding -- it is going to take unified statewide political support -- both parties, all major state and federal elected officials -- as well as private sector leaders to ever push any significant educational funding package through.
