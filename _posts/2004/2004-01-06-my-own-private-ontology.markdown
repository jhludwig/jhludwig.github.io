Here in the age of XML and personal publishing, we all better start brushing up on ontologies -- [Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology](http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/people/dlm/papers/ontology101/ontology101-noy-mcguinness.html "What is an ontology and why we need it"). Or maybe just a [faceted classification](http://www.miskatonic.org/library/facet-web-howto.html), though it sounds a lot cooler to say "ontology".
