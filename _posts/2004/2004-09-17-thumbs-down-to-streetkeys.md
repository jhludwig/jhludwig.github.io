I previously blogged that i was going to try [Streetkeys.com](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001609.html "a little ludwig goes a long way: Streetkeys.com") to get a replacement key. well don't bother, they don't really seem to be able to offer the service they promise. without ever explaining why, they refunded our money and told us "we can't help you". We have to get a key the hard way now -- have the car towed to a dealership and have the key cut and matched at the dealership. Sad.
