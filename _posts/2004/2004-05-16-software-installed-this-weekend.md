\* [Blogjet](http://www.blogjet.com). A nice posting utility but doesn't seem to deal with Textile2 formating very well -- blogjet tries to insert a bunch of formatting codes which collide with textile2. I'd like a posting tool that emits clean textile2 output. \* [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html). Seems like a pretty nice casual editor. [Scott's hint](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ad1bdaf7-41a7-4e47-ba20-ca0c3f68d604) to rename to N.exe is a huge timesaver. \* [Regex coach](http://weitz.de/regex-coach/). Very cool, I need a lot of coaching. \* [The Ultimate Troubleshooter](http://blogs.officezealot.com/marc/archives/000564.html). You have to pay for it to get any value but it seems like a worthwhile tool (and I've always liked the site).
