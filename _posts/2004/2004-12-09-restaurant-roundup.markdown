Places we've hit recently...

\* [Supreme](http://www.supremerestaurant.com/) in Madrona. Loved it! Great neighborhood place, super service, great food, a calm and relaxing place. \* [Serafina](http://www.serafinaseattle.com/). The food was good, we'd go back, but it was very crowded and a little frantic. Good if you are in the mood for that. \* [Firenze](http://www.firenzerestaurant.com/). One of our consistent favorites. Not in a very promising space, but great food e.very time. \* [Queen City Grill](http://www.gourmetfoodplaza.com/Series/Restaurants/QueenCityGrill.htm). Another consistently good place. Not as trendy as some of the places in Belltown, but always good. \* [Flying Fish](http://www.flyingfishseattle.com/). Did the chef just change? We were very disappointed there recently. Every dish was bland and poorly cooked. It will take some dramatic change for us to ever go back.
