Installed [James Seng's blog: Bayesian filter for MT](http://james.seng.cc/archives/000152.html "James Seng's blog: Bayesian filter for MT") tonight to deal with the increasing flow of comment spam. Decided to try this solution because it intrigued me, and because mt-blacklist seemed like a pain to install. We'll see how it goes.
