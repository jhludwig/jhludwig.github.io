\* [A tale of two condiments](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/10/tale_of_two_con.html) -- more than you ever wanted to know about the design, production, and marketing of mustard and catsup. I am not a catsup user but this made me reconsider. \* [The future of television advertising](http://www.beyondvc.com/2004/10/customized_ads_.html) -- interesting thoughts. the one thread I find interesting is the notion of late binding of commercials at the point of consumption -- rather than creating one commercial that is slammed into a show at the point of broadcast, perhaps we will move to a model where commercials are inserted much later and on a more personalized basis. Interesting.
