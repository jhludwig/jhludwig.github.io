Some good notes on [Diary of a Something L](http://diaryofa1l.mikeshecket.com/2004/09/hey-mike-say-something-aboutbuckeyes.html "Diary of a Something L"):

"Lydell Ross couldn't find a hole on a miniature golf course"

"last year, whenever when ran out of the "I" or offset "I" with a FB as a lead blocker we averaged 5.5 yards per carry...This ridiculous formation with TE, wingback, TE accomplishes nothing...You don't run a counter as the first play of the game. The point of a counter is that it COUNTERS something"
