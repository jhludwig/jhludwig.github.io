One of our faucets is busted, and [Moen](http://www.moen.com/consumer/homepage/index.cfm?CFID=3911919&CFTOKEN=7e0462be002f8c26-0E9EC329-9EEA-8AF5-653F56919DAF4EAA "Moen Consumer Home Page") handles this so well -- they walk you through a process to identify your faucet and then they send you the parts you need, free of charge. Great experience.
