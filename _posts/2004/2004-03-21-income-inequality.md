Interesting study at [Marginal Revolution: Income inequality over time](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/03/income_inequali.html "Marginal Revolution: Income inequality over time"): _War and other disruptions appear to damage capital income more than labor income. If that is the case, a healthy and peaceful society might have increasing income inequality. In other words, if we are lucky, income inequality will increase even more._
