[Reardon](http://www.openwave.com/us/news_room/press_releases/2003/20030915_opwv_reardon_0915.htm) reminded me recently that I read a lot of books. I looked over [the list](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/cat_books.html) this year and was a little suprised myself. And what a lot of dreck in there, I wonder why I plow thru some of this.

But to save others from plowing thru the dreck, here is my short list of good reads this year. Some new, some quite old.

**Fiction**:

\* [The Glass Bead Game](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312278497/qid=1081897958/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) by Hesse. 3/4s of a year later and I can still recollect vast swathes of the book as well as particular scenes. Well worth the time. \* [The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/103-6281811-4989432?index=blended&keyword=The+Curious+Incident+of+the+Dog+in+the+Night-time). Totally expected to hate it, thought it was just trendy, but this was a solid and memorable story. \* [A Confederacy of Dunces](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802130208/qid=1082873989/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) by Toole. Great great characters, dying to be a movie. \* [Musashi](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/4770019572/qid=1084987282/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) from which I picked up [my favorite quote of the year.](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001475.html)

**Non-fiction:**

\* [The 9/11 Commission Report](http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm). Again, every US citizen should read this. \* And while you are at it, read [Imperial Hubris](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&s=books&n=507846). At the very least, thought-provoking and internally consistent. \* And lest these two depress you too much, read [At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400041767/qid=1091718131/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) for a view on a country and culture that is really screwed up.
