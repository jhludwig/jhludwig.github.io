6/8 issue of [pc mag](http://www.pcmag.com/) has a big utility review (i don't see it online). Cool stuff I saw:

\* [RipDigital: Convert your music CDs to a digital music library](http://www.ripdigital.com/ "RipDigital: Convert your music CDs to a digital music library") -- you send them all your cds, they send them back ripped on a dvd. Sure you can do yourself but this is a huge timesaver. \* A lot of keyboard macro utilities -- [Quickeys](http://www.cesoft.com) or [Perfect Keyboard](http://www.pitrinec.com/pkindex.htm) seem worth trying \* I really have to try [Object Desktop](http://www.stardock.com) one of these days, I see continual references to it
