[Tong Family Blog: 19" LCD Monitors](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/001309.html "Tong Family Blog: 19") -- me, i've gone 20 now with the [Dell 2001FP](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19&sku=320-1578&category_id=4009) and I can't go back. the display looks really great with the ati 9800 on my one machine -- not quite as sharp with my oem nvidia machine. but still wonderful. A little more than rich wanted to spend but worth it. My 15" at work looks totally pathetic now.
