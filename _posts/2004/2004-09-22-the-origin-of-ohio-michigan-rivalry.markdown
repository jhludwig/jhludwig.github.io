Good article on the [historical origins of Ohio-Michigan rivalry](http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/historygenealogy/a/ohiomichigan.htm) -- thanks [Mike](http://www.connetcompany.com/aboutus/bio.asp?id=30). (The link on the second page to the alternative lyrics to "Hail to the Victors" is busted, but [you can find the words here](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~dwilson/rsfc/fightsongsII.txt) (along with a huge number of other pejorative versions of fight songs))
