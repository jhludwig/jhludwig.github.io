\* Nice story [via Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/pay-for-cabs-by-phone-026701.php) on one of our investments, [MobileLime](http://www.mobilelime.com) \* [Rendition Networks acquired by Opsware](http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3442911), congrats! \* Andy Sack points to a [sarcastic NYTimes piece](http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2004/11/thanks.html) by friedman -- as always a fun read. \* Adrian found a nice [roundup of wifobs](http://www.geekfishing.net//2004/11/29/wifi_finder_round_up.html) and [an incredibly valuable nokia headset adapter.](http://www.geekfishing.net/2004/11/24/nokia_headset_adaptor.html) \* Johnza has a nice post on [how to switch customers](http://marketingplaybook.com/2004/12/02/build_vs_buy_vs_take.html) away from a competitor. Great lessons in here. Also a good post on [PR around funding events.](http://marketingplaybook.com/2004/11/28/funding_releases_when_to_pull_the_trigger.html) Across both these posts, I draw a great lesson -- clear focus on your exact goal can always pay off. But you have to know your goal and you have to focus. \* Rich as always has a cornucopia of tech posts -- [Yahoo Toolbar](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2004/11/24/get_yahoo_toolbar.html) (I agree, you have to get this for the spyware tool), [RockXP](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2004/11/24/rockxp.html) for PID recovery, a [good set of podcasting links](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/blogs/2004/11/25/podcast_software.html), his [recos on must have software](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2004/11/26/software_i_would_pay_for.html), the [beginnings of his quest to build a htpc](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2004/12/01/htpc.html). how does the guy have time for a life and job?
