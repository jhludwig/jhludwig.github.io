These might be cool -- [meryl.net articles: WordToys](http://www.meryl.net/articles/archives/002818.php "meryl.net articles: WordToys") -- though it has been a month of Sundays since I've used Word. Mostly i type email, blog entries, and then some structured stuff like XML, HTML, PHP, etc. It is a rare day I type a word doc.
