[Belkin's new Bluetooth printer adapter](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/belkins_new_bluetooth_printer_adapter.php "Belkin's new Bluetooth printer adapter") -- at first i thought this looked cool but then looking at the connectors on it, it requires its own wallwart power connector -- so you don't get rid of a cable at all, you just trade usb for power. seems dumb. can't it leach power off the usb connector?
