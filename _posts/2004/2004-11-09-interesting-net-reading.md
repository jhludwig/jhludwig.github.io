\* [Reputation Services](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2004/11/reputation_serv.html#comments) -- second interesting conversation in a week that I've seen/had on this topic. Hmm. \* [Peer to peer alarm systems](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/11/peertopeer_alar.html). Fascinating -- embedding of peer to peer functionality in everyday systems. \* [Mark Cuban on the music industry](http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/3856521420807387/) -- a kajillion people have pointed to this, let's hope some lawmakers read it.
