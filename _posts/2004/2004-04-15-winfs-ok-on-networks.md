[What? They cut WinFS??](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmazner/archive/2004/04/13/112822.aspx "What? They cut WinFS??") -- sounds like maybe WinFS hasn't been scaled back much, tho this posting is pretty vague about how it works on legacy media and networks (a reasonably hard problem). It certainly hints that WinFS will work just fine on a network against a remote WinFS machine -- Longhorn or Longhorn server.
