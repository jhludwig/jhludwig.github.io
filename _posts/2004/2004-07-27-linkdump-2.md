\* [Best Free Software](http://www.pcworld.com/resource/printable/article/0,aid,116456,00.asp) from PCWorld \* [first details of MT 3.1](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/07/first_details_o.shtml). Anxious to play with the category features. \* [Macrovision CD copy protection](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/26/macrovision_cds300_7/). Time to turn off autoplay. \* [Picasa for free](http://www.picasa.com/content/download.php?promo-hpp1intl). \* [Jerry Colonna's blog](http://madeleines.typepad.com/madelines/) \* [What's talking all my memory?](http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=49492f0c-8675-4b00-b313-91c6c798962a) Great tools \* [Maxthon](http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2004/7/24/111598.html). Formerly MyIE2. \* [Future of PC Audio](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1625948,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532). Reads to me like all the value is migrating to Intel and Microsoft -- a shocking state of affairs. \* [Bidrobot](http://www.bidrobot.com). I really should try this but the site scares me, I don't feel like they are going to respect my privacy much. \* [IE blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/). The [wiki](http://channel9.msdn.com/wiki/default.aspx/Channel9.InternetExplorerFeedback) is even cooler. \* [Local search](http://donatacom.com/papers/pomo28.htm), as seen by a tv guy. \* [McDonalds outsources order handling](http://brandautopsy.typepad.com/brandautopsy/2004/07/welcome_to_mcdo.html). Amazing what broadband can do.
