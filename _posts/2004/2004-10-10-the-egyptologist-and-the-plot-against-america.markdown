[The Egyptologist](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400062500/qid=1097465416/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-6978860-9145740?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) by Arthur Phillips -- a cleverly and artfully constructed book, but ultimately not that interesting. It is pretty obvious where the story is going, the characters aren't that memorable, I've read better stories about psycho main characters.

[The Plot Against America](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618509283/qid=1097465678/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_2_1/102-6978860-9145740) by Philip Roth. This month's trendy read, it started out with an interesting premise and interesting characters. But the bad guys are one-dimensional stereotypes, and the plot is explained as a typical Nazi world domination scheme, instead of a more morally ambiguous and perhaps realistic situation. I've read better Nazi world domination novels.
