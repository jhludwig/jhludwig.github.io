Nice summary of the [places to look for malware](http://www.governmentsecurity.org/articles/Placesthatvirusesandtrojanshideonstartup.php) on your system, found via [Scripting News](http://archive.scripting.com/2004/09/29#When:8:21:21AM). i didn't know about the c:\\explorer.exe trick.

[Trojan JPEGs hit the net](http://channels.lockergnome.com/news/archives/20040929_trojan_jpegs_hit_the_net.phtml). The Microsoft tools for alerting and fixing this problem seem poorly implemented.
