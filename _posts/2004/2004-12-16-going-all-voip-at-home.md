Rich is [looking at solutions to go all voip at home](http://www.tongfamily.com/2004/12/16/finding_a_4port_voip_gateway.html).

Rich some things to look at:

\* [Mega list of sip products](http://www.pulver.com/products/sip/) up at pulver.com \* Another at [Sipcenter](http://www.sipcenter.com/sip.nsf/html/SIP+Phones+and+Adaptors) \* open source pbx -- [asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/)

The problem I struggle with is this -- I have a lot of cheap handsets around the house connected by cat5 back to my wiring closet to my existing pbx. If i replace this pbx -- what hardware bridges out to all these analog handsets? Or do I replace them (at great cost) with sip handsets -- are there any really cheap sip handsets?
