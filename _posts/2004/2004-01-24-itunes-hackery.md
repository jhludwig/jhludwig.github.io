[Tong Family Blog: What is MyTues, QTFairUse and Audio Hijack?](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_music/001346.html "Tong Family Blog: What is MyTues, QTFairUse and Audio Hijack?") -- Rich has a good summary of all the iTunes hackery that is going on. Kind of humorous to read articles over the last month that file-sharing is declining -- sure seems alive and well.

Rich, I wonder how long til someone writes a CD drive emulator that just lays down the written tracks as MP3s on the hard disk. There are CD emulators today that read/write to hard disk; seems like no reason you couldn't recode the data as MP3 along the way.
