Traded mail with [Phil](http://thebogles.com/blog/) yesterday who is in Sri Lanka I believe for the holidays -- says he and his family are OK -- great news amidst all the general bad news.

**UPDATE**: Phil says that Unicef and the local Lions club seem to be doing great efforts at relief, if anyone needs ideas for what charities to support.
