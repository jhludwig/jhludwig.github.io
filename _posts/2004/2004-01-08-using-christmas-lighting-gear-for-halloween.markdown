Lots of discussion in the MoM group about using Christmas lighting and control gear for Halloween. Lots of good pointers -- [Light-o-rama](http://store.lightorama.com/software.html) control software, Dasher at the [Christmas Cave](http://www.christmascave.com/software.htm), [Animated Lighting](http://www.animatedlighting.com/) for all kinds of controllers and props, a simple [two-outlet fade controller](http://www.christmasdonebright.com/(qahkokir44gldlrjkymxbf45)/product_details.aspx?ProductID=649&CatID=46). Now controlling Christmas lights is actually a bit different than Halloween -- Christmas lighting is not intended to surprise, so much of the software and gear doesn't pay attention to latency, and doesn't have all the input/control options. But some useful stuff here anyway.
