[The Seattle Times: Sports](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/sports/links/uwfinances08.html "The Seattle Times: Sports") -- interesting look at the budgets of the Pac-10 athletic departments. UW at $45M, no one over $50M in the conference. Last I heard, Ohio State's budget was on the order of $80M, and I am sure that a lot of other Big-10 and SEC schools are in this range, given stadium sizes at these schools (a primary driver of revenue). Over time it is going to be tough to keep up with programs that can substantially outspend you on facilities and staff.
