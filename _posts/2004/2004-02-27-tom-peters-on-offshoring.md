Great [Observations](http://www.tompeters.com/toms_world/observations.asp "Observations") from Tom Peters on offshoring. The ones that especially resonated with me:

\* "Off-shoring" will continue; the tide cannot be reversed.

\* Service jobs are a bigger issue than manufacturing jobs, by an order of magnitude.

\* We are in the middle of a once every hundred years' (or so) productivity burst -- which is good for us ... in the long haul.

\* Americans' "unearned wage advantage" (Born in the U.S.A.) could be erased ... permanently.

\* The wholesale, increasingly upscale entry of 2.5 billion people (China, India) into the global economy at an accelerating rate is virtually unfathomable. Unfathomable = Unpredictable, exceptional challenges, amazing opportunities.

\* Free trade works. Period. It makes the world a safer place ... in the long haul. The process is not pretty at times. (Sometimes long times.) Those who dutifully followed yesterday's rules yet are displaced must be helped when the "rules change." Such help must not be in perpetuity -- it demands a sunset date.

\* Big companies do not create jobs, and historically have not created jobs. Big companies are not "built to last;" they almost inexorably are "built to decline."

Thanks to [Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/02/25.html#a6676) for the pointer.
