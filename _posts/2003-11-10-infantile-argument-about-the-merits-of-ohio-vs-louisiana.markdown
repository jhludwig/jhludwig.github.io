Having fun over on [fanblogs](http://www.theludwigs.com) arguing with a real dedicated Louisiana fan -- [Latest BCS Rankings](http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/archives/000625.php). Amazing how much data the census department provides -- the [school spending data](http://www.census.gov/govs/school/01fullreport.pdf) is amazing -- look at the spread across the country in figure 4 -- an over 2x difference between the big spending states (NY) and the bottom (UT). Now some of this is just cost of living probably but a dramatic difference nevertheless.  
  
And to the point -- Ohio outspends Louisiana per student by a wide margin.
