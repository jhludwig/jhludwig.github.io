- [The Testament of Mary](http://www.amazon.com/Testament-Mary-Colm-Toibin-ebook/dp/B007EDOTPS) by Colm Toibin. Very moving tale of the last days of Jesus, written from the viewpoint of his mother. Great capturing of the anguish of a mother losing a son in terrible fashion.
- [Vanished Kingdoms](http://www.amazon.com/Vanished-Kingdoms-Rise-States-Nations-ebook/dp/B0052RDIAA) by Norman Davies. Thorough discussion of 17 kingdoms/empires/states that have disappeared from the world. Not Rome or Sparta, but lesser known examples, that probably all thought they would last forever. Humbling but a bit of a slog.
- [The Prince of Risk](http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Risk-Novel-Christopher-Reich-ebook/dp/B00AP2VQCO) by Christopher Reich. After the prior book needed some mental floss. Reich writes a solid suspense tail. A fine distraction.
