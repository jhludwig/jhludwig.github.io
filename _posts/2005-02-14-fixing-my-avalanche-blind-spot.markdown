My [Chevy Avalanche](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000788.html) has a blind spot in which you can hide Mount Rainer, it is just huge. Backing up has always terrified me as I could easily be running over a child, a horse, a small car, and I'd never know it.

The good folks at [Benchmark Motoring](http://www.benchmarkmotoring.com/) helped me out -- they installed a rearview camera with fisheye lens, just mounted above the trailer hitch. When I shift into reverse, it takes over the nav screen and displays a rear facing video feed.

I didn't think it would help that much...but I am hooked. I can't imagine ever getting any car without this again. Not only is it a great safety feature, but your parallel parking becomes brilliant with this. So much better than a rear view mirror. Highly recommended.
