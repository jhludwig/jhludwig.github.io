- [Songbird: Killer Add-ons Make Songbird So Much Better.](http://lifehacker.com/5108978/killer-add+ons-make-songbird-so-much-better) pretty nice, love the plugin feature, seems to leverage mozilla work here
- [Textflow](http://lifehacker.com/5098950/textflow-offers-a-new-take-on-collaboration) \-- eh, failed totally on first doc import
- [Google Sketchup](http://lifehacker.com/5090600/google-sketchup-7-released) -- don't have much current use for but maybe for halloween planning...
- [Aerosnap](http://lifehacker.com/5085657/aerosnap-brings-the-windows-7-snap-feature-to-xp-vista) \-- eh, just seems to die immediately
