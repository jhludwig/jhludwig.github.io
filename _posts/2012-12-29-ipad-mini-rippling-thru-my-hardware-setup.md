Ok I got an iPad mini for Christmas -- thanks family! The lack of retina display does bother me, it is super noticeable. I will certainly upgrade to an iPad mini retina when it exists.

But it is interesting to see the impact on the rest of the gear in my bag.

\* obviously the big iPad will not be in my bag much anymore, the mini is just so light and convenient. I need to figure out what to do with old iPads. Can I use them as monitors for raspberry Pi's? \* do I need to carry an eInk kindle anymore? On the one hand, the mini fits nicely in a hand and so can supplant the kindle. On the other, the mini is so light, there is really no problem carrying both, and the kindle still has that great battery life. \* needless to say the Surface is rarely in my bag -- and it now seems really obese in light of the iPad mini. \* I used to carry a 17" laptop. Now I'm at 15". Really wondering if 13" would work just as well .. And for the first time considering the 11" Air. I pretty much run every app full screen at this point, is the larger screen buying me that much?
