[At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig : Travels Through Paraguay](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400041767/qid=1091718131/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-8453610-5005550?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig : Travels Through Paraguay") is absolutely the best Paraguay travelogue that I have ever read.

OK I'll go further, it was a very entertaining travelogue period. Gimlette has a good dry style, which is needed for book about a country with such a tragicomic history. Paraguay seems to have a pretty unfair share of misadventures, some of its own making, and sometimes buffetted by outside forces.

During this election season, everytime you worry about our system of government -- pick up this book and read a chapter or two. You will feel better.
