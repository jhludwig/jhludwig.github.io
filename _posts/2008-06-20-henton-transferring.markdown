[Antonio Henton, On the Midnight Train toÂ Georgia - Sunday Morning Quarterback](http://www.sundaymorningqb.com/2008/6/20/555361/antonio-henton-on-the-midn) -- this is too bad, he seems like a great talent. But as another commentator noted, he has had a rough ride at times at OSU and a clean start may serve him well. Good luck to him!
