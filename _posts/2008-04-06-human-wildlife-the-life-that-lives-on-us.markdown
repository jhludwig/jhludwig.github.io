[Amazon.com: Human Wildlife: The Life That Lives on Us by Robert Buckman](http://www.amazon.com/Human-Wildlife-Life-That-Lives/dp/0801874076/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207503882&sr=8-1). Fun book about the vast number of helpful, benign, and dangerous critters that live on and in our bodies. You really get the sense that you are a walking bag of bugs. The pictures of eyebrow mites are awesome! Not a kindle book, pictures matter a lot to the narrative.
