Deployed all my audio systems this weekend -- the 4 speaker thunder and lightning system near the door way, the greetings/music systems at each driveway entrance, the graveyard annex system, and the talking tree with voice mod box.  Tested all, sound all ok.

Deployed fog tubing as well.  Didn't test fogger but it is ready to test tonight perhaps.

Next up -- lighting and control cabling deployment.  By this weekend should have all the infrastructure deployed.
