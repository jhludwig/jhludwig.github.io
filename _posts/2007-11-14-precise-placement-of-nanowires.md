This seems pretty great -- [Breakthrough toward industrial-scale production of nanodevices](http://www.physorg.com/news114096073.html "Breakthrough toward industrial-scale production of nanodevices") -- full PDF [here](http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/sample.cgi/cmatex/2007/19/i22/pdf/cm071798p.pdf). Nanowire-based devices can be used for very small, very fast circuit elements, but have been difficult to accurately place on a chip substrate. This seems to address that challenge.
