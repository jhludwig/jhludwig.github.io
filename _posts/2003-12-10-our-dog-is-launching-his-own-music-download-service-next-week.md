Inspired by this announcement, [MediaGuardian.co.uk | New media | Coke puts fizz into music downloads](http://media.guardian.co.uk/newmedia/story/0,7496,1102525,00.html "MediaGuardian.co.uk | New media | Coke puts fizz into music downloads"), our dog is launching a music download service next week. As he explains it, existing codecs trim out too much high frequency sound, leaving most downloaded music sounding too flat for him and his canine pals. And iTunes offers very little from [dog-themed record labels](http://www.google.com/search?q=dog+music), [dog classics](http://www.gloryvision.com/dogs.html), or [new age dog music](http://www.consciouschoice.com/issues/cc1612/songsfordogs1612.html).
