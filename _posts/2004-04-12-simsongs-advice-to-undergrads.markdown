[Simson's Weblog: Looking Back at MIT](http://www.simson.net/blog/archives/000063.php "Simson's Weblog: Looking Back at MIT") -- My own experience doesn't support the "Grades really matter" point but then I generally had decent grades. But all the rest of this counsel seems very wise. Choice of major really really doesn't matter -- what matters is that you learn how to think -- how to analyze and synthesize -- not so much what you think about. My undergraduate years were all about analysis, I didn't really learn much synthesis until graduate school, you need both.
