A good pointer to building your own [MythTV-based PVR at PVRblog](http://pvr.blogs.com/pvr/2003/07/mythtv_howto.html "MythTV how-to | PVRblog"). I guess they get their listings from [Zap2It](http://www.zap2it.com/index) which is where this system falls apart relative to my DirecTivo box in my view -- the Zap2It guide doesn't correctly list PPV shows as one example problem. PVR code seems to be readily available at the point, the discriminator between implementations is going to be things like quality of Program Guide.
