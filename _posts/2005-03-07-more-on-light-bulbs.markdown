I got a couple questions about [my post on LED lightbulbs](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001804.html). While the LED bulbs are not ready for primetime, I have had good luck with [these compact fluorescents from HDb](http://www.homedepot.com/prel80/HDUS/EN_US/diy_main/pg_diy.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1268801727.1110222142@@@@&BV_EngineID=cceladdedellkfdcgelceffdfgidgln.0&CNTTYPE=PROD_META&CNTKEY=Super%20Categories/Home%20D%E9cor%20%26%20Organizing&MID=9876&pos=p04). They fit a standard socket and provide a very warm light, almost a little too yellow. But certainly no hint of blue.

I also recently ordered from http://www.lumitroncop.com and from http://www.1000bulbs.com. I ordered compact fluorescents to replace r20s and r30s (spots), we'll see how those work.

I was motivated to move to incandescent alternatives because my office at home is too hot between all the PCs and devices and lights. Now that some have worked, I am motivated to move the whole house over for the energy savings. The one application that I am stuck with incandescents is for lights on dimming circuits -- fluorescents don't like variable voltage.
