Just finished [Cousin Felix Meets the Buddha: and Other Encounters in China and Tibet](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0374299986/qid=1054698663/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-0533945-0140168?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Cousin Felix Meets the Buddha: and Other Encounters in China and Tibet") by Lincoln Kaye. Great read, very much enjoyed especially the title story about his travels with a living Buddha -- fascinating.
