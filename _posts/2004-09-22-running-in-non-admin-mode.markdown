Per LarryO, a lot of people are [running XP in non-admin mode](http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2004/09/22/232938.aspx) at MSFT. Some great pointers in his article -- [Aaron's blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/aaron_margosis) and his post on [RunAs](http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2004/06/23/163229.aspx). I've had problems making non-admin work on the machine in our family room -- mostly when I am at the machine and I want to do something not permitted -- I have to dig into this RunAs post. Particularly as it applies to running CPLs and manipulating network connections.
