Oh yeah, read this recently too -- [Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/043935806X/qid=1057004831/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-1448938-0711023 "Amazon.com: Books: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)"). Some interesting developments for the series, but I thought the quest in this particular book was a little lame.
