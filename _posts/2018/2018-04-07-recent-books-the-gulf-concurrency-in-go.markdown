- [The Gulf](https://www.amazon.com/Gulf-Making-American-Sea/dp/1631494023) by Jack E. Davis.  [![](images/gulf-209x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2018/04/recent-books-the-gulf-concurrency-in-go/gulf/)A history of the development of the Gulf of Mexico over the last 300 years sounds like it could be dull, but it is actually pretty interesting, though there is a ton of detail in here.  Enjoying it -- if I ever planned to the move to the Gulf Coast, this would be essential.
- [Concurrency in Go](https://www.amazon.com/Concurrency-Go-Tools-Techniques-Developers/dp/1491941197) by Katherine Cox-Buday.  Ok this is the far more essential book to read about Go, the intro to Go book I previously read should have had all this material.  This is the interesting stuff.
