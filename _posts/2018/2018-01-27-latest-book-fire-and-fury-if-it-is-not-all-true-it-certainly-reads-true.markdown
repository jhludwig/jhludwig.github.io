[Fire and Fury](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Fury-Inside-Trump-White/dp/1250158060) by Michael Wolff.  Who knows if it is all true but it certainly reads true.  Most of the administration comes across as unprepared for the job and unwilling to dive in and do the hard work to learn the job.  Smells like Bannon is a major source, if Bannon had emerged triumphant this might have been a very different book.
