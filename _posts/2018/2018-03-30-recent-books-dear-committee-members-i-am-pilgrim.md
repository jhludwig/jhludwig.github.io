- [Dear Committee Members](https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Committee-Members-Julie-Schumacher/dp/0345807332) [![](images/dearcom-195x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2018/03/recent-books-dear-committee-members-i-am-pilgrim/dearcom/)by Julue Schumacher.  Hilarious and well executed, a series of recommendation letters from a university professor, each of which gets hijacked by events in his personal life.  Loved it.
- [I Am Pilgrim](https://www.amazon.com/Am-Pilgrim-Thriller-Terry-Hayes-ebook/dp/B00DPM90C4) by Terry Hayes.  Thriller tale of a super spy saving the world.  Nothing innovative but a great tale and an appealing main character.
