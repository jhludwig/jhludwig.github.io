- [Children of Time](https://www.amazon.com/Children-Time-Adrian-Tchaikovsky-ebook/dp/B07DN8BQMD) by Adrian Tchaikovsky.  [![](images/educated-197x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2018/09/recent-books-children-of-time-educated-fear/educated/)Award winner, and an interesting precept about a future human diaspora to the stars, but oh my gosh did it drag on.  Editor please.
- [Educated](https://www.amazon.com/Educated-Memoir-Tara-Westover-ebook/dp/B072BLVM83/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1537030752&sr=8-1&keywords=educated) by Tara Westover.  A nearly unbelievable memoir, an incredible story about rising up out of an impossible childhood filled with abuse and neglect.
- [Fear](https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Trump-White-Bob-Woodward-ebook/dp/B075RV48W3) by Bob Woodward.  The overall impression I get is more "chaos", there is no rhyme or reason to the operation of the Trump Presidency judging by this book.
