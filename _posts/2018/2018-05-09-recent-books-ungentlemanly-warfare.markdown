- [Churchill’s Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare](https://www.amazon.com/Churchills-Ministry-Ungentlemanly-Warfare-Mavericks/dp/1250119030/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1525443865&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=churchill%27s+ministry+of+ungentlemanly+warfare&psc=1) by Giles Milton. Deep dive into the British efforts to combat the Nazis with sabotage, resistance, even terrorism. Well done.[![](images/storied-300x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/?attachment_id=7744)
- [The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry](https://www.amazon.com/Storied-Life-J-Fikry-Novel-ebook/dp/B00GU2RLMC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525653955&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Storied+Life+of+A.+J.+Fikry) by Gabrielle Zevin. I picked this up at random on Independent Bookstore Day at [Elliott Bay Bookstore](https://www.elliottbaybook.com/).  Fantastic hopeful book about loss and love.  Great characters.  Very glad I took the chance -- what I really like about independent bookstores is their "staff picks" area.
- [March](https://www.amazon.com/March-Book-One-John-Lewis-ebook/dp/B00CTBU3NC) by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, Nate Powell.  Great graphic novel about the life of John Lewis.
- [Amatka](https://www.amazon.com/Amatka-Karin-Tidbeck-ebook/dp/B0716GNTTG) by Karen Tidbeck.  Another Independent Bookstore Day purchase.  A town whose very existence is defined and controlled by language, and what happens as some of the residents start to rebel against control and language.  A little trippy but I enjoy tales like these.
