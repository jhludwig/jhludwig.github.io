A great launch yesterday -- [Docusign IPO.](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b29aa2fb-5bb2-356c-8fac-6fa51b767a69/%5B%24%24%5D-docusign-shows-strong.html\)

Congrats to everyone there.  And a big congrats and thanks to [JonRo](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jonathan-roberts) who unflaggingly championed and supported the company through every zig and zag.  He taught me such valuable investment lessons about persistence and about survival -- he stuck with Docusign (and other investments) through every dip, through every tough spot, as they went in and out of fashion, and it all ultimately paid off for Docusign and Ignition investors.  Thanks Jon.
