- [Queenpin](https://www.amazon.com/Queenpin-Novel-Megan-Abbott/dp/1416534288) by Megan Abbott. [![52408-_uy475_ss475_](images/52408._UY475_SS475_-300x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/10/recent-books-queenpin-emerald-lie/52408-_uy475_ss475_/)Wow this was a fun noir tale of a young woman working her way up the seamy underside of the city. Really enjoyed it.
- [The Emerald Lie](https://www.amazon.com/Emerald-Lie-Taylor-Novel-Novels/dp/0802125468) by Ken Bruen. A detective tale of a sort, tho the detective basically is a drunk who stomps around like a bull in a china shop, not really solving crimes but creating havoc. Nice atmosphere.
- [The Sympathizer](https://www.amazon.com/Sympathizer-Novel-Pulitzer-Prize-Fiction/dp/0802124941) by Viet Thanh Nguyen. This was a bit of a chore, and at the end was very painful to read due to the intense subject matter, but a very good read about the complexity and senselessness of war. Certainly can understand why this novel got so many accolades, the writer has a very distinctive voice.
- [The Big Sheep](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Sheep-Novel-Robert-Kroese/dp/1250088445) by Robert Kroese. I guess this is was an attempt to do a Sherlock Holmes style story in a near future America, but eh, just read a Sherlock Holmes story.
