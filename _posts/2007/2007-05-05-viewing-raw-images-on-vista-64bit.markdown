Another Vista problem -- [Vista RAW image support getting better](http://techrepublic.com.com//5208-6230-0.html?forumID=102&threadID=221230&messageID=2225894 "Vista RAW image support getting better") -- despite the headline, you are screwed on 64bit Vista, the Canon and Nikon drivers won't work. Sucks.
