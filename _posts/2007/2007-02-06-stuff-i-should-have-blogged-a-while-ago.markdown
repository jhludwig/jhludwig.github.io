\* Need a new tiny PC for carrying around -- [OQO 2.0?](http://crunchgear.com/2007/01/08/oqo-02-its-alive/ ) One of the small Sonys? I don't need a desktop replacement, just something small for classroom/cafe use. If it is big, I won't carry it. \* Need to set up an [Amazon store](http://www.webmink.net/2007/01/mazing.htm). Maybe for Halloween. \* [Microsoft Robotics Software](http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_Robotics_Software_Out_of_Beta/1166030288) -- interesting, tho it requires download of so much crap. \* [Mic zooming HD cameras](http://crunchgear.com/2006/12/07/panasonic-adds-two-noise-zooming-camcorders-to-high-def-party/). \* [The annoying need for notepad paste](http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2006/11/the_annoying_ne.html). I do this and it's graphic friend "paintbrush paste" all the freaking time. \* [How to get slickrun to activate with Windows-R](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ScottHanselman/~3/55209893/HowToGetSlickRunToActivateWithWindowsR.aspx) \* [Photostamps](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001498.php). Personalized stamps. Another good halloween or xmas idea \* [Aboutus](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/49342056/). Intriguing.
