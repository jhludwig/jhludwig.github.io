Been tough to keep up with my coursework at UW this year -- they just don't have a deep distance learning curriculum, particularly in materials science, my interest area. Scanning the web for new options:

\* [Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering](http://www.distancelearning.ufl.edu/program.aspx?p=29 "Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering") -- Florida seems to have a prominent program but sigh, the gators. \* [Auburn](http://eng.auburn.edu/distance-learning/gop/programs/materials.html) as well \* [Purdue](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ProEd/credit/msie) \* [Texas A&M](http://distance.tamu.edu/futureaggies/distance-degrees/industrial-engineering.html)

Of course if I want to go self-paced and just learn material without worrying about a degree there is always [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Materials-Science-and-Engineering/index.htm) though at a graduate level the materials are often very thin -- someones lecture notes.
