Via [Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/14/reckoning-day-for-venture-capitalists/ "Reckoning Day For Venture Capitalists?"), [TheFunded](http://www.thefunded.com/) which tracks feedback on VCs by funded companies. This s awesome, more transparency and communication is always good. I note [Bessemer](http://www.bvp.com/) is rated highly, I'm on [a board](http://www.networkmagic.com) with some Bessemer folks and I would have to agree, they are great. I hope all the Ignition portfolio companies rate us, and rate us honestly.
