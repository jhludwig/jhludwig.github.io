Latest BCS standings -- [7385660\_37\_1.pdf (application/pdf Object)](http://msn.foxsports.com/id/7385660_37_1.pdf "7385660_37_1.pdf (application/pdf Object)") -- the voters are pretty much behind the Buckeyes. The computer polls are a little squirrelly -- I'll accept LSU ahead of OSU in computer polls, they have played some quality teams.

And maybe I can take BC, though this is debatable. Nonconf foes were Army, Mass, BGSU, and ND? Inconference was Wake, NC State, GT, VT. Is this really materially better than OSU's record?

But Kansas? Who played Central Michigan, SE Louisiana, Toledo, Florida Intl nonconference? and K State, Baylor, Colorado and Texas A&M in conference, with narrow wins over most of those? Does Sagarin factor in the coach's weight?
