Too late for this year but maybe next -- [Eric](http://www.ericmaffei.com/) recommends this -- [Laser Widow laser light show is battery powered and lights up the room with a cool home laser light show. - Disco Dj Party Lights Lasers](http://www.coolstuffcheap.com/laserwidow.html "Laser Widow laser light show is battery powered and lights up the room with a cool home laser light show. - Disco Dj Party Lights   Lasers") -- his notes: _"These projectors usually come with preset or sound-triggered patterns (stars / circles / lissajous, etc.) which they generate by bouncing the beam off of two tiny, rapidly spinning mirrors. I turn the sound activation off, then fiddle with the controls until I get a fixed- or pulsating-diameter oval. I mount the projector about five feet above the ground and aim it down our long driveway. With even a moderate bit of fog I get a great looking oval tunnel that's at least 50 feet long -- as victims approach via the driveway, their heads are right in the middle of the tunnel for quite a distance. (Getting the beam in someone's eyes is not really a concern since it's moving so rapidly.) The effect of the fog being "cross-sectioned" by the beam is quite something."_
