[Buckeye Legends | Game of My Life - Michigan (Part 2)](http://blog.buckeyelegends.com/2007/11/game-of-my-life-michigan-part-2/ "Buckeye Legends | Game of My Life - Michigan (Part 2)"): _That football’s about getting back up after you’ve been tackled. That it’s not about success or failure, but both at the same time. And the question isn’t whether either is permanent, but whether you choose to get up again, without fear or recrimination, after you’ve failed. Ad infinitum._
