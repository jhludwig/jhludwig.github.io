[OSU finally shows up](http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20070324_MEM@OHST). You had the sense that OSU had 4-5 chances to really put this game away and finally did. Not a perfect game, but certainly their most complete game. And nice to see [Dorsey shut up.](http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/story/10083226)
