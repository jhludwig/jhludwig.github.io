Not sure why Vista decided it needed to tell me this, but this forum provides tips on fixing -- [Microsoft Windows Search Indexer stopped working and was closed - Tech Support Forum](http://www.techsupportforum.com/microsoft-support/windows-vista-support/138952-microsoft-windows-search-indexer-stopped-working-closed.html "Microsoft Windows Search Indexer stopped working and was closed - Tech Support Forum") -- basically you have to manually delete all the temporary working files for search. You'd think Vista could do that for you. Possibly related to the fact that my reliability index is 1.97 and I am getting multiple blue screens a day -- thanks BioShock.
