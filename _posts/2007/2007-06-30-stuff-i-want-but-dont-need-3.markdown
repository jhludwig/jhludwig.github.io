\* Have to lead today's list with the [iphone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/). My lizard brain wants one. The rest of me has no idea why. I'm going to attempt to hold off until V2. \* [Toolmonger ? Blog Archive ? Magnogrip Magnetic Wrist Band](http://toolmonger.com/2007/06/30/magnogrip-magnetic-wrist-band/ "Toolmonger ? Blog Archive ? Magnogrip Magnetic Wrist Band") -- wow this actually seems super useful. \* [Nike floor hockey cleaning concept](http://crunchgear.com/2007/06/27/nike-floor-hockey-cleaning-concept/) \* [PuchiPuchi](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2007/06/pop_goes_the_puchipuchi.html) bubble wrap toy. Can you imagine having one of these on an airplane? \* Rich and Bob's advice for [lens cleaning tools.](http://www.tongfamily.com/camera_cleaning.php) \* [Phoneflasher](http://www.phoneflasher.com/flasher_core.html). Not sure I can pull this off. \* [Magnatag whiteboards](http://www.magnatag.com/). These appeal deeply to me tho I have no specific need. Maybe I can use one to manage my halloween efforts?
