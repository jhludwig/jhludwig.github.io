Installed this -- [An update is available that improves the compatibility and reliability of Windows Vista](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=938194 "An update is available that improves the compatibility and reliability of Windows Vista") -- as I was suffering from several of the named problems:

• The computer stops responding, and you receive a "Display driver stopped responding and has recovered" error message. You can restart the computer only by pressing the computer's power button. • The computer stops responding or restarts unexpectedly when you play video games or perform desktop operations. • There are stability issues with some graphics processing units (GPUs). These issues could cause GPUs to stop responding (hang). • Visual appearance issues occur when you play graphics-intensive games.

My machine didn't croak on install. So far, so good
