[Star-Telegram | 02/12/2007 | The next class fits in your pocket](http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/state/16680431.htm "Star-Telegram | 02/12/2007 | The next class fits in your pocket") -- for my next [UW EDGE](http://www.engr.washington.edu/edge/) course i need to investigate slamming the lectures onto the ipod. And if i jam the pdfs onto the sony reader, a lightweight remote course system that is pretty optimal.
