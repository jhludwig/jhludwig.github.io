Finally have had enough of Vista64 bluescreening on me. Probably due to crappy 64bit video drivers. Also tired of being unable to print.

So I wiped the hard disk of [my machine](http://www.pugetsystems.com/) today and started the install of XP 32bit. First challenge -- the XP install disk doesn't have drivers for a huge amount of my system, including the network card chipset on the [asus](http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us) motherboard. Downloading all the drivers now on a separate machine to burn onto a CD.

Make sure you have an exact and detailed list of all your hardware if you go this route so you can, like me, track down all the drivers. If I'd been smart I would have downloaded and burnt all the drivers before I did the reinstall.
