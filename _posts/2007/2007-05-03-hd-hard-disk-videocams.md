I'm really wanting one of these such as the [JVC GZ-HD7 Everio 60GB Hard Disk Drive HD Camcorder](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details&kw=JVGZHD7&is=REG&Q=&O=productlist&sku=479003 "JVC GZ-HD7 Everio 60GB Hard Disk Drive HD Camcorder") -- tho the [NYTimes review](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/technology/03pogue.html?ref=technology) today pee'd all over its image stabilization which seems like a real problem. The other mentioned in the article, the [Sony](http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=HDRSR7&CategoryName=dcc_DICamcorders_HighDefinitionVideo&DCMP=FROOGLE&HQS=HDRSR7), saves the video in some goofy format apparently which will create a pain of its own sort. I've been using my old camera a lot recently and transferring the video from tape to pc or dvd is such a pain, i am really motivated to move ahead, but not sure either of these cameras is the right jump.
