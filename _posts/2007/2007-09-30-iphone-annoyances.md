\* I really need this -- [The Missing Sync for iPhone - Synchronize Mac OS X and iPhone](http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_iphone.php/ "The Missing Sync for iPhone - Synchronize Mac OS X and iPhone") -- it is a bummer notes on the iphone don't sync with anything useful \* the new itunes store network connection in starbucks is a terrible implementation. Since i am not a paid user of the tmobile network, when i walk in a starbucks now, the itunes store lights up, but every other website dies because the tmobile connection is limited to the itunes store. this is terrible, i can't sit in a starbucks now and just browse the web, unless i go futz with network settings. really stupid. drives me out of the starbucks store. \* lack of select/copy/paste functionality in text fields is terrible \* really needs a todo list app
