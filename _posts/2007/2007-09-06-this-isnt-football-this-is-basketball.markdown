And sloppy basketball at that. [NCAA Football Team Stats - CBSSports.com](http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/gamecenter/teamstats/NCAAF_20070906_MITNST@LOU "NCAA Football Team Stats - CBSSports.com") -- almost 1300 yards of offense between the teams. and 5 fumbles, 2 ints in the game. 28 penalties and 328 penalty yards. Sloppy! I can't believe in Louisville as a top 10 team with this kind of play.
