Cool -- [Marginal Revolution: The Beauty Function](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/02/the_beauty_func.html "Marginal Revolution: The Beauty Function") -- algorithms to automatically beautify people.

It is one thing to see these developed someday as processing software tools. That will be nice. But I want this code jammed right into my camera, I want this to happen realtime -- I want all my pictures to look great. Or imagine stuffed into a mirror -- man retailers would love this, everyone would look awesome in the store when trying on clothes. Or even into your eyeglasses -- it would be a much happier world if we all thought everyone was more attractive.
