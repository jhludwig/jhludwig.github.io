Via [Rahul at JB](http://www.rp0229.com/blog/2007/02/16/interesting-post-on-hard-disk-failure-rates-via-all-things-distributed/), [All Things Distributed: On the Reliability of Hard Disks](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/02/on_the_reliability_of_hard_dis.html "All Things Distributed: On the Reliability of Hard Disks"). Fascinating. A 6-10% failure rate for hard disks, wow. Another great argument for redudant storage.
