Weekend hike was Mt Catherine, just past Snoqualmie Pass. Cold and rainy, must have been 45 degrees at the base early Sunday morning. This guy had a much better weather day than me -- [Mt. Catherine, WA](http://www.piap.com/photos/06152003/index.shtml "Mt. Catherine, WA") -- pretty much all I saw was cloud.
