[Vista Still Sucks, Pirillo Pissed](http://crunchgear.com/2007/07/16/vista-still-sucks-pirillo-pissed/ "Vista Still Sucks, Pirillo Pissed") -- in my case, my reliability index hovers at about 5 and I can drive it down arbitrarily low by running games. I have seen some slight improvement but if I had the time I'd be sidegrading to XP.
