Some books I've been reading to help me in my coursework:

\* "Quantum Mechanics Demystified":amazon. High ranking on amazon but really terrible as an introduction. Very little conceptual discussion, just lots of math wanking. Maybe useful as a reference. \* "Nonclassical physics":amazon by Harris. Fine text. Good mix of concept and math. Very good at explaining relevancy of concepts \* "Electronic properties of materials":amazon by Hummel. Good, a little stilted -- I first guessed it was written in the 40s. Also terse, but some very helpful explanations of lasers, of electrons in crystals, etc.
