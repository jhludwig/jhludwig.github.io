[Microsoft One-Ups Apple's IPod Engraving](http://www.physorg.com/news114112204.html "Microsoft One-Ups Apple's IPod Engraving") -- oh well that will hurt Apple share big time.

I don't really understand what MSFT is doing. Anyone who gets a Zune instead of an iPod under the tree is going to be sad. The consumer asset MSFT has is in the gaming space, people love their XBOXes, I don't get why MSFT isn't starting with a mobile game device and growing from that.
