A new field for me -- [.:: Attosecond Spectroscopy ::.](http://www.attoworld.de/publications/AttosecSpectro.html ".:: Attosecond Spectroscopy ::.") -- introduced to by a recent review article in Science magazine. Fascinating -- spectroscopy at the electron level, the ability to see electron changes as atoms bond, etc.
