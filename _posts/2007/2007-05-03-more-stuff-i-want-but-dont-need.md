I am sure there is a whole post to write about "what to do with your trailer hitch that you never use" \* [Brushed aluminum keyboard.](http://datamancer.net/vonslattkeyboard/vonslattkeyboard.htm) Awesome \* [Umbrellas for windy weather](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/really_good_umbrellas_for_really_bad_weather_6137.asp). \* [Programmable hair](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/hairy_displays_6104.asp).
