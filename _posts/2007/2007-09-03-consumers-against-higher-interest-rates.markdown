I don't know what R-67 is, but I've seen this group -- [Consumers Against Higher Insurance Rates](http://www.reject67.org/ "Reject R-67") -- running numerous inflammatory ads against it. Google reveals that one of these "consumers" is [State Farm](http://www.pdc.wa.gov/rptimg/Default.aspx?docid=1044692), who has given $284K to the campaign. Another is [Professional Insurance Agents of Washington](http://www.insurancenewsnet.com/article.asp?a=top_news&id=84581). Here's [the whole list](http://www.reject67.org/who.html) -- note that it is free for individuals to join, and they have a damn small list. And I wonder how many of these are employees/members of the insurance industry companies/groups?

The duplicity of this campaign pretty much convinces me to vote for R-67, whatever it is.

UPDATE: OK I don't know why this ticks me off so much, something about these monied interests wrapping themselves in the cloak of consumerism. You can browse all the [group's filings here](http://hera.pdc.wa.gov/wx/showResults.asp?AppName=PDC&AppDesc=PDC%20FILINGS&ShowThumbs=False&MaxDisplay=50&SortOrder=&ShowDocId=True&PromptForCheckOut=False&nFirstRecord=1&SortField='&SearchCriteria=%257E%257Efield9%3Don%26REPORT%2BTO%3D%26strAppName%3DPDC%26DESCRIPTION%252FPARTY%3D%26filt%3Dtrue%26%257E%257Efield5%3Don%26FORM%2BTYPE%3D%26ELECTION%2BYEAR%3D%26%257E%257Efield1%3Don%26BALLOT%2BNUMBER%3D%26%257E%257Efield15%3Don%26%257E%257Efield16%3Don%26FILER%2BNAME%3DList%253A%2B%2527CONSUMERS%2BAGAINST%2BHIGHER%2BINSURANCE%2BRATES%2527%26%257E%257Efield8%3Don%26LEGISLATIVE%2BDISTRICT%3D%26%257E%257Efield3%3Don%26%257E%257Efield4%3Don%26OFFICE%2BSOUGHT%3D%26%257E%257Efield6%3Don%26DATE%2BRECEIVED%3D%26REPORT%2BFROM%3D%26%257E%257Efield7%3Don%26Submit%2BCriteria%2Bfor%2BQuery%3DSend%2BQuery%26&batchnumber=) -- you will quickly see that real washington consumers have donated maybe $300 while insurance companies (mostly out of state) have donated millions and millions of dollars to this campaign. The group founders are not consumers but come from [this tort reform group](http://www.walrc.org/about/board-members.html). Here's some [Seattle news coverage](http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/davidpostman/archives/2007/06/25/) about the media buying from earlier this summer.
