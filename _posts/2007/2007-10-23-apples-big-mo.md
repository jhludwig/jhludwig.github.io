I certainly would not have predicted 15 years ago that Apple would have returned to such glory. [Apple's iPhone Builds Huge Lead in Customer Satisfaction - Seeking Alpha](http://seekingalpha.com/article/50765-apple-s-iphone-builds-huge-lead-in-customer-satisfaction "Apple's iPhone Builds Huge Lead in Customer Satisfaction - Seeking Alpha") -- they are building a huge lead in the cellphone space (thanks for the article Cam). Rich points out [their financials are awesome](http://www.tongfamily.com/apple_momentum.php), paced by mac sales, and they have a huge opportunity still ahead of them.

I had an Apple \]\[ a million years ago, I bought a Mac the first day they were on the market, it is great to see them do so well.

Meanwhile I am sorry as hell that I got sucked into Vista and particularly Vista 64 -- here is a [typical tale of woe](http://www.edbott.com/weblog/?p=1801) -- installing most software just doesn't work.
