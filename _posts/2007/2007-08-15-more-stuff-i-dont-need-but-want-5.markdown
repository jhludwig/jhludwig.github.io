\* [NITON XRF Analyzers for Toys & Consumer Goods](http://www.niton.com/Toys-Consumer-Goods-Screening-with-Handheld-XRF/products.aspx "NITON XRF Analyzers for Toys & Consumer Goods") -- I saw this on a news program, testing toys for lead. totally cool. $1000 to rent for a week so probably ridiculously expensive. \* [iStraw](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20070814/istraw-for-instant-clean-water/) -- well we just had a case of giardia in the extended family so this looks pretty good \* [Urwerk Watch](http://watchismo.blogspot.com/2007/08/urwerk-on-steroids-titanium-aluminum.html) -- another stupidly priced watch but awesome \* [Electric bike](http://www.metaefficient.com/archives/electic-bikes/yamahas-2000-electric-bike.html). Absolutely no need for this. \* [Two dimensional kid popup](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/twodimensional_kids_slow_traffic_7131.asp). This is a little disturbing for some reason. \* [Pie slice ejector](http://unclutterer.com/archives/2007/08/unitasker_wednesday_pie_slice.php). I only need this about once a year, but when you need it, you need it. \* [Hand made knives and tools](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/hand_made_knives_and_tools_7121.asp). I'm not sure how functional, but they are cool \* [Puke inducing flashlight](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2007/08/pukeinducing_flashlight.html). A thousand and one uses. \* [Your Personal Moon](http://www.bornrich.org/entry/bring-home-your-personal-moon/).
