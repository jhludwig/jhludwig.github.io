\* [Cymat: Home](http://www.cymat.com/ "Cymat: Home") -- metallic foams. Because they just look cool. The [resin coated version](http://www.alusion.com/product.html) would be a cool desktop. \* [Intensity vacuum](http://smallappliances.electroluxusa.com/node35.asp?ProdID=37007). The folding-up-ness is nice. \* [Kraft paper sofas.](http://www.molodesign.com/en/products/soft/softseating/paper.html) Because no one else will have one. Oh and their [felt rocks](http://www.molodesign.com/en/products/felt_rocks.html) look cool. \* [Floating Jellyfish](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2007/04/floating_jelly_fish_a_stunner.html) pool lights \* [Highgear adventureplus](http://www.gadgets-weblog.com/50226711/highgear_adventureplus.php) -- all the cool campers will snicker at you \* [A finger skateboard game](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20070423/the-plug-play-skateboard/). just strange. \* [Wallet optimized for cards](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001661.php). Why more of these don't exist puzzles me. \* [Non contact infrared thermometer.](http://toolmonger.com/2007/04/20/dealmonger-non-contact-infrared-thermometer/) Seems like a totally useless gadget to me. Will go in the drawer with my stud finders. \* [Rich on HD camcorders](http://www.tongfamily.com/hd_camcorders_1.php). OK I really need one of these. Really. \* [Clamp multimeter.](http://toolmonger.com/2007/03/23/dealmonger-a-clamp-style-multimeter-for-12/) nothing unique here, I just like these.
