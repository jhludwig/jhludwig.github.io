Another great Halloween. Hundreds and hundreds of visitors. Awesome weather.

A few notes for myself:

\* Pneumatics failed. Compressed died. Why? I don't think it was just an untimely compressor failure. I think there was some overload condition created by my load. \* I placed one skeleton over a blue yard uplight just randomly. It looked awesome! I should uplight all skeletons in blue next year. \* More i-zombie lightning controllers! Lightning is always popular \* More fcgs! I have a couple windows that would be great. Also Kurt recommended illuminating with a moving blacklight on a panning fan base.
