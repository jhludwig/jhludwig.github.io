I'm in like 10 different pools, my view on various pool managers:

\* [PicksPal Bracket 2007 - NCAA Tournament - March Madness](http://hoops.pickspal.com/Members/Results.aspx "PicksPal Bracket 2007 - NCAA Tournament - March Madness") -- easy to enter, a lot of ad content but not annoyingly so. Entire bracket on one page which is nice. \* [Sportsline](http://mayhem.sportsline.com/splash/mayhem/spln/opm). I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that they show you consensus pick info dynamically as you pick teams -- this is freaking awesome. OK the math is sometimes bizarrely wrong but still. My favorite. \* [Yahoo](http://tournament.fantasysports.yahoo.com/men). A fine choice. Not fancy but works well. \* [ESPN](http://games.espn.go.com/tcmen/frontpage). The worst. Abusive ad content -- in tooltips popups, in between regions as you fill in your bracket. I won't bother to fill in anymore at this site and i would certainly never host one here.
