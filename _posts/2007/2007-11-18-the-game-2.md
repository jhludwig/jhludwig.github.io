[Ohio State shuts down Wolverines in what could be Carr's final home game](http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071117/UPDATE/711170419 "Ohio State shuts down Wolverines in what could be Carr's final home game") -- Tressel is halfway to making up for the awful Cooper years.

Now we just have to watch the 4 teams ahead struggle to the finish line. My guess is WVU wins out, LSU drops one, and Oklahoma recovers to knock out the Mizzou/Kansas winner, thus putting OSU and WVU in the final. But a lot of football to play...
