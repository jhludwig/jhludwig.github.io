I'm not really a car guy, but need new tires and wanted good ones. J turned me onto [Tire Rack](http://www.tirerack.com/ "The Tire Rack - Your performance experts for tires and wheels") -- they do an awesome job of summarizing all the choices for your car model, including review and real usage data for the tires. Painless ordering.
