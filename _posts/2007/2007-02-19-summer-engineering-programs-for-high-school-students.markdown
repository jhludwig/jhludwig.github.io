Looking at some of these -- want a 1-2 week program:

\* [NC State](http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/summerprograms/index2.html). We've been to, it was pretty good, albeit a mite warm and sticky in the summer. \* [Arizona](http://www.engr.arizona.edu/sea/). \* [Michigan State](http://www.egr.msu.edu/future-engineer/programs/) \* [Colorado](http://ecadw.colorado.edu/engineering/hshi/index.htm) \* [Berkeley](http://www.nslcleaders.org/engineering.html) \* [Purdue](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/InfoFor/FutureStudents/visitUs/STEP) \* [Illinois](http://www.engr.uiuc.edu/wyse/EYO/index.html ) \* [Boston U](http://www.bu.edu/summer/program_high_school_students/summer_challenge/)

A somewhat stale master list of engineering summer programs is [up here](http://tbp.mit.edu/highschool/)
