- [The Price of Time](https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Tigner-ebook/dp/B07NXXYG1G) by TIm Tigner. What a crappy suspense story. Poor characters, poor plot, just bad. I don't know why I stuck with it, I am embarrassed.
- [Transitions](https://www.amazon.com/Transitions-Making-Sense-Lifes-Changes/dp/0738285404) by William Bridges. Much to think about in this book. I have certainly not been thoughtful about the transitions in my life and it is near time to start thinking about the remaining transitions ahead of me.
- [The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-D-D-Novel-ebook/dp/B01M0HPHR6) by Neil Stephenson and Nicole Galland. Fun time travel historical novel. A trifle long.
- [Dark Money](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Money-History-Billionaires-Radical/dp/0307947904) by Jane Mayer. Good book but it will be hard to finish. I knew that the Koch's and their ilk were amoral self-interested traitorous manipulative bas%#@ds but this really brings it home, it is hard to read. It is A-OK to have different views on issues in our society, but the way they have used their money to corrupt the system is sickening.
