- [Range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) by David Epstein. Strong argument that creativity, invention, excellence are driven by breadth of knowledge, not depth. Important to read, learn, use tools outside your focus area.
- [Lost in Math](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Math-Beauty-Physics-Astray-ebook/dp/B0763L6YR7) by Sabine Hossenfelder.  Great book about biases in modern physics.  I am no physicist but the lessons apply to every other field.  
- [Laurus](https://www.amazon.com/Laurus-Eugene-Vodolazkin-ebook/dp/B014C57RDQ) by Eugene Vodolazkin.  A sprawling tale of the life of a man searching for redemption in middle ages Russia.  Something in here for everyone.
