- [Collapse of an Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1086772.Collapse_of_an_Empire) by Yegor Gaidar. Good look at the unraveling of the USSR, it's inherent fragility, and the human costs of the unraveling. Recommended by my Russian friends.
- [The Ten Thousand Doors of January](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43521657-the-ten-thousand-doors-of-january) by Alex Harrow. Love stories wrapped up in a tale of many worlds. More touching than expected.
- [The Obstacle Is the Way](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18668059-the-obstacle-is-the-way) by Ryan Holiday. Might have been more meaningful earlier in life. At my advanced age, youâ€™ve probably learned most of these lessons.
