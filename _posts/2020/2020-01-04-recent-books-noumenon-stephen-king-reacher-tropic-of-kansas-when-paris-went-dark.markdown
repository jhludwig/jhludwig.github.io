- [Noumenon](https://www.amazon.com/Noumenon-Marina-J-Lostetter/dp/0062497847) and [Noumenon Infinity](https://www.amazon.com/Noumenon-Infinity-Marina-J-Lostetter/dp/0062497863) by Marina Lostetter. A space exploration trip returns to Earth after centuries away and can barely relate to the evolved human culture. And so on. Fun.
- [The Institute](https://www.amazon.com/Institute-Novel-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B07N943MFX) by Stephen King. Very average Stephen King. So still highly entertaining but not amazing.
- [The Midnight Line](https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Line-Jack-Reacher-Novel-ebook/dp/B06WP486XH) by Lee Child. Another Jack Reacher book, a very good one, dealing with a missing veteran who may be a criminal or a hero or both.
- [Tropic of Kansas](https://www.amazon.com/Tropic-Kansas-Novel-Christopher-Brown/dp/0062563815) by Christopher Brown. A fascist nationalist leader arises in the US in the 1980s. Years later we follow along as young rebels try to undo the damage. Very entertaining.
- [When Paris Went Dark](https://www.amazon.com/When-Paris-Went-Dark-Occupation/dp/0316217433) by Ronald Rosbottom. Paris during the WWII occupation -- what happened to the city and the citizens. Some dark times.
