- [Red Mountain](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Mountain-Novel-Boo-Walker-ebook/dp/B01MEEWFIC) by Boo Walker. Outside my normal interest range and for good reason, this is horrible. A Hallmark movie. Cloying, ridiculous.
- [The Wanderers](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Mountain-Novel-Boo-Walker-ebook/dp/B01MEEWFIC) by Chuck Wendig. Post apocalypse, zombies, nano-machines, AI, pandemic, white nationalists, climate change, conspiracies, this has it all. Long but I enjoyed it.
- [Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960) by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith. Very readable walk through the basic arguments for immigration. Might be a little simplistic but everyone should at least be informed on these arguments.
