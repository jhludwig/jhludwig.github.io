- [Slow Horses](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19191674-slow-horses) by Mick Herron. Great tale of intrigue inside MI5. Started a little choppy but then the story took off and the characters rose to the fore.
- [Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18378002-intuition-pumps-and-other-tools-for-thinking) by Daniel Dennett. I really thought I would like this, but too much "angels on the head of a pin" for me.
- [The Lies of Locke Lamora](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora) by Scott Lynch. What an awesome tale of a gang of thieves ensnared in conspiracy on top of conspiracy. Really fun read.
- [Solutions and Other Problems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51323365-solutions-and-other-problems) by Allie Brosh. At times funny, at times deeply sad, always very human. Some of the insights into dogs and pet owners are hilarious.
