- [An American Sickness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31253737-an-american-sickness) by Elisabeth Rosenthal. An anecdote-driven walk through the dysfunctional health care industry. Some enraging anecdotes, and some useful how-to's at the end. Would have liked even more data but overall a very useful read.
- [The Origin of Wealth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36602943-the-origin-of-wealth) by Eric D. Beinhocker. An excellent book, re-establishing the basis of economics and wealth from first principles, overturning a lot of the traditional economics I learned once upon a time. Very satisfying to see economics built up as emergent behaviors from the actions of individuals, and to see the incorporation of uncertainty, imperfect information, and iteration. Not a complete story but excellent.
