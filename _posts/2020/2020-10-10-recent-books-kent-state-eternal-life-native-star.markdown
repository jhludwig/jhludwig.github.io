- [Kent State](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50159458-kent-state) by Derf Backderf. The Kent State shootings stand tall in my memory, but I don't think I ever knew all the details of the events. This is an excellent telling of the story. Calling out the National Guard is almost never a good idea.
- [Eternal Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35667296-eternal-life) by Dara Horn. Explores that the idea that a very long life renders meaningless most life events.
- [The Native Star](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7236997-the-native-star) by M. K. Hobson. Fun adventure thru an 1800s America where magic is a normal thing. Perhaps not very differentiated ground but a fun tale nevertheless. Makes me want to read more in the series.
- [The Snakehead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6004724-the-snakehead) by Patrick Radden Keefe. Inside the illegal immigration trade for a period of the 90s. A rough trade, amazing what people will go through for a chance to better their lives and their family's lives.
