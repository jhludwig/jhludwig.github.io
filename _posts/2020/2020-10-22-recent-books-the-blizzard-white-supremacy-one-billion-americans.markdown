- [The Blizzard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25597172-the-blizzard) by Vladimir Sorokin. A book about a terrible storm written by a Russian author? I expected some serious gloom, but this story was trippy and strange. Memorable but weird.
- [Me and White Supremacy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46002342-me-and-white-supremacy) by Layla F. Saad. A challenging book, but I certainly need to be challenged on these issues. Very worth the time.
- [One Billion Americans](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50165554-one-billion-americans) by Matthew Yglesias. An interesting premise and some very good ideas. Needs a more thorough and detailed discussion and analysis but thought-provoking.
