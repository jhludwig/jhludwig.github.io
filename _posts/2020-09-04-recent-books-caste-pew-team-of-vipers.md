- [Caste](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152447-caste) by Isabel Wilkerson. Pretty damning. If you still somehow believe that America is the perfect embodiment of the "shining city upon a hill", this book will but that notion to bed. We have a lot of work to do.
- [Pew](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48717327-pew) by Catherine Lacey. I really liked the tone of this book, and the ambiguity of the ending has a certain appeal, but I think I would have preferred a bit more resolution.
- [Team of Vipers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42864445-team-of-vipers) by Cliff Sims. Ugh. Why did I buy this. Another Trump insider claiming "yes he is horrible, but I did my best to rein him in, and now I can tell you the truth in a salacious book that you can buy". A venal coward. Sorry I gave him a dime.
