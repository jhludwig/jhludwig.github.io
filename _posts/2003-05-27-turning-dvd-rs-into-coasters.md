Rich is learning how to create coasters from blank DVDs -- [Tong Family Blog: Depressed: DVD Coasters Galore](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_home_movies/000912.html "Tong Family Blog: Depressed: DVD Coasters Galore"). This has been my experience too -- at least one bad DVD for every good one created. Not unlike the experience of burning CDs about 3-4 years ago. Do I have to wait for 3 years for the PC hardware, drivers, and apps to all get shaken out? Or maybe I should just get a Mac.
