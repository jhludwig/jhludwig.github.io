Spent a good part of yesterday eradicating this [Virus](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=WORM_LOVGATE.G) from one of our machines -- it was pretty invasive. One virus removal tool was not enough, I had to do multi-passes and some hand scrubbing too.

This is on a machine that hasn't downloaded anything and has no email access. The only software that has explicitly entered it is game software -- I wonder if the new Counterstrike CD had a virus on it...
