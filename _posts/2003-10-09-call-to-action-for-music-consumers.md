Good call to action at [Due Diligence](http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2003/10/08.html#a389 "Due Diligence") -- let's not sit around whining about the state of the music industry -- let's hasten its decay! I'll add another point -- if you must buy cds, buy them used, don't send more money to the music companies.
