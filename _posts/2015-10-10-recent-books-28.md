- [The Red: First Light](http://www.amazon.com/Red-First-Light-Trilogy/dp/1481440934) by Linda Nagata. [![thered](images/thered.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/thered.jpg)Very nice near future novel tactical warfare, cyborg soldiers, hacking, ad tech gone crazy, etc.
- [Zero World](http://www.amazon.com/Zero-World-Jason-M-Hough/dp/0553391267) by Jason Hough. Started out nice with some speculations about a guilt-free mind-wiped assassin, but turned to crap quickly with a really stupid many worlds interpretation. Don't bother.
- [The House of the Scorpion](http://www.amazon.com/House-Scorpion-Nancy-Farmer/dp/0689852231) by Nancy Farmer. Yet another YA dystopian novel, tho this at least wasn't in the games/maze/stupid challenge space. Kind of forgettable tho.
- [Nemesis](http://www.amazon.com/Nemesis-Harry-Hole-Novel/dp/0062119699) by Jo Nesbo. Solid scandinavian mystery, the main character is an appealing misfit.
