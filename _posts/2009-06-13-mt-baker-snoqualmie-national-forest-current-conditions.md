Frustrating morning, up early and out to the trailhead but road chained off. [Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest - Current Conditions](http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/mbs/conditions/road-trail-conditions.shtml) is supposed to have current conditions, and you can also call the North Bend ranger station 425 888 1421. However they all claim the road is open but it was clearly chained off. Grrr. Try again next weekend.
