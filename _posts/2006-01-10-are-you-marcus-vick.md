The "[Are You Marcus Vick](http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/?p=1599)" poll. My favorite Q is number 6:

_6\. Your favorite color is:

a.) Periwinkle

b.) Red

c.) Why are you asking me this shit? What’s my favorite color? What kind of faggot-ass shit is that? Why are you asking me that when you know I’m strapped. Yeah, you heard me punk. D-Eagle strapped. You see this? That’s killin’ steel right there, son–back the fuck up with that color shit. That’s right, back. The. Fuck. Up. Now we got some respect going on here. What? What, huh?!? What!!!_
