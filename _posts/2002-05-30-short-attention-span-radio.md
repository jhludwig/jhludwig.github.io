**Short Attention Span Radio**. Tune to 95.7 here in the seattle market. the home of [quick 96](http://www.quick96.com/). sub-10 second snippets of songs, one after another, with a numerical tag announced for each. The most bizarre radio experience I have ever had.

Update: went off the air as fast as it came on. Replaced by KJR FM. a) I am sure this was all driven by economics I don't have visibility into. b) Man does this tell me that the way we allocate spectrum is nuts -- here is a piece of valuable spectrum that is being wasted away just because it is in the middle of the long-established FM band.
