**School Year Drawing to a Close**. Liz taking the [SAT IIs](http://www.collegeboard.com/) today -- Math IIc, Chem, Writing. Tough way to spend a saturday. Annie graduation weekend -- congrats! John has his Latin and Math finals on Monday -- I tested him by asking him "What is MCMLXI times XIV?"

He told me I was a dork.
