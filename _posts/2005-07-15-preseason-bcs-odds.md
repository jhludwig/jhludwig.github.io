Per the pros, [the Buckeyes have 7-1 odds of being the national champs](http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005313.php), behind only USC.

OK I love the Buckeyes, but their line play was not all that strong last season, [and per at least one ranking](http://www.collegefootballnews.com/Big_Ten/2005_Previews/2005_BigTen_Unitrankings.htm), they are not as strong as several of the other contenders in the Big10 this year. On either side of the line.

I have a hard time believing that the relative lack of line strength will result in the top finish in the Big 10, let alone the BCS.
