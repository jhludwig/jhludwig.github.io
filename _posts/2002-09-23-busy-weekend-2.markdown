**Busy Halloween Prep Weekend.** Busy busy making tombstones and other props -- I love foamboard and stonelook paint from Home Depot (I can't provide links as they don't seem to sell them online). While a lot of people recommended electric carving knives as the way to do the largescale cutting of foamboard, I found mine to be ineffective on the 2" thick foamboard I bought. Also been horsing around with small motors to use in props -- as recommended on some of the project lists pointed to on my [halloween blog](http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html), small appliance motors work great in a lot of projects -- for example orange juicer motors, easily available at [Value Village](http://www.valuevillage.com/corpsplashvv.html). You just take out the pressure switch and you have a nice cheap durable motor.
