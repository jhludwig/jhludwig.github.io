\* [Downloads: Fences is a Seriously Awesome Desktop Icon Organizer](http://lifehacker.com/5147316/fences-is-a-seriously-awesome-desktop-icon-organizer). This thing is pretty useful. Kind of like the "group items" feature in powerpoint. Wish there was a Mac equivalent \* [Free Disk Analyzer](http://www.extensoft.com/?p=free_disk_analyzer). Reasonable. \* [Ubiquity](http://lifehacker.com/5131562/ubiquity-sees-major-update-new-look-better-performance). Intrigued but not committed yet.
