[IO2Technology: Heliodisplay/ Interactive Free-Space Display](http://www.io2technology.com/technology/overview "IO2Technology: Heliodisplay/ Interactive Free-Space Display") -- these would be awesome for halloween. Though I bet I can achieve a good enough effect with fog and a projector -- in fact for Halloween purposes it would probably be better.
