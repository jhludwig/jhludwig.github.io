[Cool Hunting: Jahan Khalili's X-Ray Lamps](http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2006/06/jahan_khalilis.php "Cool Hunting: Jahan Khalili's X-Ray Lamps") -- ok I don't really want one of these lamps but I love the idea of getting old xray films and using them for halloween decorating -- obviously i want some human skeleton films. Not much on ebay or via google.
