[Graphene breaks speed record - nanotechweb.org](http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/tech/32570 "Graphene breaks speed record - nanotechweb.org") and [Scientists make 'Perfect" nanowires](http://www.physorg.com/news120313863.html). Intriguing. Wonder what could be done with nanoengineering materials and electricity transmission.
