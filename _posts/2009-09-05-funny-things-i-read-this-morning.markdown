\* [GM Chairman Scares Execs with Actual Expectations.](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/gm-chairman-scares-execs-with-actual-expectations/) \* [Wondermark on trip planning](http://www.edbott.com/weblog/?p=2615). Guilty. \* [Charting the Dow](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2009/09/annotated-dow/). Not sure this is supposed to be funny. How is this different than reading tea leaves or palmistry?
