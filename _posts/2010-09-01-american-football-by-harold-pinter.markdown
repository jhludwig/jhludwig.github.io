Season kicks off tomorrow, so let's class up the joint:

_**American Football by Harold Pinter**

Hallelullah! It works. We blew the shit out of them.

We blew the shit right back up their own ass And out their fucking ears.

It works. We blew the shit out of them. They suffocated in their own shit!

Hallelullah. Praise the Lord for all good things.

We blew them into fucking shit. They are eating it.

Praise the Lord for all good things.

We blew their balls into shards of dust, Into shards of fucking dust.

We did it.

Now I want you to come over here and kiss me on the mouth._

Awesome on so many levels. From "HaroldPinter.org":http://www.haroldpinter.org/poetry/poetry\_football.shtml, worth reading the discussion there.
