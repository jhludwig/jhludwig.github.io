Can't wait for the season to start.

To put a little damper on my enthusiasm tho -- [The buckeyes are already #3](http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005403.php) -- in football revenue. [The Sports Economist points out](http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_05_01__arch_file.htm#111711545198246615) that expenditures don't seem to correlate strongly with success though. But they don't negatively correlate with success either.

Either way, about 85 kids are generating $46M in revenue for the school, which is getting used up to support other sports, build nice facilities, and pay some big salaries to adults. I still have a problem with the morality of this, more of the money should flow to the benefit of the players on the team. Some small suggestions -- give the players 8 years of free tuition so that they can realistically get an education and play football. Or underwrite the tuition for the children of former players. Fund a modest disability insurance program for the players.

Anyway, kickoff is 17 days away...
