Per [KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington - Program Schedule](http://www.komotv.com/about/schedule "KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington - Program Schedule"), The Game is not in HD in Seattle. Even tho the Cal/USC game later in the day is. ?? Is this a Seattle problem only, is The Game on in HD anywhere?

UPDATE: got an email response from KOMO, it will be on in HD, their website just isn't correct. Whew.
