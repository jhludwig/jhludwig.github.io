**URL Remapping under IIS**. OK I am finding all the tools for this. [www.streamcatcher.com StreamCatcher](http://www.streamcatcher.com/index.htm) seems like a complete and supported product. The [ISAPI URL Remapper](http://www.newobjects.com/product.asp?Category=46&) is a lot cheaper but also seems more limited. There is also a tool from a company called ZmeY whose website seems a little confusing.
