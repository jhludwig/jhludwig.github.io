- [Lapham Rising](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/826283.Lapham_Rising) by Roger Rosenblatt. Kind of in the [A Man Called Ove](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18774964-a-man-called-ove) genre, with a little farce thrown in, a crotchety aging man comes to terms with his life.
- [Later](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54798175-later) by Stephen King. Less horror and more detective. King is pretty darn good at making you empathize with a character very quickly, I was very motivated to find out what happens.
- [The Book of Eels](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51938590-the-book-of-eels) by Patrik Svennson, Agnes Broomé (translator). Interesting look at eels and how they figured in the author's life. I had no idea eels were such a strange creature. And while it didn't always click for me, the writer's entwining of his own personal journey was a good effort to make the book connect on a more emotional level.
- [Too Far Afield](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35741.Too_Far_Afield) by Günter Grass. This book was too far afield for me. Written by a German for Germans, I could just never climb the hill of references and break into the story.
