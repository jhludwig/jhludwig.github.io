**Bluetooth pains.** Comments from [Bob Frankston](http://www.satn.org/archive/2002_11_10_archive.html#85668513) on Bluetooth. I have also heard that Bluetooth as a PAN is a bit problematic as it puts even more pressure on device batteries and puts even more hi-freq radiation near your skull. I wonder if this is true.
