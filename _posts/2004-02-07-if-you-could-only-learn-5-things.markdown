[Marginal Revolution: If you could only learn five things...](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/02/if_you_could_on.html "Marginal Revolution: If you could only learn five things...")...an interesting question. Calculus is on my list. But I'd have to put Physics in, probably in place of statistics. I'd drop programming and put in an Arts choice -- creative studio work, performing arts ok too. I'd probably just go with one piece of great literature, probably Shakespeare. And now I guess I'd add microeconomics as my fifth. Very tough to choose tho.
