Early BCS projections at [An early projection of the BCS rankings : Fanblogs College Football Blog](http://www.fanblogs.com/bcs_poll/007198.php "An early projection of the BCS rankings : Fanblogs College Football Blog") and [Rich Tellshow](http://www.tellshowbcs.com/index.html). Both in agreement that OSU will be #2 and in the championship game if the season ended right now. Hard to believe. But OSU has showed up for every game and taken care of business, unlike a lot of other teams.
