- [Entangled Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52668915) by Merlin Sheldrake. Gosh I wanted to love this book, and there are some fascinating snippets in it about the amazing role of fungi in our world and lives. But a little too much telling me what I should learn, and not enough examples and stories, which are the memorable and instructive elements.
- [Ammonite](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180270.Ammonite) by Nicola Griffith. Been sitting on my shelf for years, not sure why I never got to it. Great tale of settlement of an alien world, and how the world changes us. Great characters.
- [The Maltese Falcon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29999.The_Maltese_Falcon?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=qDAT8AV7uh&rank=1) by Dashiell Hammett. Just felt like I should read it given its classic status. Didn't love it, but fun to experience.
- [The Woman Upstairs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15701217-the-woman-upstairs) by Claire Messud. A woman going thru the full throes of a midlife crisis, lurching around as she more deeply examines and questions her life and relationships. I loved the ending, powerful.
