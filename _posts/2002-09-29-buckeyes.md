**Buckeyes**. Nice game yesterday -- good thing Maurice was back. But the offense had a little more depth -- Gamble played well, Krenzel started to hit receivers. The dispatch posts a nice [photo gallery](http://www.dispatch.com/news/sports02/sep02/osu-ind/index.php?template=dispatch) from each game by the way.

Two more games (Northwestern and SJ State) to work the kinks out before the brutal Penn State/Wisconsin back-to-back. That will be the measure of this team -- can they focus and put away these first two teams they ought to beat, and then survive two tough opponents back-to-back. If the Buckeyes are still undefeated on Halloween then they will be quite a team.
