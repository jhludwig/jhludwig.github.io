\* [Toolmonger Finds: Snap-on’s New Micro Pneumatics](http://toolmonger.com/2007/03/18/finds-snap-ons-new-micro-pneumatics/ "Toolmonger ? Blog Archive ? Finds: Snap-on’s New Micro Pneumatics") -- small pneumatic tools. \* [Yoggie](http://www.yoggie.com/), the miniature security appliance. Not sure why, it is just cool. \* [A bookshelf made of...books.](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/03/a_bookshelf_made_of_encyc.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890). Wonderfully recursive. \* The [linksys kiss](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20070315/linksys-kiss-1600-has-a-weird-name-but-its-a-cool-product/). Kind of a dvd player but with some media extender wireless goo whacked on the side. I wonder if 3 years from now anyone will still have a vanilla dvd player -- i wonder if we won't all have various combo devices (game consoles, media extenders, etc) instead. \* [Unbreakable screwdrivers](http://toolmonger.com/2007/03/14/test-to-destruction-stanleys-demolition-screwdrivers/) \* Wood case computers and peripherals -- [Suissacomputers](http://Suissacomputers.com), [Woodcontour](http://Woodcontour.com). Probably a really bad idea but cool.
