First down to Orting to meet up with [Adrian](http://www.smithstuff.net/) and watch some rockets fire. Some crappy weather, I couldn't stay long enough to see Adrian's rocket, but we saw lots of other cool rockets.

Lunch at [Burger King](http://www.burgerking.com/). They have new chicken tenders in the shapes of stars and lightning bolts. I don't even want to think about what we were really eating.

Then Paintball at [Splat Attack](http://www.splatattackonline.com/field/ "Splat Attack") -- a great place, nice people. A little hard to find -- print out the directions and follow them religiously, and have your windows rolled down so you can hear the rat-a-tat-tat of the guns.
