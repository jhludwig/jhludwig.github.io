[Spark Fires - Products ~ Fire Ribbon - Vent Free](http://www.sparkfires.com/products/fire_ribbon_VF.htm "Spark Fires - Products ~ Fire Ribbon - Vent Free") -- trying to decide if this is a good idea or not. Not sure how much heat it actually puts into the room. Kind of freaks me out to think you don't need any sort of venting at all.
