I've been doing the math in my head this weekend and here is some confirmation -- [ESPN.com - NCF - Road to the BCS](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?page=/bcsroad/1109 "ESPN.com - NCF - Road to the BCS") -- if OSU can pass LSU in the polls, it is likely OSU can leapfrop USC in the BCS standings. Since USC has a weak schedule going forward, and LSU has a tough schedule, this seems like OSU's best shot at the championship game. Of course there is the detail of OSU winning out against Purdue and Michigan.
