a lot of this goes right over my head -- [Beyond3D - Which was nice.](http://www.beyond3d.com/articles/directxnext/ "Beyond3D - Which was nice.") -- but i am struck by the amount of useful innovation happening in graphics processing. Seems like people have lots of ideas to soak up many more iterations of Moore's Law on the graphics side of my PC. Whereas the future for my CPU MIPs doesn't seem quite as innovative.
