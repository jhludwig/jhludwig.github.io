- [Noir](http://www.amazon.com/Noir-Novel-Robert-Coover/dp/1590202945) by Robert Coover. Noir mystery meets mushrooms. Very strange story. Engaged me but I'm not sure I'd want a steady diet of this.[![lastman](images/lastman-195x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lastman.jpg)
- [The Legend of Pradeep Mathew](http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Pradeep-Mathew-Novel/dp/1555976115) by Shehan Karunatilaka. Very nicely written, but ultimately defeated me. My lack of any cricket knowledge and lack of any Sri Lanka knowledge put me in too deep a hole.
- [The Secret Speech](http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Speech-Child-44-Trilogy/dp/0446402419) by Tom Rob Smith. Excellent pageturner, not surprising, Smith writes engaging tales.
- [The Trinity Six](http://www.amazon.com/Trinity-Six-Charles-Cumming/dp/B009LRMHZE) by Charles Cumming. Also a great pageturner, for some reason the hunt for moles inside the British intelligence community never gets old.
- [The Story of Edgar Sawtelle](http://www.amazon.com/Story-Edgar-Sawtelle-Novel-P-S/dp/0061374237) by David Wroblewski. I enjoyed, kind of an extended Greek tragedy set in rural Wisconsin. With dogs.
- [Y: The Last Man](http://www.amazon.com/Last-Man-Vol-Unmanned-ebook/dp/B0064W66EC) by Brian K Vaughan, Pia Guerra, Jose Marzan Jr. I don't read many graphic novels but this got such great reviews, and it is a great tale. Every male human and male animal dies off suddenly, except for one, and the race is on to save and recreate the world. This would be a fantastic TV show, tho I'd tame down some of the comic parts a little.
