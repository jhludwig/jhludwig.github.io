[![silvan](images/silvan-300x143.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/silvan.jpg)I sold most of my vinyl back in the early 90s, tho I held on to a couple dozen that meant something to me. This [artisan turntable from a local shop](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/898522200/silvan-audio-workshop) makes me want to get back into vinyl...
