[![bugs](images/bugs-300x225.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bugs.jpg)Been an awesome year for football. The unexpected run of the Buckeyes was legendary. And the Seahawks were awesome until that last fateful play last night. What a crushing way to lose.

And now sadly it is all over. March Madness is months away. Time to get some work done.
