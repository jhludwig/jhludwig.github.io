[SNUPI/Wallyhome cuts staff](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/seattle-startup-snupi-cuts-staff-shelves-wally-home-sensor-device/) -- sad to see a Seattle startup struggle, and these guys have some really interesting technology that has come out of Patel's work.

But I've always thought that remote sensing without video (and to a lesser degree audio) is uninteresting. The first thing you want to do when a remote event is triggered is see exactly what is going on. Without that, remote sensing is just kind of frustrating. I've tried Wally and Smartthings and every other kind of remote sensor, the only thing that has stuck is Dropcam because it lets me see what is going on.

It is why cameras and video is at the heart of what we are doing at [Surround.io](http://www.surround.io) -- vision is fundamental, and solving the hard scale issues of video processing, storage and transmission puts you in a great position to deal with other types of sensor data.
