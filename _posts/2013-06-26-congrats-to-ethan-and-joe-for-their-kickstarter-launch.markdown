I'm a backer of [the Poppy](http://kck.st/12pALEG) -- I went for the microfiber bag level. Great to see a Seattle team doing well.

And what the heck, while I was at it, I backed the [Openbeam Kossel Pro 3d printer](http://kck.st/11KVrxM) -- another Seattle team. I saw this printer at the mini Maker Faire here, it looks totally awesome.
