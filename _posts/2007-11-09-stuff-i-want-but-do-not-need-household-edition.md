\* [Ping Pong Door ? Coolest Gadgets](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20071104/ping-pong-door/ "Ping Pong Door ? Coolest Gadgets") -- just a concept now I guess. \* Another concept -- [mobile phone/tv remote combo](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20071025/telemax-iii-combines-remote-and-phone/). I love this idea. Not sure I like this particular form factor but the concept is great. \* [Response Kettle](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20071015/kenwood-response-kettle-changes-color-as-it-boils/) -- cool!
