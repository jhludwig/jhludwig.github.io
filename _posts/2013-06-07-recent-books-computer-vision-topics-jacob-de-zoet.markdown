Trying to get smarter about image processing and computer vision -- kind of a random walk of books:

- [Digital Image Processing: An Algorithmic Approach Using Java](http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Image-Processing-Algorithmic-Introduction/dp/1846283795/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370612396&sr=8-1&keywords=Digital+Image+Processing%3A+An+Algorithmic+Approach+Using+Java) by Burger and Burge. Mix of theory and implementation on the most basic of image processing techniques. A nice starting point.
- [Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-OpenCV-Practical-Computer-Projects/dp/1849517827/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370612195&sr=8-1&keywords=mastering+opencv) by Baggio etc. Heavy on samples, light on theory, but still useful.
- [Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision](http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Geometry-Computer-Vision-ebook/dp/B00AKE1QK4/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1370611518&sr=8-1) by Hartley and Zisserman. Heavier on theory. You'd better enjoy math.

Also for break from tech:

- [The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet](http://www.amazon.com/The-Thousand-Autumns-Jacob-Zoet/dp/0812976363/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370612541&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Thousand+Autumns+of+Jacob+De+Zoet) by David Mitchell. Liked Cloud Atlas (the book, never saw the movie), and so far really liking this. Great characters and does an excellent job of placing me into Japan in the year ~1700.
