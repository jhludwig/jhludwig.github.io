[CFN's Big Ten Preview is up](http://cfn.scout.com/2/882151.html). OSU gets the requisite amount of love. Though OSU needs some defensive players to surprise to achieve the promise of the team.

[OSU picked to finish first](http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/072709aaa.html) at Media Day.

Here are my hopes for the season: \* OSU of course defeats SC and goes on to win the Big10 \* Michigan takes steps towards respectability. You can't have the best rivalry in sports if one of the programs sucks. \* Someone rises in the west to challenge USC. \* UW gets up off the mat and makes some progress. \* Florida and Tebow take a dive. I am so sick of the Tebow-gasm in the press every day. My 2nd favorite team every weekend will be whoever is playing Florida.
