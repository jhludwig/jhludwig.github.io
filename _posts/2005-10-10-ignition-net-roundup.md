\* [Jason on the future of the online job market.](http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/10/the_not_so_dist_2.html) Right or wrong, it is smart to have some view of the future of your market. \* [Mark Maunder,](http://www.ziptree.com/) another jobster blogger \* [Livemarks](http://sandbox.sourcelabs.com/livemarks/) from [Sourcelabs](http://www.sourcelabs.com)' Alex Bosworth. Great great view of what content people are tagging. A great way to stay on top of hot content. \* Phil keeps on expanding Berry 411 -- [now restaurant referals](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/10/berry-seattle-restaurant-picks/). Seems like the [Judy's Book](http://www.judysbook.com) folks should collaborate with Phil. \* Also Phil has yoked Berry 411 to the [google mobile reformatter](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/10/googles-new-xhtml-mobile-reformatter/). Amazing how Phil is making Berry 411 the best browser for the blackberry -- all in his spare time. \* [johnza's analysis of newsgator](http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/10/06/newsgator_as_platform_play.html) -- newsgator seems to be doing a great job -- great investment by [brad feld](http://www.feld.com/blog/) \* [Hooper playing coy about MVNO investment.](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/243920_theinsider10.html)
