[![npr](images/npr.jpeg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/npr.jpeg)Love this list of [best albums from NPR](http://www.npr.org/2014/12/08/368731400/npr-musics-50-favorite-albums-of-2014). So much more useful than most of the discovery features in Spotify. Though NPR does have some pretty useful playlists up there.
