[Dead Address Book Entries](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2008/04/dead_address_bo.html) -- I struggle with this too. My last grandparent, Cleo, passed on a while ago and I have been unable to delete his email address from my address book. I see it, and I remember him, and my other grandparents, and I just can't remove it. I suppose some day my address book will be full of similar entries.
