**Jim Allchin vs Google**. I have to agree with [Frank](http://www.boosman.com/blog/) -- Jim's comment struck me as a little over the top. I think Jim meant well but this comes across as incredibly insulting to Google and very egotistical. I am sure the Google guys feel all warm and fuzzy this morning about Microsoft and Longhorn.
