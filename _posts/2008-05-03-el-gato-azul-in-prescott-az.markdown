[El Gato Azul :: 316 W. Goodwin St. Prescott AZ ::](http://www.fourcornersrestaurants.com/El%20Gato%20Azul/El%20Gato%20Azul%20Homepage.html) -- awesome tapas place with great margaritas and a great creekside location with indoor or outdoor dining. live music. we had a great time. PS Google Maps and Hertz EverLost both have the wrong location for this restaurant. 316 West Goodwin is right -- about a block and a half west of town square on Goodwin.
