Is this the year of speech recognition? GigaOM thinks speech recognition is getting ready to take off -- [Is Speech-Recognition Technology Finally Ready for Prime Time?](http://pro.gigaom.com/2009/08/is-speech-recognition-technology-finally-ready-for-prime-time/)

IN 2006 AnandTech had similar headlines -- [Speech Recognition -- Ready for Prime-Time?](http://www.anandtech.com/multimedia/showdoc.aspx?i=2744&p=1)

CNN called it in 2001 -- [Speech Recognition Technology will hear you now](http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/06/06/auto.speech.idg/) -- "After years of hype and false starts, automated speech recognition (ASR) technology is ready for prime time"

[SpeechTechMag made the claim in 1999](http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/Editorial/Feature/CALL-CENTERS-%3CBR%3E-The-Business-Case-for-Speech-in-the-Call-Center-29594.aspx) -- Speech recognition technology is "ready for prime time"

Apparently Comdex buzz in 1998 was that [1999 would be the year of speech recognition](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/0,1000000091,2069961,00.htm). Again.

At one point in the mid/late 90's, the Microsoft Speech Recognition team worked for me thanks to a reorg. All great people, very enthusiastic speech supporters, and convinced that widespread speech recognition was right around the corner. I loved the team but it seemed apparent that the hardware and software were both generations away from achieving useful speech recognition and so ultimately I worked to get the team moved to Microsoft Research.

So call me a skeptic. Over the past 15 years, you would have done well to always bet on "No" as the answer to "Is this the year of speech recognition?" I don't see a lot of reason to change the bet. Speech is tough, we are demanding, we expect a system to respond to conversational input -- rapid, lots of colloquialisms, speaker-independent, etc. Yes there are systems that can respond reasonably well to very limited inputs but as a general use technology, I'm not yet optimistic.
