**Gulf Islands**. Just back from an 8 day trip in SW British Columbia. A couple days in Vancouver, a couple in Victoria, and a bunch in the middle in and around the Gulf Islands. [Ganges](http://www.vancouverisland.com/002regtown/towns/index.asp?townID=257) is a nice little town. Sydney has a beautiful harbour. The baby beluga at the [Vancouver aquarium](http://www.vanaqua.org/) was great.

I used our new Kodak DX4900 4Mpixel digital camera with the Easyshare dock. I really love the dock, recharging and downloading pictures is way easier than with past cameras I've used.
