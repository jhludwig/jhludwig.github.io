**Online Federal Tax payment**. Tong points towards [this site](http://www.eftps.gov/) as the new age way to pay your taxes. But what is with the big disclaimer to not bookmark the site???? Are we supposed to remember this URL by heart? If we can't bookmark it, am I allowed to write down the URL or blog it? Strange.
