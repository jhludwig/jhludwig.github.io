- [Tangle of Wires: Jack o'lanterns in the tree](http://tangleofwires.blogspot.com/2008/12/jack-olanterns-in-tree.html). Does look nice.
- [Zoybar](http://www.zoybar.net/). Seems like it might be a nice way to build some sound fx
- [Tinker Store](http://tinkerlog.com/2008/11/28/tinker-store-is-online/). I kind of like the firefly kit
- [Prop Documents](http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/FreeProps.html) via [Makezine](http://www.makezine.com). Nice to spread around possibly
- [Extreme foam cutting](http://www.core77.com/blog/technology/modelmakers_and_students_rejoice_cut_foam_with_ridiculous_precision_11769.asp). Learning how to work with foam is job one for halloween construction
- [Vintage poison labels.](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/11/vintage_poison_labels.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890) Very useful for mad scientist labs
- [Kurt's handiwork this year](http://www.grimvisions.com/halloween/pictures-from-halloween-2008). All his stuff is awesome
- [Paintings that watch you](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/11/the_painting_that_watches.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890). One way to build this.
- [Free sound mod software](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/10/spooky_and_free_audio_eff.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890). May be too late on this one
