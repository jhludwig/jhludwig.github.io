I drink coffee. I am addicted to crosswords. Hence [the perfect contest for me](http://www.starbucks.com/retail/crossword.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1) -- win a cup of coffee a day for 50 years. I finished today's first puzzle -- not very hard -- the equivalent of a monday or maybe tuesday NY Times puzzle -- I wonder if they are going to ramp up.
