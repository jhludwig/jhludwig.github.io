\* [New Monad build available](http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/06/new_monad_build.html) -- intriguing. Wish it worked for web content -- Wish you could plug [yubnub](http://feeds.feedburner.com/JohnBattellesSearchblog?m=615) commands into it. \* Installed: [Microsoft's RAW Image viewer](http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/1073/microsoft_raw_image), [Autoruns](http://www.larkware.com/dg3/TheDailyGrind646.html) (another tool for understanding startup processes) -- both worthwhile. \* Congrats to [Trumba](http://www.trumba.com) team for shipping. \* MT plugins and mods I should be trying out: [eliminating plugin envelop errors](http://www.movalog.com/archives/plugins/plugin-envelope-errors/), [tagging plugin](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/06/09/MovableTypeTaggingPlugin.html), [mt-protect](http://www.movalog.com/archives/plugins/protect/mt-protect-10/) (i REALLY need this functionality), [mt-blogroll](http://www.movalog.com/archives/plugins/blogroll/mt-blogroll-202/) (i'm tired of pageload latency due to blogrolling.com). \* Phil keeps cranking on [berry411](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/06/announcing-berry-411-v23-with-search.html). the guy is amazing.
