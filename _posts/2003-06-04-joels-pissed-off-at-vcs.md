[Joel on Software - Fixing Venture Capital](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/VC.html "Joel on Software - Fixing Venture Capital") -- hey I'm pissed at Joel because he didn't list my blog or tong's blog as examples of vc blogs.

Seriously it is a good thoughtful piece from an entrepreneur. If Joel was in Seattle I'd take him to lunch and learn more. I don't think we've done any of the things that he considers most heinous (like a no-shop) but he may have a point about the fundamental misalignment on risk. Tho I am not sure it plays out today like he suggests -- I don't think I've ever heard anyone at our firm telling a startup to spend more, faster.
