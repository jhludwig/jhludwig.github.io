**Floating Lantern**. Got mine built and trialed yesterday -- [Floating Lantern](http://members.accesstoledo.com/kkrazykkaren/Floating/Lantern.html). Very nice looking. I downsized a little and used a different lantern and lamp element but otherwise pretty much per these plans. I think i'd like a little higher rpm motor given the smaller diameter of the effect but it still looks good.
