\* "Persepolis":amazon by Marjane Satrapi. A very quick read, graphic novel format. Excellent true tale of growing up in post-revolution Iran, presents a lot of stunningly tough situations but in a way that is readable.

\* "Avalanche: A Sheriff Bo Tully Mystery":amazon by Patrick McManus. Great yarn about a smalltown sheriff and murder. Great characters throughout, I would happily read more.
