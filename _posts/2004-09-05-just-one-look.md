[Just One Look](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0525947914/qid=1094419771/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/104-9987463-4257565?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Just One Look") by Harlan Coben is the first I've read by him, and it was pretty gripping. OK not that original -- an ordinary family's life comes unwound when a secret from the past surfaces; not everyone is who they seem to be; eventually the cops, US Attorney's office, and organized crime families are all drawn in. But nicely paced and interesting characters. The resolution is a little weak but still a good yarn, I'd pick up more by Coben.
