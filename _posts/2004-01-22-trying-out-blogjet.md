Trying out blogjet on Marc's reco -- [Marc's Outlook on Productivity: More on Blogjet](http://blogs.officezealot.com/marc/archives/000198.html "Marc's Outlook on Productivity: More on Blogjet") -- it is nice. But it doesn't really work for me because it assumes you want your post content in a separate paragraph than your title, which is not how i format my entries -- for short entries like mine, this creates far too much whitespace for my eye. The lack of underlying code access means I can't easily fix this. So I have to pass on blogjet.
