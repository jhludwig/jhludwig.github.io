**Dad update**. He continues to do well. Physically making good strides. Is up occasionally today, and is eating solid food (though, as his roommate says, everything tastes like dirt). He is not feeling the most settled today, painkillers and anesthetics are taking their toll, but he looks better and is getting better.
