\* Via [Rahul Pathak](http://www.rp0229.com/blog/2007/02/10/iteration-speed-vs-iteration-quality-via-coding-horror/ "Iteration Speed vs. Iteration Quality (via Coding Horror) at Starting Up by Rahul Pathak"), [Boyd's Law of Iteration: speed of iteration beats quality of iteration](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000788.html). Great pithy maxim. Doesn't apply so well to heart surgery or parachuting, but really valuable for domains in which the cost of and individual failure is relatively low. \* And [Dave says](http://www.naffziger.net/blog/2007/02/05/when-you-understand-a-market-opportunity-is-everywhere/) "When you understand a market, opportunity is everywhere". Again so true in so many domains -- deep understanding yields insights.
