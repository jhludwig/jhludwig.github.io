Interesting article in [Sunday's NY Times re Steve Case](http://www.wilmingtonstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050619/ZNYT01/506190386/1004/Local) and areas of interest for healthcare investing:

_

\* Online reviews and rankings of doctors and hospitals. \* Information and breaking news about medical ailments and treatments. \* Software and tools that let people manage their medical records online. \* Health "concierges" or "coaches" who help patients navigate the medical system. \* Walk-in medical clinics where, say, in 15 minutes and for $39, you can discover whether your child has an ear infection.

Near and dear to my heart.
