OK it is not [Hyperion](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553283685/qid=1076390789/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-8005787-9107304) but [Ilium](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380978938/qid=1076390723//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-8005787-9107304?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Ilium") is a darn good book. I finished it in about 3 days, engrossing. I know absolutely no Proust, and not enough classic Greek literature or Shakespeare, but I still found this book engrossing and am dying for the follow-on volume. But if you have never read Simmons before, go read Hyperion first; the Shrike has stuck with me the way few characters (or whatever) have.
