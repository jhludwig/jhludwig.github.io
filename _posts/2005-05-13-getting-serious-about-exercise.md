I had my annual physical this week (man I am glad we signed up for [MD Squared](http://www.md2.com/md2.html)) and while I am generally healthy, I weigh 3 pounds more than last year. Maybe not a big deal, but I already weigh too much, and if I extrapolate 3 pounds a year -- well this is what's going to kill me.

A big reason for this is that I basically don't exercise as I find it boring (I guess an early death will be even more boring!). So I need to remedy this. And I need a goal that I care about.

So I'm dusting off a [goal that I set four years ago](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000602.html) and have made no progress towards -- backpacking significant portions of the pacific crest trail. I need to get in good enough shape to carry a 60-70 pound pack for 5-6 hours a day, for 10-15 days, through up and down terrain, and still have the energy to cook, set up camp, etc.

Step one -- get comfortable hiking extended periods of time through tough terrain. I got new boots at rei -- some [zamberlans](http://www.rei.com/product/47570069.htm?) \-- and went on a 2 hour hike this morning to start to break in the boots and get my feet toughened up -- [Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park](http://www.metrokc.gov/parks/rentals/pommar99.htm) is close to home, has 36 miles of trails with a mix of inclines, and has a Nike missile site! Found my first blister-prone spot.

I'm going to keep this up. I'll spend the rest of this summer getting into a regimen that I can sustain -- the most important short term goal is accomodate excercise in a sustainable way into my schedule, if I am not still on a program in 3 months I am in trouble.
