On the first page, apps I use every day, multiple times:

\* Some of the default Apple apps -- Mail, Text, Calendar, Safari (all on the bottom row); Weather, Stocks, Maps, Camera, Calculator (a recent promotion back to the first page, the landscape mode scientific calculator is handy now that I am taking courses at UW again), Settings (purely to switch radio on/off for flights), Clock (for alarm and cooking timing), Phone. \* Facebook, Tweetie, Todo (synched with rememberthemilk for todo list management), Tripit (awesome for quick access to trip details -- flight status, checkin codes, etc), Wordpress for blogging, Amazon.com. OK Amazon is probably going to fall off soon, I don't do that much ordering while on the iphone. \* 2 Across for nytimes crosswords, and Mafia Wars. Mafia Wars is fun tho the math in the game is kind of whack.

On the second page -- apps that i need regular access to, or apps that I am trying out:

\* App Store, Shazam (tagging music that I hear on the radio/etc), SmugShot (for access to my photos), MiGhtyDocs (google docs access) \* Kayak and Flight Update tho they are declining is use thanks to the Tripit app \* Pandora tho also declining in use as I am getting new music via other mechanisms \* Trying out: Yelp, Air Sharing, SimpleMindX, FS5 Hockey, FriendCast, fring.

On the third page -- apps I keep around because I have to or because I need them occasionally:

\* Apple default apps Notes, Contacts, Photos, iTunes, iPod, YouTube. Can't delete them, they have to go somewhere \* Urbanspoon, GuitarToolkit -- great apps but I don't currently use that often. I tend to use google maps for finding restaurants instead of urban spoon \* Wine Guide, Starmap, Drinks Free, Clinometer, Remote, Google Earth, RTM, Snaptell. All interesting but I rarely find a reason to use. RTM is just not as good as the Todo app

On the fourth page -- games that I liked at one point but that are basically ignored now:

\* Tetris, Trism, Bejeweled 2. I'll still play bejeweled every once in a while \* Vector Tanks, iShoot. \* Pb Dreams, Flick Bowling, Monkey Ball, XOFootball. \* Edge, touchPhysics, Koi Pond, Topple, Rolando, newtonica2. All cute. \* Black and White. Pretty poor Othello game. \* Dr. Awesome. Awesome actually.
