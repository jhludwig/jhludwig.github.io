**Sun Launches 'Plan B".** Sun is going to work harder to get [PC OEMs and endusers to install their JVM](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,0,867743,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535). Duh. This should have been their plan A all along. Obviously PC OEMs are willing to ship a lot of software -- look at all the shovelware that comes on a new PC. The fact that they haven't been willing to ship the JVM is really telling -- it is saying that a Java VM is more useless than every other piece of cruddy software that they ship -- this is truly stunning given the quality of some of the shovelware. Sun should listen to OEMs and build a few Java apps that actually solve some interesting OEM problems, and then every OEM would take the apps and the VM.
