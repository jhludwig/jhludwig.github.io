OK nothing that educational here, just some fun reading.

\* [The Vanished Man](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743437810/qid=1094096485/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/104-9987463-4257565?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) by Jeffery Deaver. My first Deaver, I wasn't that impressed with the main characters in the series, Lincoln Rhyme and buddies. But a well crafted story that kept the action moving along.

\* [Blind Lake](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765302624/qid=1094096609/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/104-9987463-4257565) by Robert Charles Wilson. Great characters, a good story. The characters had real human depth, they weren't just set pieces moved around for the purposes of the plot. And the story raised and explored big questions, without feeling the need to provide a metaphysical explanation of the entire universe as is lamely attempted by so many science fiction novels.
