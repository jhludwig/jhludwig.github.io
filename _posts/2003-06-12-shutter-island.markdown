Just finished [Shutter Island](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0688163173/ref=pd_bxgy_img_2/002-5323723-7644812?v=glance&s=books). Great book, would be a good movie (some plot points similar to this year's [Identity](http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/identity/)). I see that [Mystic River](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380731851/qid=1055461439/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-5323723-7644812?v=glance&s=books&n=507846), Lehane's earlier book, will be a [movie](http://mysticrivermovie.warnerbros.com/) later this year with a strong cast.
