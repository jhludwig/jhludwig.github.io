Boy I am not convinced that the Netgear SC101 net storage box is the way to go -- i [got past my install problems](http://www.theludwigs.com/2005/12/netgear_sc101_problems.html) but the behaviour of the system is really funky. Windows just doesn't expect drives to have the file system locally and block storage remotely. Strange things I have seen -- Windows thinks these are removable drives and tries to autoplay them; iTunes thinks it doesn't have write access to the files; the Add or Remove programs cpl doesn't work anymore, never enumerating programs. I'd approach this one with caution.

Martin went with [a LaCie box](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/12/buying_nas_this.html) -- 2TB sounds great. I used to have a NAS box but was unhappy with the bugs in the old version of Samba it was shipping with -- Martin's box has Windows in it.

And then there is [this Buffalo box](http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/1754/buffalo_expands_its).

I'm using the Netgear box as my "master" store right now, but then using [beyond compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/) to copy much of the data around to all the pcs. And using foldershare to dupe critical stuff (photos) to a machine at work.
