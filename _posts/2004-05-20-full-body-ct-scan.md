I'm unfortunately at the age at which I need to worry a little more about heart disease and other issues. This week I went to [Health-Scan](http://www.health-scan.com/index.htm "Health-Scan") and had a full-body CT scan. What amazing technology, what a great experience -- walk thru your entire body organ by organ, artery by artery. I'm glad to report my arteries are clean as a whistle and everything else looks good too!
