[JD's New Media Musings: September 14, 2003 Archives](http://www.jdlasica.com/blog/archives/2003_09_14.html#001557 "JD's New Media Musings: September 14, 2003 Archives") -- of course this will happen, I scanned all the software choices this weekend for more private file trading (purely for personal non-infringing backup use in my home) and it is going to be easy to go dark.  
  
I saw a quote from David Bowie this weekend in the NYTimes where he said (from my memory, forgive any misquote) "in the future, recorded music will not be a moneymaker, but be an advertisement for live performances by the artist".  
  
Finally, [Mitch Kapor](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000383.html) points to this quote by Adam Eisgrau -- _"it's time for the R.I.A.A.'s winged monkeys to fly back to the castle and leave the Munchkins alone"_
