Up at fanblogs -- [NCAA College Football - Fanblogs.com: October 6 BCS Projections](http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/archives/000431.php "NCAA College Football - Fanblogs.com: October 6 BCS Projections"). Everyone plays [tough games this week](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/scoreboard?season=2&week=8&year=2003) as we enter the meat of the conference schedules, will certainly be some dramatic changes in this come next monday.

[Rich Tellshow's projections](http://www.geocities.com/rtell/bcs.html) are worth looking at also -- he has a full strength of schedule model, I do not.
