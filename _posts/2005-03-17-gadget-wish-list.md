Gadgets I've noticed lately...

\* The [keyboard organizer](http://www.keyboardorganizer.com/product.htm) -- i need the XL model \* The [Keyscan](http://www.keyscan.com) keyboard/scanner combo -- I think I would seriously scan more often if the scanner was this close at hand \* A [keyboard/pc](http://www.openlabs.com/products/product_info-neko64.htm) -- the other kind of keyboard \* [Yamaha YSP-1](http://www.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php?masterid=7368171&search=yamaha+ysp-1) -- surround sound from a single component. \* The latest ipod accessory -- [your house.](http://www.sonance.com/subs/products.php?category_id=72&option=get_category&thread_one_cat_id=29&thread_one_cat_name=Electronics&thread_two_cat_id=&thread_two_cat_name=) \* Siemens' [wearable whole-house remote](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/household/siemens-develops-combadge-home-communicator-036340.php) -- great for my Halloween setup \* Hey I have every freakin' ipod you can buy, so the [ipod phone](http://www.betanews.com/article/Motorola_Expect_Several_iTunes_Phones/1110472684) is a natural. By the way you have to love Apple's iPod support policy -- my iPod Photo was acting flakey, they gave me a new one, no questions asked. \* [Sam](http://www.mckelvie.org/) loves [the new slimp3 player](http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/688/slim_devices_rocks) (nice blog sam). \* [Tunable glass windows to block selective radio transmissions](http://www.netstumbler.com/2004/12/17/turnable_surfaces_prevent_wi_fi_leaks/) -- because I know everyone is trying to steal our secrets. \* [Car stereo with removable HD](http://estone-tech.com/) -- way easier to use than an ipod in the car \* And [a wifi access point in my car](http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,108697,00.asp) -- hmm, once i have full ip in the car, it sure seems like all these proprietary car nav systems with dated map discs will get crushed by mapquest/googlemaps/etc
