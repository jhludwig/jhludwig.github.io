Finally moving to [movabletype.org](http://www.movabletype.org/ "movabletype.org"). The loss of my Haloscan comments pushed me over the edge tho I had wanted to move for a while.

A real pain to get it working on Win2k/IIS. The default settings of URLSCAN are broken with MT. and the default security settings of IIS are not so great either. A lot of dorking around to get IIS and MT to coexist nicely -- as you can tell by my lack of posts for a week or so.

I'll be bringing old posts over slowly as I put some category tags and do other cleanup on them. And then I need to integrate my blogroll, playlist, and other features from my blogger blog.
