I hate it when I inconvenience someone by blowing a meeting. It just vanished from my calendar.

It probably doesn't help that my calendar is on my iPhone, synced through iTunes to iCal, where items are picked up by Entourage and synced with Exchange, from which Outlook syncs with them, or the Blackberry Enterprise Server picks them up and syncs them with my Blackberry (which I am trying to retire in favor of the iPhone). With all the syncing and transcoding going on, I'm surprised all my meetings aren't lost, or cloned 57 times (actually this does happen occasionally), shifted to an Asian timezone, and converted to [swatch internet time](http://www.swatch.com/internettime/). It is pretty much a miracle any of my schedule is right.
