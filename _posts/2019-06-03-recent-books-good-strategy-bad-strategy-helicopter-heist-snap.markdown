- [Good Strategy Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters-ebook/dp/B004J4WKEC) by Richard Rumelt. I hate pop business books but this book does not belong in that category. A timeless approach to the basics of strategy, whether in business or any other setting.
- [The Helicopter Heist](https://www.amazon.com/Helicopter-Heist-Novel-Based-Events/dp/1590519507) by Jonas Bonnier. Gripping, the last half of the book was a rollercoaster. Looking forward to rumored Netflix treatment.
- [The Plotters](https://www.amazon.com/Plotters-Novel-Kim-ebook/dp/B07CWDMQ45) by Un-su Kim. Thriller, a little surreal, even a bit of a parable. Interesting tho not something I would want to diet steadily on.
- [Snap](https://www.amazon.com/Snap-Belinda-Bauer-ebook/dp/B075VDP295) by Belinda Bauer. The cover claims this book is long listed for the Man Booker Prize, and that is normally the kiss of death for me, I find the winners to be unreadable. But this is a great thriller and a lot of fun.
