I just reviewed all my books I read over the last year. Here are the ones that stick with me.

Fiction:

- [All Systems Red](https://www.amazon.com/All-Systems-Red-Murderbot-Diaries/dp/0765397536) by Martha Wells. The first in a super fun science fiction series
- [Still life](https://www.amazon.com/Still-Life-Louise-Penny/dp/0312541538) by Louise Penny. The first in her series featuring Inspector Gamache, every entry I've read in the series is great.
- [Dear Committee Members](https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Committee-Members-Julie-Schumacher/dp/0345807332) by Julie Schumacher. Hilarious series of letters from a disgruntled professor

On the nonfiction side:

- [The Death and Life of the Great Lakes](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-Lakes/dp/0393355551) by Dan Egan. Won't be everyone's cup of tea but if you've spent time on the lakes, worth a read
- [The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World](https://www.amazon.com/Darkening-Age-Christian-Destruction-Classical/dp/0544800885) by Catherine Nixey. Probably will upset some readers.
- [Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/152473165X) by John Carreyrou. Wow, so much bad behavior by so many people.
- [Everything Trump Touches Dies: A Republican Strategist Gets Real About the Worst President Ever](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Trump-Touches-Dies-Republican/dp/1982103124) by Rick Wilson. Lots of competition for books shining a light on our current "President", this was my favorite.
- [Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety](https://www.amazon.com/Command-Control-Damascus-Accident-Illusion/dp/0143125788) by Eric Schlosser. Wow we have had so many near misses. And this is nuclear weapons -- how much slop and error is there in other governmental and corporate processes (say, drug testing) where the stakes are much lower?

Welcome any comments or reading ideas from others!
