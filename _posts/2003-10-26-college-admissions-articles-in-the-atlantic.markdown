[The Atlantic | November 2003 | The Atlantic College-Admissions Survey](http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2003/11/admissions.htm "The Atlantic | November 2003 | The Atlantic College-Admissions Survey") -- I just read in the print edition, pretty interesting. One of the main points is that the college admissions system is increasingly overloaded, particularly at the top end (of schools and students). As a result, the process is increasingly random as there is less and less ability to discriminate.
