[Effective Engineering](http://www.effecteng.com/ "untitled") and [Blue Point Engineering](http://www.bpesolutions.com/product.html) seem interesting, I need good vendors/sites that help me figure out exactly what pneumatics to buy for animatronic applications. [Frightmare](http://www.hauntcontroller.com/) has an interesting product too.
