[Suit Names 2 Judges Accused in a Kickback Case - NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/us/14judge.html?partner=rss&emc=rss). This case just stuns me. The plea agreement is way too lenient. And every kid who passed thru these judge's courts should be freed immediately and have any judgement stricken from their record.
