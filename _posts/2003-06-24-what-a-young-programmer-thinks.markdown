Just recovering from the flu, been off net for a while. Just saw this -- [Random Hacks: The Missing Future](http://www.randomhacks.net/stories/the-missing-future.html "Random Hacks: The Missing Future") -- what a great article about the opportunities in the software industry from the eyes of a younger person. This ought to terrify Microsoft -- there was a time when they had the hearts and minds of all young developers, but that time has clearly passed. It is just not cool to tell your friends "Hey I got my MSCE certificate", nor does it seem to present great economics to young people.
