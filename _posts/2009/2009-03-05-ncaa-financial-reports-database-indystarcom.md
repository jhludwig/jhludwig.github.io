[NCAA Financial Reports Database | IndyStar.com](http://www2.indystar.com/NCAA_financial_reports/revenue_stat/show_field_rank). Great site that lets you slice and dice revenues and expenses for all division 1 teams. OSU is #1 in football ticket sales revenue, #2 overall athletic revenues behind Texas. Texas kicks OSU's ass in football advertisements. LSU is #1 in concessions/parking. Fun stuff.
