\* [Scanaroo](http://www.scanaroo.com/). The idea of something to manage all my cards is cool -- one place to see account numbers, 1800 customer service numbers, etc etc etc. But this isn't it. The shortcoming is the dependency on the iphone camera. If it worked more like snaptell (use the photo to ID the card in a dbase and get all the detailed info and image from a dbase) it would be better. \* [Statplot](http://statplot.com/). Interesting idea, charts for sports junkies. Not a lot of community around my teams yet but will be fun to watch \* [Card.ly](http://www.readwriteweb.com/readwritestart/2009/07/cardly-lightweight-personal-mi.php). Microsites. If 140 chars is good enough for a message, why should a website need much more? I guess. Ultimately I don't know what I'd use this for. \* [TuneWiki](http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/07/tunewiki-is-amazing/). Rich loves it, I am not sure I get it yet. \* [Linear Programming using Google Spreadsheets](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/06/solving-linear-programming-problems.html). Is this really what is keeping people tied to Excel? \* [Notepad++ and plugins](http://lifehacker.com/5303634/autosave-adds-reassurance-to-notepad%252B%252B-editing). Not sure I will stick with, the app is busy \* [SuperUser](http://superuser.com/). This could turn out to be super helpful
