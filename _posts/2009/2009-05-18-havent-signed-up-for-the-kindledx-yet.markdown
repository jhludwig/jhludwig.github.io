[Official launch of the Kindle DX - Core77](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/official_launch_of_the_kindle_dx_13396.asp). I bought the Kindle and Kindle2 the instant I could. I am holding off on the DX.Â  Why?

\* It is not clear to me that it enhances recreational reading at all -- and in fact the size makes it less convenient

\* The cost savings on textbooks aren't large enough for me to get excited yet

\* And more importantly the usage model of a textbook is different than that of a recreational book. Lots of flipping to sections, flipping back and forth, index usage, marking places, etc -- does the device make this better?

\* Can I use it in an open book exam setting?

So I am not sure yet. Eventually the weight savings may compel me but I am not there yet.
