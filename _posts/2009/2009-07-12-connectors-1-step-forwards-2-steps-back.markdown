[Rich points out](http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/07/soon-no-more-random-apple-connectors/) that we may have some progress on using micro-usb as a universal device connector. That would be awesome. I carry the most disastrous bag of wallwarts and cables now to keep everything going.

On the other hand, a [new connector type for HDMI](http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer/hdmi_1_4/micro_connector.aspx) is coming. Sigh. The A/V connector/cable world remains a disaster.

Many good refs on the net for cable and connector types. Just discovered [Hardware Book](http://www.hardwarebook.info/) for instance.
