\* [Solar coasters](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20091223/solar-coasters/). Uber-dorky but I still think fun \* [Curvaceous bookshelves](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20091223/solar-coasters/). I suspect these might look a lot worse when filled. But still admirable. \* [Sled chair](http://design-milk.com/k2-chair/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+design-milk+%28Design+Milk%29&utm_content=Google+Reader). Blast back to the 60s. \* [Glass decanters](http://design-milk.com/joe-cariati/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+design-milk+%28Design+Milk%29&utm_content=Google+Reader). Sucker for all things glass. In another life I would have been a glass-blower. \* [Battery powered lamps](http://neoz.com.au/). Gorgeous.
