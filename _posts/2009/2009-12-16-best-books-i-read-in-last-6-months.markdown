Tim motivated me to look over all the books I've read in the last 6 months. Some great ones and some dreck. The ones I am glad I read:

- "The Road":amazon by Cormac McCarthy. Brutal, spartan. Viggo is the right man for the role.
- "The Chatham School Affair":amazon by Thomas H. Cook. A nice little tale of small town adultery and how it rips apart the lives around it. Edgar Award winner tho certainly not structured like a typical mystery. Hard to find.
- "The Power Of Myth":amazon by Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyers. Classic book about some of the deep issues of life and humanity.
- "QED":amazon by Richard P. Feynman. Simple (to the degree that anything quantum can be simple) explanation of the basics of quantum electrodynamics.
- "The Post-American World":amazon by Fareed Zakaria. A little dated by financial events but still good.
- "Consider Phlebas":amazon by Iain M. Banks. Seemingly a space opera but actually a thoughtful book about humanity, the futility of war. Must read the epilog.
- "The Tourist":amazon by Olen Steinhauer. Excellent tale of a CIA agent dealing with betrayal at many levels and his own secrets. Emotionally crushing ending.
- "Await Your Reply":amazon by Dan Choan. Strange tale of a serial ID thief trying to find a life for himself.
- "In Pale Battalions":amazon by Robert Goddard. A woman gradually discovers the truths about her family and background -- the cruelty and crimes during WWI which defined her life.
- "Julian Comstock: A Story of 22nd-Century America":amazon by Robert Charles Wilson. Excellent tale of post-apocolyptic America. Classic tragedy themes narrated in a folksy Twainish style.
- "The Only Three Questions That Count":amazon by Ken Fisher. One successful investor's view on how to invest. The discussion on national debt levels alone is worth the book.

Books I wish I hadn't bought: Air by Geoff Ryman, The Manual of Detection by Jedediah Barry, Third Degree by Greg Iles, T is for Trespass by Sue Grafton, The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil. All bad in their own way.
