[Dez Bryant ineligible for the year](http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/2009/10/28/curious-index-102809/) -- "...NCAA, who ended Dez Bryant's collegiate career for a stupid and relatively minor mistake in lying to NCAA officials about visits he had with Deion Sanders. If it requires work, they demur; if they can get a good hard swing in against a single individual, they will." Who are these people who destroy a young man's college career over a stupid dumb little mistake? Tell me, is any highly-paid adult anywhere going to have to pay a cost for this -- a coach, an NCAA administrator, a college administrator? No? Just this student is going to pay? That is not right.
