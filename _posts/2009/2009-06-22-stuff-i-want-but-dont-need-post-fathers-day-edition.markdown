Had a great father's day, got some cool photo tools, some books that look great, and a couple of games since I have played Left4Dead and Fallout3 to death. Here's some stuff I didn't get and probably for good reason.

Physical Stuff:

\* [Faux fountains](http://fountaincan.com/index.html) via [Scott Loftesness](http://www.sjl.us/main/2009/06/a-floating-faucet-fountain.html). Cool looking and an inspiration for Halloween. \* [IP PBX tips for home](http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/06/ip-pbx-for-dummies/). I was all excited about this several years ago but increasingly not so...having resident phone technology seems so backwards \* [Projects Watches wristwatches](http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2009/06/new_projects_wa.php). Cool looking but increasingly I have given up on wristwatches. \* [Television emulator.](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20090111/the-home-security-television-simulator/) I don't know, I think the dogs would prefer to watch real TV. \* [Olympus PEN](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/the_evolution_of_camera_forms_part_1_then_and_now_13795.asp). Having just hauled the Canon up and down a mountain Sunday morning, the idea of a smaller form factor camera with great lenses is appealing. \* [Super Duper Denon pre-amp](http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/03/denon-avp-aqhd/). Just can't face all the cabling problems tho of disconnecting my current and connecting in a new.

Virtual Stuff: \* [Mint.com](http://www.mint.com). Like the idea of automated analysis of my financials, but I am just not going to give another party access to all my financial credentials. They should license these tools to financial service firms for use on their own websites. \* [Cisco Network Magic](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2348279,00.asp?kc=PCRSS02129TX1K0000530). Nice review. Congrats to the former Pure Networks team. \* [Filemaker Bento iPhone app](http://db.tidbits.com/article/10259). I regularly get sucked into thinking I need a database and this app is sucking me in again. I know tho I will enter 7 records and abandon the damn thing so I am holding off.
