Installed the Win7 Beta1. I think MSFT will sell a ton of this. It just seems faster and cleaner than Vista. I haven't played with new features yet -- [early NYT review seems positive](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/technology/personaltech/22pogue.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=windows%207&st=cse) -- but glad that it seems crisp and uncluttered.
