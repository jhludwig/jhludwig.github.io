- [Black Heart Gold Pants](http://www.blackheartgoldpants.com/). These Iowa folks have potty mouths. I guess when you combine 4th grade literacy with a sense of impending doom, you get a lot of f-bombs.
- [Buckeye Battle Cry on the attack](http://www.thebuckeyebattlecry.com/?p=3365) against Black Heart Gold Pants.
- [CFN calls it for the Buckeyes](http://cfn.scout.com/2/918737.html) (tho not by a ridiculous 17 points).
- [The Weis Fact Sheet](http://www.ndnation.com/blog/2009/11/weis-fact-sheet.html). One thing Iowa and OSU fans can agree on, Weis is a tool.
- [Iowa City Press-Citizen](http://hawkcentral.press-citizen.com/). They'll still have wrestling.
