\* "Ahead of the Curve":amazon by Philip Delves Broughton. An insider's look at the Harvard Business School. The author tries to be balanced but the portrait is not flattering, a grotesquerie of ambition and ego and entitlement. \* "The Star Fraction":amazon by Ken MacLeod. Ultra-Balkanized Ã¼ber-libertarian future England in the throes of revolution. A lot of smart ideas but didn't think it really led anywhere.
