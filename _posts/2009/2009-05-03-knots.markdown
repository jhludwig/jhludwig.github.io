[Animated Knots by Grog](http://www.animatedknots.com/). -- animations of how to tie nearly every knot you ever need.Â  Oh and the forgotten [Zeppellin knot](http://www.motherearthnews.com/Modern-Homesteading/1980-01-01/The-Forgotten-Zeppelin-Knot.aspx) -- apparently critical in the production of Physical Graffiti.

Both via [Make](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/03/animated_knots.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890). The internet is freaking awesome.
