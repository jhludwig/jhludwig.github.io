Finally here. Here's your reading for the day:

\* Navy Football -- know your enemy. [Navy Sports](http://www.navysports.com/sports/m-footbl/navy-m-footbl-body.html), [The BirdDog](http://thebirddog.wordpress.com/). \* [OSU Depth chart out](http://blog.dispatch.com/buckeyesblog/2009/08/miller_amos_top_new_osu_depth.shtml) and other goodies in the weekly PDF. \* Because I can't help it, a little USC preview -- [how to attack Barkley](http://usc.freedomblogging.com/2009/08/31/usc-football-how-defenses-will-attack-matt-barkley/18879/).

Navy opens at a 21.5 point underdog. I don't think OSU beats the spread, Tressel will keep the plan conservative. OSU 28, Navy 14.
