[Oriented Assembly of Metamaterials -- Stebe et al. 325 5937: 159 -- Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/325/5937/159) -- good article.

> _"Such metamaterials may, for example, be used to create cloaking devices or light-based circuits based on manipulations of local optical electric fields rather than on the flow of electrons."_

> _"The challenge now is to move from hit-or-miss assemblies of academic interest to the creation of technologically relevant devices that combine particle and patterned assembly via large-scale processes."_

It is this latter challenge I find most interesting.
