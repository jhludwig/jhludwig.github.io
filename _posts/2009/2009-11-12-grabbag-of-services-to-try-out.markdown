- Master list of [google services](http://startpad.org/blog/139-google-products-and-services) -- nice list from mike. There ought to be a google game where I get points and achievements for trying services, getting to 100 docs stored, 100 contacts, etc.  I would totally be competitive.
- [Typekit](http://typekit.com/). Not really a type wonk but this looks worthy.
- [Oyster](http://www.oyster.com). Great hotel recos are hard to find.  This looks helpful
- [Clipperz](http://www.clipperz.com/). Yet another password management service
- [National Geographic top places](http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/2009/11/destinations-rated/list-text/1). Need to review, I have used the UN world heritage sites list as well.
- [SPeccy](http://lifehacker.com/5401456/speccy-gives-you-detailed-information-about-your-hardware). Detailed info about your hardware. Always helpful.
- [Springpad](http://webworkerdaily.com/2009/10/13/im-moving-from-backpack-to-springpad-heres-why/). One guy likes it better than BackPackIt.
