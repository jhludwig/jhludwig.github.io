Some silence in last month. Spent a lot of time enjoying family and central [Ohio](http://theludwigs.com/tag/ohio/), fall is the time to be in the state with football, color changes, often good weather, etc.

And when not in Ohio, I was in Helsinki (recommended: [Hotel Glo](http://www.palacekamp.fi/in_english/hotels/hotel_glo/), [Fazer Cafe](http://www.fazergroup.com/templates/Fazer_DivisionStartPage.aspx?id=32829&epslanguage=FI)), Stockholm ([Lydmar Hotel](http://www.lydmar.com/), [Vasa Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_Museum), Sture shopping area, [Skogskyrkog√•rden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skogskyrkog%C3%A5rden), Sodermalm, [Fasching Jazz Club](http://www.fasching.se/), Opera Bar, oh and much more), and Brussels ([Hotel Amigo](http://www.hotelamigo.com/), [St Michael/St Gudula Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Michael_and_St._Gudula_Cathedral), Roue d'Or, [Musee Magritte](http://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/Portail/Site/Typo3.asp?lang=FR&id=languagedetect), Comic Museum, Sablon, [Wittamer chocolates](http://www.wittamer.com/fr/index.php), and much more).

Mentally I've been thinking about [Fat Spaniel](http://www.fatspaniel.com/fat-spaniel-blog/us-department-of-energy%E2%80%99s-solar-decathlon-2009/), a couple new things, and my half time load at UW this term as I continue my education. Lots of differential equations theory and numerical analysis, stuff I touched on 25 years ago, but good to get the base refreshed. Amazing how the tools have changed -- MatLab and Mathematica are just incredible pieces of software.
