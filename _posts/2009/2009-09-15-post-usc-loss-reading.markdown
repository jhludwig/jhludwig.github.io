\* "Brutal takedown of Tressel over at Dr. Saturday":http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/blog/dr\_saturday/post/Deconstructing-The-grisly-demise-of-Tressel-Ba?urn=ncaaf,189322. _Particularly on offense, Ohio State's gameplan against the Trojans was utter rubbish, and it failed to meet the number one requirement of every gameplan: put your players in position to succeed_ \* Pete says "Locker is better than Pryor":http://www.insidesocal.com/usc/archives/2009/09/better-than-pry.html. Of course he will say that this week but it is up to Pryor to make that statement seem ridiculous. \* "An OSU follower's view":http://www.elevenwarriors.com/2009/09/five-things-usc.html. Coaching breakdown, Pryor breakdown. And what irks me is the failure of the coaching staff to react to Pryor's shortcomings in their gameplan. \* "A general roundup of coverage":http://www.elevenwarriors.com/2009/09/further-reading-usc.html \* We "discover an entirely new brand of disappointment":http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/blog/dr\_saturday/post/Ohio-State-discovers-an-entirely-new-brand-of-di?urn=ncaaf,189030.

It was a great great game and I enjoyed the evening thoroughly up til the last minute. And man our team played hard and the fans gave it their all, so proud to be a part of the community. But I sure hope Tressel is learning from this and getting better, as he often talks about his teams needing to do.
