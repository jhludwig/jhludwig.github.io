\* [Fold out shelving system](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/mark_kinsleys_killer_foldout_shelving_wall_14463.asp). Wow this is just awesome looking. \* [Kurt's key list of propbuilding tools](http://www.grimvisions.com/tools/things-i-use-in-my-shop). \* [Rich and Bob's Tripod reco](http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2009/08/lightweight-tripod/) -- Gitzo1541T and the Really Right Stuff BH-40LR. I actually need this. \* [Hangman light](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20090828/hangman-light-tired/). Awesome tho I think the rest of the family might object.
