\* [WPTouch plugin](http://www.bravenewcode.com/wptouch/) for wordpress is awesome. check out theludwigs.com from your iphone. \* Messing around with [Slingbox](http://www.slingmedia.com) finally. Works well tho I had to massively reconfig home network to get rid of routers -- configuring to get through one router was reasonable; getting through two was nearly impossible; getting through the three I had in place would have required several PhDs. \* [Download Manager Tweak](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/256). Probably prefer download statusbar \* [Vacuum your firefox db](http://lifehacker.com/5344418/make-firefox-faster-by-vacuuming-your-database). No idea if this actually did anything. Didn't seem to make Firefox explode so I guess that is a plus. \* [Polymath](http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/07/31/polymath-equals-user-innovatio/). Lots of great links to math formatting services for the web. \* [Gliffy plugin for wordpress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gliffy-plugin-for-wordpress/). Seems like it could be useful as well.
