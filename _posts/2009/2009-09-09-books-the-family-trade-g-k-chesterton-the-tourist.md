One total winner in this group, and the others are reasonable as well.

\* "The Family Trade":amazon by Charles Stross. A fine alternate worlds tale from Stross, nice to see the obvious use of world tripping explored -- crime. Amazon gives 3.5 stars, and the series doesn't seem to improve from there, but I found it engaging. Even so-so Stross is better than 9/10s of the dreck in the science fiction section \* "Classic British Literature: Works of G.K. Chesterton":amazon by G.K. Chesterton. The Father Brown stories are very engaging mysteries with a nice central character. Yes this is all very dated material but enjoyable. \* "The Tourist":amazon by Olen Steinhauer. Excellent tale of a CIA agent dealing with betrayal at many levels and his own secrets. Much more intriguing than your typical espionage tale, tho not so obscure as LeCarre. Emotionally crushing ending. Amazon says 4 stars, I might go 4.5
