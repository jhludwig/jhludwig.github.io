No theme here other than "stuff I happened across recently"

- [Terry Tao math blog](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/). Brain stretching.
- [How Goldman profited on housing crash](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/77791.html). Don't know how reliable this source is but disturbing.
- [Controversy about whether there is or is not a giant magma chamber](http://scienceblogs.com/eruptions/2009/10/the_return_of_the_dreaded_gian.php) under the state of Washington.Â  Probably not but a great disaster movie in the making.
- Thread on [design versus iteration](http://kerneltrap.org/node/11).
- [Automated sports writing](http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/the-robots-are-coming-oh-theyre-here/). Amazingly readable. (Thanks [Phil](http://thebogles.com/blog/)).
- [The Billion Dollar Gram](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-billion-dollar-gram/). Another one via Phil.
- [Gravitational Corridors.](http://slashdot.org/story/09/09/17/1519201/Gravitational-Currents-Could-Slash-Fuel-Needed-For-Space-Flight) Cool.
- [Nowhere are we more honest than the search box](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/11/the-best-sentence-i-read-today-746-am-edition.html).
- [NASA dollars pissed away on 2012 nutballs](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/11/nasa-faq-2012.html)
- [Why it is harder than ever to get into some colleges.](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/11/why-its-harder-than-before-to-get-into-your-favorite-college.html) Interesting question about whether this applies to other markets.
