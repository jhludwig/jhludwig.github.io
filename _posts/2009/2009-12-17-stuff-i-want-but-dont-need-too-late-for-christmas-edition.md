- Awesome [Studio Mango](http://design-milk.com/persian-carpet-by-studio-mango/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+design-milk+%28Design+Milk%29&utm_content=Google+Reader) rugs. Love the asymmetry.
- [Hometown Jigsaw Puzzle](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/004104.php). Would order one but 2-3 weeks for production...
- [Compartes Chocolates](http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2009/12/compartes_choco.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ch+%28Cool+Hunting%29&utm_content=Google+Reader). Not really a chocolate fan but these are just so great looking...
- [Blue shift bumper sticker.](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/12/my_new_favorite_bumper_sticker.html) Geek humour.
- [Tyler Cowen's book list](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/11/best-of-the-year-with-an-eye-toward-christmas-gifts.html). His recos have a high hit rate.
- [Pocket Ref book](http://www.grimvisions.com/products/reference-books-in-the-shop). If Kurt recos, it will be good.
- [3d power plug](http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/rozetkus-3d/). Doesn't exist but if it did...
- [Cole-Bar Hammer](http://toolmonger.com/2009/11/09/cole-bar-hammer/). OK I only drive about 30 nails a year but still this looks like a winner.
- [LED Bed](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2009/11/expose_led_bed.html). Looks like effective birth control to me.
- [Motif cube.](http://design-milk.com/brooklyn5and10-com-giveaway-motif-cube/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+design-milk+%28Design+Milk%29&utm_content=Google+Reader) Looks puzzle-ish but isn't.
- [Power Plug with USB.](http://store.fastmac.com/product_info.php?products_id=458) Way underpriced.
