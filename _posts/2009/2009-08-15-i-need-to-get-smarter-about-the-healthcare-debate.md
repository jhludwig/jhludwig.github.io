Having spent way too much time with healthcare providers, insurance companies, etc, in the last 4 years, I certainly support change. Almost any change, change for change's sake, is worth trying, because the system is not very satisfying right now. We should clearly try to do something. So I am inclined towards supporting the new proposals in Congress. I need to get smarter about the details.

In general, shifting power away from the monied interests -- insurance companies, pharma companies, large healthcare organizations -- and towards the individuals -- patients and doctors -- is the right thing to do. Do the proposals achieve this? I don't know. Certainly [some insurance companies are pissed off](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2009665821_obama15.html) which is probably a good sign, tho [other pharma and insurance companies are funding support ads](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/health/policy/16ads.html?ref=us) which is concerning -- if they are so excited about the proposals, it probably means money in their pockets, and that money is coming from someone.

I kind of hate the fact that all these large organizations -- pharma, insurance cos, the various NGOs -- are even participating in the discussion. My view is that only voters/citizens should participate, it should be illegal for all these other entities to fund ads and lobbying efforts.
