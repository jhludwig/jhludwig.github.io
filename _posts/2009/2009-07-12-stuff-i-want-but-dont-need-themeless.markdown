\* [Solar Camping Lantern](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20090705/solar-power-led-vintage-camping-lantern/) -- I remember the old coleman lanterns using white gas, the pumping, the mantles. What a pain in the a$%. This looks way simpler. \* [King Cobra wristwatch](http://watchismo.blogspot.com/2009/07/urwerk-king-cobra-cc1-reintrepretation.html) -- awesome looking. Tho I have completely given up on wristwatches. \* [Carabiners make everything better](http://toolmonger.com/2009/07/03/carabiners-make-everything-better/). So true. \* [Denture ice cubes](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/07/denture_ice_cubes.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890). Seriously awesome. \* [Resistor cheat sticker](http://tinkerlog.com/2009/07/05/resistor-cheat-sticker/). I can never remember how to speak resistor. \* [Antitheft lunch bags](http://design-milk.com/anti-theft-lunch-bags/) -- brilliant. \* [Woven wood chairs](http://design-milk.com/weaving-wood/). Beautiful. Probably uncomfortable as hell.
