Hurray, got the mail from the ticket office today, we'll be there. Not like it was hard to get them -- apparently the alums didn't snap up all the tix as there will be a [public sale](http://blog.dispatch.com/buckeyesblog/2009/12/public_sale_for_rose_bowl_tick.shtml).

As Rose Bowl prep, some reading:

- A [nice primer on Rose Bowl and bowl system history](http://www.thebuckeyebattlecry.com/?p=3936). There is no NCAA football championship, the bowls are not about a championship. Important to remember as we get into the silly season now with everyone gnashing and wailing about the BCS.
- [Bowl gifts](http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/64318). Pretty standardized across all the games at this point.
- OSU 7-0 all time against Oregon, yay!
- But the [Oregon trolls are out in force in the comments here](http://blog.blockonation.com/2009/12/2010-rose-bowlohio-state-vs-oregon.html)
- The Rose Bowl is [pretty rarefied air for Oregon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ducks_bowl_game_history) -- their usual destinations are El Paso, San Diego, Las Vegas, etc.Â  Welcome to the big time.
