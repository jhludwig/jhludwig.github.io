\* [Urth Cafe](http://www.urthcaffe.com/) -- sandwiches, salads, coffee, tea, breakfast too, and open at dinner time. Nice baked goods too \* [Bravo Pizza](http://www.bravosantamonica.com/bravo/) \* [Cha Cha Chicken](http://www.chachachicken.com/) -- WAY better than the website. A favorite \* [Lula Mexicana](http://www.gerrigilliland.com/lula/) -- good authentic mexican. I am always a sucker for tamales \* [Shoop's Deli](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shoops-delicatessen-santa-monica). Solid sandwich and salad fare, closed at dinner \* [Bergamot Station](http://www.bergamotstation.com/) -- good collection of galleries, easy to walk around \* [The Bridge Cinema](http://www.thebridgecinema.com/home/home.asp?l=8275). Ok not in Santa Monica at all, in Culver City, nice high end theatre. Reserved seating which is cool.
