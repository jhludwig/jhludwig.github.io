Remember the [Leg Lamp](http://www.redriderleglamps.com/) from A Christmas Story?

\* [USB Aroma Diffuser/Hub/Moodlight](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20090817/usb-aroma-diffuser-usb-hub/) -- good to see that the tech industry inventive spirit remains alive, with products like this the US economy will remain a juggernaut for years to come. \* [Paperclip Lamp](http://design-milk.com/paperclip-lamp/). I bet it breaks if you adjust it too many times. \* [GSelect](http://shop.gessato.com/). A whole site of overdesigned stuff that I should probably avoid. \* [Infinite Attic](http://toolmonger.com/2009/08/17/infinite-attic/). To store all the crap I shouldn't have bought. Sadly I could really use this...
