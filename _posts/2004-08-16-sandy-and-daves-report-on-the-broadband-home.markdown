I've mentioned this before, but again I really like the [Broadband Home Report](http://www.broadbandhomecentral.com/report/ "Broadband Home Report"). Good review of industry activities around the broadband home. Interesting notes this month on home health monitoring; voip spam; China's [IGRS](http://www.mobiletechnews.com/info/2003/07/17/164955.html) as a competitor to [DLNA](www.dlna.org); [Verizon's FTTP product](http://www22.verizon.com/ForyourHome/Fios/fioshome.asp). Always a good read.
