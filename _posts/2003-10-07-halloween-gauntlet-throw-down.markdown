My neighbor, let's call him Norton, has had the audacity to put his props out in his yard. This is an affront on several levels. One, I am the recognized King of Halloween in my neighborhood, and no one puts out props before me. Two, he didn't inform me of his plans. Three, he had the temerity to build and deploy a coffin, which he must have known I was doing. Four, he set out his props on a Monday night -- this is a clear breach of protocol, props go out on the weekend at or around the 15th.  
  
Vengeance will be mine.
