![](http://thm-a02.yimg.com/nimage/c5dfed28b588c922 "OSU")Nice to see the Buckeyes wrap up the Big10 title in dominating fashion, onto the dance! And especially nice to wipe out Minnesota, too bad they weren't knocked out of the tourney altogether. Why the hatred for the hapless Gophers? It all goes back to [this incident](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085766/index.htm), which pretty much flattened the OSU program for the next 10 years and ended Witte's career. The Minnesota thugs got wrist slaps, Winfield went on to a successful baseball career which always galled me.

Here's hoping the Gophers flame out in their first game.
