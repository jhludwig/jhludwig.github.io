[![atom](images/atom-300x157.png)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/atom.png)Finally downloaded [Atom](http://atom.io). I am getting a little frustrated with the plugin community around Sublime Text as it seems that people may be moving away from Sublime, and who can blame them given the uncertain path for Sublime. Atom seems nice, maybe a little slower than Sublime Text, but still good. Most of the plugins I want seem to be there.
