I've never gotten around to [redoing my home phone system to be all-IP](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001751.html) but still have a deep interest. Here's a couple more things to consider when the project bubbles to the top:

\* [Asteriskathome](http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/) -- a version of the open source pbx for the home. A nice web management UI and hopefully config'ed for the most common home features. \* [Fonality](http://www.fonality.com/). I met these guys last week, great guys. Complete PBX features at a price small businesses can afford. \* A [list of open source pbx software](http://www.postneo.com/2005/02/07/open-source-pbxes) if i want to go further afield. \* Or I could just use [this](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/01/using_skype_on_.html) to bridge all my analog handsets over to Skype.
