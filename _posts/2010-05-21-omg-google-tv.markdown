OK I am sure I will buy [one of these](http://www.google.com/tv/) when I can because, well, I am a classic early adopter and will get sucked in. But as mentioned at [All Things D](http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20100521/why-will-google-tv-be-any-different-from-webtv-or-aol-tv-or-msntv-or/), why will GoogleTV be any different than any of the other failed tv/internet merged products?

I can already watch tons of movies today or lots of crappy web content on my Comcast box, my Tivo box, my AppleTV box. But none of these let me break free of the Comcast/media chokehold and let me watch the really critical content -- HD sports (particularly college football), HD first-run top-100 popular drama/comedy series from ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX/UPN/TNT/etc. Google announcements with Logitech and Sony are meaningless -- "Logitech will make pretty much anything":http://www.logitech.com/en-us/431/963?WT.z\_sp=Image and "Sony hasn't been relevant since about 1979":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman. Now if this box came with an announcement of content availability from ESPN and from 4-5 major networks then it might be exciting. But I can't see why these networks and Comcast would let that happen without being forced.

But I am sure I will buy one anyway...
