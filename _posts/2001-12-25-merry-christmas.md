**Merry Christmas!**

Hope everyone is having a great day. We are all well and enjoying the day together.

This past weekend we went to see, among other things, a performance by [The Bobs](http://www.bobs.com/). What an amazing group. They did some great a capella holiday music, and the most astounding a capella version of Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze". I know this sounds bizarre, it was but it was great. Worth a night out if they ever come your way.

We also saw two movies this weekend -- [Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring](http://www.lordoftherings.net/), and [A Beautiful Mind](http://www.abeautifulmind.com/). Both great flicks.

If I had to choose between them and a night with The Bobs, The Bobs would win every time.

L begs to differ. She thought The Bobs were scary.
