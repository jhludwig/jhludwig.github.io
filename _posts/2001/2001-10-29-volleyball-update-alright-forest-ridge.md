**Volleyball Update**

Alright! Forest Ridge won the playoff game friday night to determine the sole champion of the Emerald City league. It was a hard fought match -- [U Prep](http://www.universityprep.org/) won the first game 15-13. Forest Ridge the second 15-13. In the third, Forest Ridge went up 14-3, but U-Prep wouldn't quit and fought back to 14-12 before Forest Ridge closed them out. A thrilling match.

As a result, Forest Ridge gets a bye through the Emerald City Tournament and the first round of district tournaments. Their next match is this coming Saturday at the district tournaments in Edmunds.
