**Books**

The Economist's [book picks for the year](http://www.economist.com/books/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=916756). A pretty interesting list. I've ordered 4 or 5.

As indicated in my book links, I am reading a great book on construction failure right now. Deep in my heart I've always wanted to be an architect and I guess I am going to slowly read my way through the field. The best thing I have learned in this book so far -- poorly constructed concrete and masonry structures can be deadly out here in earthquake country. Now I understand why Seattle buildings have so little ornamental stonework on them -- it falls off in quakes and kills people.
