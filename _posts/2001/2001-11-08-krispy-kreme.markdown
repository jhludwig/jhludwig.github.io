**Krispy Kreme**

OK folks it is just a doughnut. Why this town has gone [nuts](http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis/web/vortex/display?slug=krispy31&date=20011031&query=krispy+kreme) over them I do not understand.

I guess we don't have the [Mariners](http://www.mariners.org/) to talk about any more. No one cares enough about the [Seahawks](http://www.seahawks.com/) to talk about them. The crummy local weather is old news. And the national news scene is just not very uplifting.

So we obsess about doughnuts. Topic number one every morning is [Krispy Kreme](http://www.krispykreme.com/) gossip -- how long is the line, have you had one yet, did you hear about the 5 additional outlets they are going to open in the Seattle area.

If we could only get a [White Castle](http://www.whitecastle.com/home.asp) now...
