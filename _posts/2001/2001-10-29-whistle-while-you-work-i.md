**Whistle While You Work**

I wish I had the time of an 11 year old.

John spent nearly every waking moment this past weekend learning how to [whistle](http://www.learn2.com/08/0876/0876.asp). He made pretty good progress -- Friday night all he could produce was a breathy puffing sound. By Sunday he was able to make a reasonable whistle, tho he can't vary the tone much yet. I guess that is next weekend's goal.

We of course are all going insane.
