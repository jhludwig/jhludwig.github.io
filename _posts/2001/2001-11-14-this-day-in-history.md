**This Day In History**

First of all, when it comes to doughnuts, we're [#1!](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134366136_bizbriefs14.html)

I hope the [weather](http://www.king5.com/topstories/10014371_WX1114windandrainstorm.html) doesn't prevent us from consuming even more doughnuts.

More importantly, let's wish the microprocessor a happy [birthday](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-7865172-0.html?tag=tp_pr). In one form or another it has had a huge impact on our lives. Certainly on my life anyway.

I still remember the first [Bowmar Brain](http://www.electronicjungle.com/bow_mx25.html) that Dad brought home. Wow. I was entranced. I soon graduated to the [TI-59](http://www.ti59.com/), which introduced me to primitive programming. Then I managed to buy a [TI 99/4](http://www.99er.net/994.html) and had my first personal computing experience. This machine was a dog but the notion of personal computing was infectious for me.

I quickly ditched the TI (which again was a dog) and got an Apple \]\[[](http://apple2history.org/) which was a great machine. I loved buying software in ziplock bags at the [Microcenter](http://www.microcenter.com/) on Lane Avenue. I loved the huge market of addon cards. I loved the nascent computer industry press -- Byte magazine and Creative Computing were my monthly bibles.

Then I read an article about the [Smalltalk](http://www.smalltalk.org/main.html) programming environment in [Byte](http://www.byte.com/) magazine and was hooked on the idea of a graphical interface, and bought a [Mac](http://www.apple.com/) at the first possible moment -- my second year in grad school, C and I had absolutely no money, but I managed to buy a Mac the first day it was on the market.

Then I moved out west here and had to adopt [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.asp) and PCs wholeheartedly. By now I am probably on my 20th Windows PC in the workplace and probably 10th at home -- my latest being a hardcore game machine from [Alienware](http://www.alienware.com/index_yesflash.asp).

And of course I now use microprocessors in about 100 other machines in my daily life -- in my stereo, in my car, in my MP3 player, in my [cell phone](http://www.mot.com/LMPS/iDEN/products/i85s/i85s.html), in my [Blackberry](http://www.blackberry.net/), etc...

It has been fun so far...
