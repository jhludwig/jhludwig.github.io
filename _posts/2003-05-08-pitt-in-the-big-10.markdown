Derek thinks the Big10 should invite Pitt to join if the Big East collapsese -- [BallBlog: Conference Shuffling](http://www.ballblog.com/archives/000349.html#000349 "BallBlog: Conference Shuffling"). Gosh I would hold out for Notre Dame still. I was never that impressed with Pitt as an institution when I lived in Pittsburgh, I just don't know that they bring much allure to the Big 10.
