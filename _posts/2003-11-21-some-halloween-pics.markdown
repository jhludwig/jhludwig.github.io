OK I am a pretty lame photographer, and so here are [some lame halloween pics](http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/Halloween2003/halloween2003.htm) from my setup this year. Apologize for their lack of comprehensiveness, lack of compositional quality, lack of any kind of style whatsoever. And apologize that I created this page in Word2003 so it is full of all kinds of html cruft. Next year I'll get the [Sony camera mentioned below](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001154.html) so I can get some night shots...
