Our new copier in the office has this killer scanner. Great sheet feeder, and willl email yoru scanned docs as a pdf to you.

Given that I have scads of storage available now, it has made me realize it is now time to start scanning and saving all important documents. I always have trouble finding various personal legal documents. Well no more.

A question I have tho is how to manage all this content. I am going to end up with a lot of imaged documents. I wonder if all the free photo management apps like Picasa can handle pdfs? i'd love to have all the photo management features -- tagging, timeline view, etc.
