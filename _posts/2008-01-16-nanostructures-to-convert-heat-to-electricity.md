[Nanowires convert heat to electricity - nanotechweb.org](http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/tech/32451 "Nanowires convert heat to electricity - nanotechweb.org") -- this seems very interesting. the huge amount of electricity we waste as heat is an appealing target. I wonder what savings could be made in general by replacing bulk machined wires and components with nanoengineered parts -- as this article suggests, it seems like a lot could be done to improve conductivity and reduce resistivity.
