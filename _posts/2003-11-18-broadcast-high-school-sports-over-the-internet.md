I'm looking for ways to broadcast high school sporting events over the internet -- [iHigh.com -- The High School Internet Network](http://www.ihigh.com/0,1773,1_11_0,00.html "iHigh.com -- The High School Internet Network") seems to have a hosted solution with reasonable academic pricing. We could also cobble together a solution from Shoutcast but we don't have a server location, we'd have to go to a hosted Shoutcast service like [VBDigital](http://www.vbdigital.com/?action=sch). I haven't seen a lot of examples of schools doing broadcasts except at the ihigh site, still looking for best practices and ideas.
