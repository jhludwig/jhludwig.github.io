I've plowed thru much of the Hugo nominees in the last couple weeks, thanks to the [great deal to get them all in ebook form](http://theludwigs.com/2011/05/hugo-awards-nominees-in-ebook-form/).

\* Novels: "Cryoburn":amazon by Lois M. Bujold. At first I thought, well, this story has been written before. But ended up feeling like very compelling. "Blackout":amazon by Connie Willis. Eh. Gave up. Vaguely ridiculous plotting. "Feed":amazon by Mira Grant. Read this earlier in the year, it is a great tide. My vote. Still two more to read tho.

\* Novellas: _The Lifecycle of Software Objects_ by Ted Chiang. Interesting speculation on the maturation of artificially intelligent programs, a little mechanistic but interesting. _The Lady Who Plucked Red Flowers Beneath the Queen's Window_ by Rachel Swirsky. A nearly immortal sorceress thru the ages, good but not great. _The Maiden Flight of McCauley's Bellerophon_ by Elizabeth Hand. Fanciful, touching, not really my taste. _Troika_ by Alistair Reynolds. Russians exploring a uniquely russian alien spacecraft, yawn. _The Sultan of the Clouds_ by Geoffrey A. Landis. Very nice tale of a far future Venus, where the atmosphere is settled by humans. I like the Landis tale.

\* Novelette: _Eight Miles_ by Sean McMullen. Steampunk, an exiled martian and balloonist partner up. _The Emperor of Mars_ by Allen M. Steele. A touching story of a Mars colonist dealing with incredible grief. _The jaguar House in Shadow_ by Aliette de Bodard. Intrigue in a modern day Aztec empire. Nice atmosphere, would love to read more. _That Leviathan, Whom Thou Hast Made_ by Eric James Stone. A Mormon missionary in the sun, reaching out to plasma beings -- original. _Plus or minus_ by James Patrick Kelly. Disaster strikes a cargo hauler on way from asteroids, some quality characters. Both the de Bodard and Stone stories are memorable.

\* Short Stories: _Amaryllis_ by Carrie Vaughn. Life on a resource-constrained world. Lots of characterization in a short story, could certainly support a longer tale. _Ponies_ by Kij Johnson. Wow, super nasty dark story about kids and cliques. _The Things_ by Peter Watts. The thing, told from its perspective -- Nicely done. I really like the Watts story
