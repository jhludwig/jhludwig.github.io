**TiVo posting to blog**. I am very jealous of [Matt's work](http://www.hitormiss.org/tivo/) to post his TiVo use to his blog. I am very scared to hack into my TiVo tho because it is the most "mission critical" box in the house -- the family will flip out if it quits working. I really want a way to suck the data out without having to crack the case.
