\* [Perfect lens could reverse Casimir force (July 2007) - News - nanotechweb.org](http://nanotechweb.org/articles/news/6/7/25/1?rss=2.0 "Perfect lens could reverse Casimir force (July 2007) - News - nanotechweb.org") -- a way to eliminate sticking forces at the nano/mems level. pretty fascinating. \* [Motor proteins](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5836/333) (AAAS membership required) -- _"The biological cell is equipped with a variety of molecular machines that perform complex mechanical tasks such as cell division or intracellular transport. One can envision employing these biological motors in artificial environments. We review the progress that has been made in using motor proteins for powering or manipulating nanoscale components. In particular, kinesin and myosin biomotors that move along linear biofilaments have been widely explored as active components. Currently realized applications are merely proof-of-principle demonstrations. Yet, the sheer availability of an entire ready-to-use toolbox of nanosized biological motors is a great opportunity that calls for exploration."_
