- [Citizen Outlaw](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43616082-citizen-outlaw) by Charles Barber. An OK telling of the story of the redemption of a man, but I don't really feel like it added much to the conversation. I would have enjoyed more analysis and criticism of the structures that worked for and against him.
- [The Old Success](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42360879-the-old-success) by Martha Grimes. Having not read the previous 24 books featuring this detective, I found it hard to jump into the story. A nice setting and nice writing, but assumes I know too much.
- [The Next Great Migration](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51079278-the-next-great-migration) by Sonia Shah. This was interesting and makes the case that migrations and movements of humans/animals/plants is much more pervasive and widespread than we have traditionally thought. But there really wasn't much about the "next great migration", I kind of wonder if the author had this title forced on her.
- [The Art of Travel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23422.The_Art_of_Travel) by Alain de Botton. A fascinating discussion of travel, of art, of perception. The book ultimately is not really about travel, but is about perceiving deeply what is all around you. Worth the time.
