I'm sure I'll get one of both, but I have to agree -- [I have to have HD downloads or I won't bother with the video service](http://wmf.editthispage.com/).  And I don't have a [subway ride to allow me to watch videos](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=1514) (though I admire the use of \[removed site\] to fill up the ipod).

Can I just download the FrontRow software for my mac mini?  Doesn't seem like I can.  Bummer.
