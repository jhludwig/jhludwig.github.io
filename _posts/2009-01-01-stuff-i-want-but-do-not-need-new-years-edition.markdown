\* [Hardcore Computer](http://www.hardcorecomputer.com/) -- fully submerged computer. So you can reboot more quickly and reliably. \* [HighSpeedPC](http://www.highspeedpc.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=TopTechLRG) -- on second thought, screw the case, who needs it. \* [Innovative snow shovels](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/is_there_a_better_way_to_shovel_snow_12230.asp) -- might need again in another 20 years. \* [Magnetic iPhone camera lenses](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/magnetic_iphone_camera_lenses_12229.asp) -- cool idea. For the 3 pictures a month I take with my iphone. \* [Lighted Garden Nozzle](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20081226/the-lighted-garden-nozzle-for-late-night-gardeners/) -- I have no idea why but it is cool. \* [Map Quilts](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/12/map_quilts.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890) -- awesome, love maps.
