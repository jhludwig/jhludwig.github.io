In the northwest:

\* On Vancouver Island, the [Aerie](http://www.aerie.bc.ca/) or the [Wickaninnish Inn](http://www.wickinn.com/). Ok probably cold and grey right now too but would be great in the summer. \* [The Stephanie Inn](http://www.stephanie-inn.com/welcome.asp) has always been a winner for us. And we love Cannon Beach. \* Further south is the [Tu Tu' Tun](http://www.tututun.com/flashmain.html), we've heard good things about.

Further afield:

\* We love Kona Village but we may want to try the other islands. [Turtle Bay Hotel](http://www.turtlebayhotel.com/homepage.cfm) looks like a good place to try on Oahu. \* The nice folks at [Exclusive Resorts](http://www.exclusiveresorts.com) have recommended [Miraval](http://www.miravalresort.com/), and we're game to try that...
