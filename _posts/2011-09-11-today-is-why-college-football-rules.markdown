OSU's win in doubt until the last play. 3 game winning TDs in the last 90 seconds of the Michigan-ND game. Iowa-Iowa State overtime. USC preserves win on the last play of the game...and are credited with 6 more points hours later. And a half dozen other close games.

ND and Georgia's seasons are on the rocks. Michigan is resurgent. Wisconsin looks like a title favorite. The highs and lows in the sport are so intense.

There are so many things wrong with the structure of the sport...but my gosh, Saturdays are awesome.
