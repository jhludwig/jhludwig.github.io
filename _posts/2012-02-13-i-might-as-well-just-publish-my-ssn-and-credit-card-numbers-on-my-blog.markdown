"Taking your computer or phone into china":http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/11/technology/electronic-security-a-worry-in-an-age-of-digital-espionage.html?pagewanted=all is a bad idea, and I assume you are at risk in other countries as well. And why do we think we are safe here, when "someone can just litter around these sniffers":http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/27/2753176/f-bomb-diy-darpa-funded-spy-computer, and "squadrons of these things may be flying around":http://www.realdanlyons.com/blog/2012/02/01/these-mini-copters-flying-in-formation-are-the-coolest-thing-ive-seen-all-day/, and not that far in the future -- the "FAA is letting these things in domestic airspace this year":http://www.allgov.com/Controversies/ViewNews/Arrival\_of\_Domestic\_Drones\_Challenges\_Air\_Safety\_120207.

Probably time to radically rethink my approach to data security.

UPDATE: and of course today I got a call from my bank and my credit card has been compromised. Somebody trying to sneak in $1 charges repeatedly. I don't need to even put my card numbers up here, I should just assume that they are compromised from the get-go. In some sense it makes life easier -- I don't worry about giving my credit card numbers out to anyone because I assume they are already in circulation. What is important is watching my account statements carefully.
