Our house was flu-ridden this week and I am just catching up on all the discussion about MT 3.0 licensing -- good stuff by [Tim](http://www.timaoutloud.org/archives/000351.html), [Mena and the changes](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/05/movable_type_30.shtml), [Mark Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0), [Simon Phipps](http://www.webmink.net/2004/05/trackbacks-as-zeitgeist.htm), [Rich](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_blogs/001529.html). 

Personally I have no problem paying for software that I use frequently and will happily pay something for my blog management tool.  The newly modified license looks reasonable.  I'll look around at other solutions as [Rich](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_blogs/001536.html) is doing though I will be cautious in jumping -- MT 2.661 is not busted for me, I am not driven to move right away, I'll let others experiment and I will learn from that.  I have to admire SixApart for modifying their proposal quickly in the face of overwhelming criticism.
