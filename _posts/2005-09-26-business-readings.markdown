\* [Subvert from within](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/09/subvert_from_wi.html) -- great tips on how to remain focused on the customer, even within a large org. Totally relevant to team members in orgs of all sizes. (from [geekman.com](http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Miscellaneous.html)) \* [Google's use of prediction markets internally](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/09/google_is_using.html). I wonder how many participants you need to make this work well. \* [NetworthIQ](http://www.networthiq.com/). If this was done in depth, allowing users to compare investment strategies and particular investments, that'd be pretty powerful. \* [A VC's view of web2.0 investing](http://www.aventureforth.com/2005/09/15/a-vcs-perspective-on-web-20/). Good points. Like the observation that these services can be built and trialed very inexpensively. That seems like the right first step to me -- no point in investing huge gobs of time and dollars if no one cares about an initial quick implementation. \* Same guy [on games investing](http://www.aventureforth.com/2005/09/08/video-games-the-tyranny-of-13-year-olds-and-a-7b-market/) -- _"Despite the incredible market size numbers, gaming, as a category, hasn’t produced many significant wins for venture investors. I think this will change as the underlying technology continues to improve and as people–not just kids–spend an increasing amount of time and dollars playing games."_
