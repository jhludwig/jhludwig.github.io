[Formula Drift - Professional Drifting Championship](http://formulad.com/index.php "Formula Drift - Professional Drifting Championship") -- great event. The sport is in its infancy here so you can easily get into the pits, up close to the track, meet the drivers, etc. The races are exciting although a little repetitive. They need to think about how to get more cars on the track at once, and to add some uncertainty to the event.

Oh yeah, attending Formula D does not contribute to good driving behaviour. The parking lot was a showcase of amateur drifting and the highway home was a sequence of race vignettes featuring a variety of souped-up [ricers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_burner), including some really nice [imports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Skyline). I've been known to drive fast at times but I was background noise.
