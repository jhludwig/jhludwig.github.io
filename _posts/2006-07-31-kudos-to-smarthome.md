I ordered some outdoor flicker lamps from [SMARTHOME - X10, Remote Control, Home Automation, Wireless Security, Lighting Control](http://www.smarthome.com/ "SMARTHOME - X10, Remote Control, Home Automation, Wireless Security, Lighting Control") and some of them were defective. In a cranky mood I filled out their post-sales survey, and was contacted promptly by them and they are sending me a new unit. It pays to complain I guess.
