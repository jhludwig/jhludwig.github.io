So after a week of playing with my new mac mini as my hometheater pc, i am mostly happy. I've configured it to grab downloaded AVIs (via bittorrent) off my windows file server -- the mac connected pretty easily to windows, in some ways it is easier than connecting two xp machines. [Per this guide](http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/avidivx.html), i installed vlc to play the downloaded avis -- works great. (Wow I had forgotten how easy it is to install apps on the mac).

Still looking for two things to complete the experience:

\* a great 10 foot ui for playing avis and dvds. Myth is overkill, i don't want all the pvr functionality, i just want the 10 foot UI. \* a wireless remote. I have the bluetooth kb and mouse but I want a remote. Maybe this [griffin airclick](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/airclick/index.php) tho it doesn't seem to be shipping yet?

So just a few more pieces and it will be perfect. And for once the mac is the price leader -- [compare with windows-based systems that people are building](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BuildingYourOwnWindowsMediaCenterEdition2005HomeTheaterPCSystem.aspx). And of course the mac is the style leader -- compare with [this ugly brute](http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/610/stealth_littlepc_lpc-401fs).
