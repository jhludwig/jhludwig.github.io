[![clouds](images/clouds-300x225.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/clouds.jpg)Did my first git push while in-flight! Awesome. Doesn't feel dirty at all!

Resisting temptation for lame cloud computing joke.

UPDATE: not surprisingly, I am also now a member of the mile-high "broke the build" club!! Along with the mile-high "you stupid jerk, now fix it" club.
