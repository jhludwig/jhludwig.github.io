- [Red Planet Blues](http://www.amazon.com/Red-Planet-Blues-Robert-Sawyer-ebook/dp/B009KUWYG4/) by Robert Sawyer. Noirish mystery on Mars. Fun and engaging. I hope Mars is this cool when we eventually settle it.
- [Odds Against Tomorrow](http://www.amazon.com/Odds-Against-Tomorrow-Nathaniel-Rich-ebook/dp/B00ANI9EMO/) by Nathaniel Rich. I don't enjoy reading farce, and this was drifting that way, but then the author made the characters very human despite being in the midst of a terrible tragedy. Surprised me in a good way.
- [The Darwin Elevator](http://www.amazon.com/Darwin-Elevator-Dire-Earth-Cycle-ebook/dp/B00BABT9VY/) by Jason Hough. A set of mysterious alien artifacts show up on Earth and shit breaks loose. A fun ride. The following two volumes -- Exodus Towers, Plague Forge -- lose a little of the energy, the author wasn't able to maintain the alien mystery, but still a fun set.
- [The St Zita Society](http://www.amazon.com/St-Zita-Society-Novel-ebook/dp/B0061NZUE6/) by Ruth Rendell. Rendell is a great author, and this book is well regarded, but it just didn't grab me, I gave up quite quickly. A rush of characters early that I didn't care about.
- [Dispute Over a Very Italian Piglet](http://www.amazon.com/Dispute-Over-Very-Italian-Piglet-ebook/dp/B00IOE3P2E/) by Amara Lakhous. This was a very engaging tale about corruption and bigotry in modern day Italy. Great main character, I'm left wanting more.
