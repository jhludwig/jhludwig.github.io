- [Interrupt](http://www.amazon.com/Interrupt-Jeff-Carlson-ebook/dp/B00B3V9GAA/) by Jeff Carlson. Apparently the publishing business is booming, because somebody thought this was worth horking out there. Poorly written, dumb characters, just ughh. save your brain. no idea why I downloaded this.
- [Killed at the Whim of a Hat](http://www.amazon.com/Killed-Whim-Hat-Mystery-Mysteries-ebook/dp/B004VMV3VS/) by Colin Cotterill. This is a very funny mystery set in Thailand. Awesome characters, great atmosphere. The GWB quotes sprinkled throughout are the cherry on the top.
- [Pereira Maintains](http://www.amazon.com/Pereira-Maintains/dp/B005H069JE/) by Antonio Tabucchi. In pre-WWII Portugal, Dr. Pereira awakens to rise of fascism. Starts slow, slowly accelerates, and ends on a bang.
- [Black Lamb and Grey Falcon](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Lamb-Grey-Falcon-Rebecca-ebook/dp/B000SEGMT6/) by Rebecca West. A fairly brilliant travelogue/history of the Balkans with deep insight about humanity everywhere. After reading this, I feel pretty shallow, this is a long and deep book.
