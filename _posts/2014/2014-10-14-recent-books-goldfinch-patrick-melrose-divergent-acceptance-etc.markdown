[The Goldfinch](http://www.amazon.com/Goldfinch-Donna-Tartt-ebook/dp/B00BAXFECK/) by Donna Tartt. A wild trip thru a life marked by disasters, some external, some self-created, with a lot of introspection about life along the way. Dense but I couldn't put it down. [![goldfinch](images/goldfinch.jpeg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/goldfinch.jpeg) [The Patrick Melrose Novels](http://www.amazon.com/Patrick-Melrose-Novels-Never-Mothers-ebook/dp/B00B8SAHJC) by Edward St. Aubyn. Very well written set of books about a life among the English upper class. Very engaging, tho the characters are all hateful, misanthropic, abusive people. I've stuck with it quite a while but ultimately the misanthropy is wearing me down. Glad these are not the circles I run in.

[On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City](http://www.amazon.com/Run-Fugitive-Fieldwork-Encounters-Discoveries-ebook/dp/B00JHCNVNU) by Alice Goffman. Really poorly written but great insight into life of an oppressed minority in America today. Very topical and inspirational.

[Divergent](http://www.amazon.com/Divergent-Trilogy-Book-1-ebook/dp/B004CFA9RS), [Insurgent](http://www.amazon.com/Insurgent-Divergent-Trilogy-Book-2-ebook/dp/B00655U3WE), [Allegiant](http://www.amazon.com/Allegiant-Divergent-Trilogy-Book-3-ebook/dp/B00BD99JMW) by Veronica Roth. Saw the first movie on a flight and thought it was fun. The first book is clearly the strongest, too much dithering about in the middle, but ends strong.

[Acceptance](http://www.amazon.com/Acceptance-Novel-Southern-Reach-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00ILWNU2E/) by Jeff VanderMeer. Brings the Southern Reach trilogy to a close. Finally, halfway thru this book, I finally tripped to what the major themes of the trilogy were. The third book gets a little too mystical at times but still a very engrossing (tho at times challenging) read.

[Letters of Note](http://www.amazon.com/Letters-Note-Collection-Correspondence-Deserving-ebook/dp/B00IPYLUO8) by Shaun Usher. Culled from the website, interesting insight into some historical figures.
