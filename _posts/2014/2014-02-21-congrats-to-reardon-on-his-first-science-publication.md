Quite an achievement -- [Dendritic Inhibition in the Hippocampus Supports Fear Learning](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6173/857.abstract) -- and won't be his last. I am jealous, I have aspired to go down the research path at many different points in my life but it has never worked out. Huge congrats!
