I buried this in a post the other day, bringing it to the fore. I am fortunate to be working with a [small team of great technical and business leaders](http://www.surround.io/), and we are ready to expand. [Drop us a note](info@surround.io) (or mail me directly) if you:

- are excited about Raspberry Pis, the internet of things, embedded systems, and pervasive computing
- have 2-5 years of hands-on experience in software development
- have background with linux systems development, mobile development, or cloud/web development
- as a bonus, have experience with image processing or computer vision
- are interested in being part of small dynamic focused collaborative no-nonsense team
- and are excited about joining an early stage startup with experienced technical and venture management

We are in the South Lake Union area of Seattle.
