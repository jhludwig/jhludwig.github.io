- [Angelmaker](http://www.amazon.com/Angelmaker-Nick-Harkaway-ebook/dp/B005IQZ7IG) by Nick Harkaway. A fun adventurous romp, reminds of the early Tim Powers books, but with a lighter touch.
- [Coldbrook](http://www.amazon.com/Coldbrook-Hammer-Tim-Lebbon-ebook/dp/B00FUZPQ2W) by Tim Lebbon. Many worlds and zombies, almost a perfect book :). [![coldbrook](images/coldbrook.jpeg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/coldbrook.jpeg)A great tale, I am a little surprised he hasn't penned a followup, tho some of the material might be off-putting to some readers.
- [Speedboat](http://www.amazon.com/Speedboat-NYRB-Classics-Renata-Adler-ebook/dp/B008LNWTXY) by Renata Adler. A stream of consciousness ramble. Not usually my style but I was engaged. The book has held up well.
- [Grasshopper Jungle](http://www.amazon.com/Grasshopper-Jungle-Andrew-Smith-ebook/dp/B007HU7LNK) by Andrew Smith. Zombies and giant bugs, another near perfect pairing. Not quite as engaging as the Lebbon but still quite fun.
