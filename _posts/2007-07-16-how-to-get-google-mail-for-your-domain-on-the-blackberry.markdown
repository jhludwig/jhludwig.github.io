[Scott Hanselman's Computer Zen](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheVerdictGoogleApplicationsForYourDomainTwoWeeksLater.aspx "Scott Hanselman's Computer Zen - The Verdict - Google Applications for your Domain Two Weeks Later") turned me onto the fact that you can get your google-hosted email on your blackberry: _"I almost like the BlackBerry Gmail app (note, there's two apps, one for Gmail and one for GAFYD - again with the Google Split Brain) better than the BlackBerry email itself."_. After spelunking around for a while, I found the [app download link](http://m.google.com/a). Very nice.
