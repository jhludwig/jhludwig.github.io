**RSS on PocketPC**. Steve Makofsky turned me onto his [PocketFeed](http://www.furrygoat.com/Programming/PocketFeed/index.aspx) RSS aggregator for the PocketPC. Wow this is great! The web has been nearly useless on my toshiba wifi pocketpc but this makes a huge difference. I haven't been a huge fan of RSS but it provides me a ton of utility on my small screen device. I use Radio to create my list of sources and then import the [OPML from Radio](http://www.theludwigs.com/radio/gems/mySubscriptions.opml) into the Pocketfeed app. Way cool!
