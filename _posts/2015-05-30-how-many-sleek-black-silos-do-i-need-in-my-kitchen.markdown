[![led-zeppelin-presence-1](images/led-zeppelin-presence-1-1024x685.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/led-zeppelin-presence-1.jpg)I have an Amazon echo. Now I [just installed the Canary](http://theludwigs.com/2015/05/canary-seems-like-a-better-dropcam-modulo-some-quality-issues/). I am sure Google and MSFT and everyone else wants to get their ambient computing module in my house. How many of these will I need to have?
