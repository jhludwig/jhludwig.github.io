And i bet MSFT wants to put chips in TVs, as well as a bunch of other companies. TV/tuner evolution is becoming interesting. \* [MSFT SP2 distribution -- why not just a torrent?](http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2004/8/9/121415.html) \* [The GMail filesystem.](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/08/29/0237213) Cool. \* [Emachine shop](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/08/24/EMachineShop.html).
