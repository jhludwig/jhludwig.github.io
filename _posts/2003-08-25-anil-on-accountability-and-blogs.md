A great articulation of one of the benefits of blogs -- [Six Log: Encouraging Accountability through Personal Publishing](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/07/encouraging_acc.shtml "Six Log: Encouraging Accountability through Personal Publishing"). I don't always communicate enough about my own decision processes on my blog, but when I do I tend to get great thoughtful feedback, feedback that helps to keep me grounded.
