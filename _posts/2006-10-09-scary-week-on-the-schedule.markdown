Remember [1974](http://www.buckeyextra.com/?story=139632 "BuckeyeXtra") when the #1 Buckeyes cruised into East Lansing and laid an egg. Or [1998](http://www.spartantailgate.com/2005/10/13/buckeye-fan-sites-predict-osu-win-over-msu/) when the Spartans came into Columbus and beat the #1 Buckeyes. You just never know what is going to happen with MSU. Scariest game left on the schedule ex Michigan of course.
