[Electroosmosis](http://www.chemsoc.org/ExemplarChem/entries/2003/leeds_chromatography/chromatography/eof.htm "Electroosmosis") -- good primer on electroosmotic flow. I never learned this stuff first time thru my education. The atomic and quantum level physics underlying materials behaviour is what I find currently fascinating.
