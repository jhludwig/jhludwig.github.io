\* With [Skype's recent announce of free outbound calling](http://www.betanews.com/article/Skype_Makes_Outbound_Calling_Free/1147711776), I should try one of [the cordless handsets available](http://share.skype.com/directory/hardware/) \* A Washington-based PC Mfr focused on silent PCs -- [endpcnoise](http://www.endpcnoise.com/) \* Rich is getting me excited about getting a higher end digital camera -- [shopping for the nikon d200](http://www.tongfamily.com/shopping_for_the_nikon_d200.php), [d200 vs 5d](http://www.tongfamily.com/d200_vs_5d_head_to_head.php), [canon lenses](http://www.tongfamily.com/canon_lenses.php). I've been taking a lot of sports photos and am feeling the need for better zoom, faster shutter response. \* The [ion usb turntable](http://blog.wired.com/music/index.blog?entry_id=1468415) -- cool. Though I only have 20 LPs left... \* [GPS tracker](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20060405/really-cool-portable-gps-tracker/). Not sure why I want this.
