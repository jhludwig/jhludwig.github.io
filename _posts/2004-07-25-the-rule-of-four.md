OK there are a lot of negative comments on amazon about [The Rule of Four](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385337116/qid=1090793277/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-3169122-2607830?v=glance&s=books&n=507846), but I liked it. The characters had a level of emotional depth and reality that made the story a lot better than a straight adventure story like The Davinci Code. Maybe the action wasn't as taut but overall a much more interesting read.
