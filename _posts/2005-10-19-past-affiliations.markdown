While at [Ignition](http://www.ignitionpartners.com), I've served on the board of Avogadro (since purchased by [Openwave](http://www.openwave.com)) and Wildseed (since purchased by [AOL](http://www.aol.com)).

Prior to Ignition I worked at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com), [Booz-Allen & Hamilton](http://www.bah.com), [Marion Power Shovel](http://www.roadtripamerica.com/places/marion.htm) (no longer operating), and L&K Restaurants (no longer operating).  While at Microsoft, I worked at various times on [MSN](http://www.msn.com), [Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx), [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx), [Windows for Workgroups](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/wfw/6_ch14.mspx), and [LAN Manager](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/Windows/2000/server/reskit/en-us/Default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/Windows/2000/server/reskit/en-us/w2000Msgs/4699.asp), along with a host of other things.

I'm an alum of [Carnegie-Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/), [The Ohio State University](http://www.osu.edu/), and [Marion Harding High School](http://www.marioncity.k12.oh.us/District/hard.htm).

Also I am glad I've been on an [Outward Bound](http://www.outwardbound.org/) trip.
