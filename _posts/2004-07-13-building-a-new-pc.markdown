I've been out of the country for 6 weeks and am just back to build a new PC. I am disappointed I can't yet get all the goodies I've been lusting for -- PCI Express, BTX motherboards, the new NVidia and ATI graphics cards -- it all seems to be vaporware. Fry's had to send back all the PCI Express motherboards they got from ASUS, i guess they were disasters. The graphics cards are nowhere to be seen. Bummer.
