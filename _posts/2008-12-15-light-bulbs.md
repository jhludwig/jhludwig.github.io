As much as I like these LED bulbs -- [New LED Light Bulbs Can Replace 100W Incandescents >> MetaEfficient Reviews](http://www.metaefficient.com/leds/led-light-bulbs.html). -- they are probably going to have to evolve a lot further in physical design before I can adopt them -- [like these CFL bulbs that look like incandescents](http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/12/11/ge-announces-cfl-bulb-in-new-incandescent-shape/) -- the incandescent shape is going to stay with us forever, just too many fixtures and designs have evolved around it.
