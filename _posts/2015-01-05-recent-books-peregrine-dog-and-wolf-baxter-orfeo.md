- [Miss Pregrine's Home for Peculiar Children](http://www.amazon.com/Miss-Peregrines-Home-Peculiar-Children-ebook/dp/B004FGMDOQ/) by Ransom [![HourBetweenDogandWolf_300dpi](images/HourBetweenDogandWolf_300dpi-197x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/HourBetweenDogandWolf_300dpi.jpg)Riggs -- basically, the X-Men in novel form. X-Men are more exciting tho this isn't terrible.
- [Proxima](http://www.amazon.com/Proxima-Stephen-Baxter-ebook/dp/B00INIJJAI/) by Stephen Baxter. Settling new planets isn't for sissies. Unless you find a magic wormhole.
- [The Hour Between Dog and Wolf](http://www.amazon.com/Hour-Between-Dog-Wolf-Transforms-ebook/dp/B0074VTH0W) by John Coates. Our "rational" behaviour is driven by our physical bodies and emotions in ways we are just understanding. Interesting but drags on.
- [Orfeo](http://www.amazon.com/Orfeo-Novel-Richard-Powers-ebook/dp/B00DX5XAA6) by Richard Powers. A biohacker, a terrorist, or just eccentric? Nicely written.
