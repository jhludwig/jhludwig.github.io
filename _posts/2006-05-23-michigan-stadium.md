From [Every Day Should Be Saturday](http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/?p=2078): _"The renovation seeks to add 83 indoor suites and 3,200 outdoor club seats, although overall capacity will only increase by about 750. There must be one hell of a market to watching punters develop in Ann Arbor."_

Awesome.
