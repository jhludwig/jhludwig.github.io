A bit of rain today which made my hike a little damp. My one essential piece of raingear is [the Seattle Sombrero](http://www.orgear.com/home/category/home/headware/rain_hats) -- I picked up at [REI](http://www.rei.com). This hat is great for Northwest weather -- a wide-enough brim to keep the drizzly rain out here off of almost my entire trunk. Won't go out without it.
