From today's [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all) on Apple's offshore manufacturing:

> "We sell iPhones in over a hundred countries", a current Apple executive said. "We don't have an obligation to solve America's problems. Our only obligation is making the best product possible."

I'm not completely angry about this view, this might be the correct and legitimate attitude for a multinational corporation. But it is clearly not the correct attitude for a US citizen and participant in the political process. Citizens do have an obligation to solve America's problems.
