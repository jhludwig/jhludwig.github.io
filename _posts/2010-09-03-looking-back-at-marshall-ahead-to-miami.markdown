Quality start for OSU last night. Diversified offense -- tight end and fullback catching balls! Pryor looked Rose-Bowl sharp. Defense was solid tho not as aggressive as you might hope -- but that will come as they gel. Special teams obviously need some work!

How optimistic should we be about Miami game? Miami also pushed around an overmatched opponent, winning 45-0 over FAMU.

\* Marshall is a much stronger program than FAMU (see "Sagarin ratings":http://www.usatoday.com/sports/sagarin/fbt10.htm). \* Miami had a nice offensive outing, 405 total yards. OSU was even better, 529 total yards. \* Miami gained 155 yards on the ground, 4.3 per carry. Nice but OSU gained 280 on the ground, 6.8 per carry. \* And of course the game is at Columbus.
