\* [The Enquirer - Bearcats](http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=SPT0101 "The Enquirer - Bearcats") -- coverage on the Cincinnati Enquirer website \* not much on the blog front for UC football -- [here's one](http://frontier.cincinnati.com/blogs/cincybearcats/) \* [Big Ten weekly release](http://bigten.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/091106aad.html) for general conference goodness.

The likely outcome this weekend is clear -- Cincinnati is probably overmatched physically, and has an inexperienced QB.
