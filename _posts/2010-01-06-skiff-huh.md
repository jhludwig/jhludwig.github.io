"Skiff e-reader targeted at magazines and newspapers":http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2010697015\_ces\_lg\_sprint\_launch\_skiff\_new.html -- OK I love gadgets and will try darn near anything, but this is a headscratcher for me. I love my Kindle because a) it is way easier to travel with than 5 books, and b) the e-books are generally cheaper than print books, and as a heavy reader, this is hundreds of dollars a year. I get huge payback because of these facts.

What payback will I get from Skiff? It won't be any easier to travel with than 5 magazines really -- magazines don't take much room, and I dispose of them as I go (to the degree that I read any magazines at all anymore). And magazines aren't that expensive, there is no way I can save that much money.

I understand the publishers are casting about for a lifesaver but this seems like a waste.
