I [used to think](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000504.html) that your PC sucked if you didn't have a water cooler. Well that is now for wimps, now you need to freeze your processer with a [Chip-Con](http://www.chip-con.com/index.php?pageid=14 "Chip-Con") freezer if you are any kind of a stud at all.
