[MAKE: Blog: Non-circular gears in motion](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/09/noncicular_gears_in_actio.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890) -- nice video. I've got a great set of books -- "Ingenious Mechanisms":amazon -- that show how to turn one form of motion into any other form using gears, cogs, etc. Amazing what you can do
