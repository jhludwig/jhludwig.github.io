BTW, big kudos to [Sea Ray](http://www.searay.com) and [Lake Union Sea Ray](http://www.lakeunionsearay.com/) for their help this last weekend with my [stupid battery issue](http://theludwigs.com/2009/08/oh-crap-my-searay-batteries-are-dead-and-i-cant-get-the-powered-engine-hatch-open-to-service-them/). The Lake Union service guys were very gracious on the phone talking me through things, even tho the last time they got revenue from me was in 1996 or so. And the Sea Ray customer service website had an issue with downloading manuals, and the Sea Ray guys were super responsive in debugging and also in getting me the manual out-of-band. All this on a weekend, and a very busy boating weekend at that. Appreciated.
