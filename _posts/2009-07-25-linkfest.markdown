\* [My Favorite Things Mars](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/07/my-favorite-things-mars.html). Amusing and entertaining \* [Why Nokia and Sony are failing](http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/24/why-nokia-and-sony-ericsson-are-failing/). Succinct. Complexity is a killer. \* [Inflatable buttons](http://www.core77.com/blog/technology/physical_interface_design_cmus_inflatable_buttons_will_be_a_gamechanger_14114.asp). Cool, not sure practical. \* [Computer Hardware Chart](http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/07/18/a-handy-dandy-computer-hardware-chart/). Periodic table of connectors \* [W\* house](http://www.wallpaper.com/whouse/). Your portal for great looking expensive sh$t. \* [Ford developing laser ignition](http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2009/07/14/ford-laser-ignition). Nice, car engines with laser beams! \* [WarrantyElephant](http://lifehacker.com/5299800/warrantyelephant-organizes-and-tracks-your-warranties). Idea is promising but site useless. I need something that will automatically find the warranty policy for my products and summarize my rights for me -- without me having to punch in the data myself. IE something akin to [ManualsOnline](http://www.manualsonline.com/) but for warranty info
