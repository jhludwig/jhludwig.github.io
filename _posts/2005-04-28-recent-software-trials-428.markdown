Failed:

\* Via [blackberryblog](http://blackberryblog.com/2005/04/19/new_rss_reader_for_blackberry.html), [litefeeds.com](http://www.litefeeds.com). Promised to be a nice RSS reader for the blackberry, and the blackberry client looked OK and installed easily. But lots of bugs on the server side handling my imported OPML so I gave up. \* [Olivelink](http://www.olivelink.com). Promised to be a way to easily share video with friends and family but like most of these apps, couldn't handle firewall/nat traversal without a bunch of tweaking, so i gave up.

Meaning to Try:

\* Alternatives to newsgator -- [intravnews](http://www.intravnews.com) and [You Subscribe](http://www.yousoftware.com). OK I love newsgator and it has been a rock for me, but worth looking around as I haven' gotten any new features from newsgator in a while. \* [orb](http://www.orb.com). Another videosharing app. [Blogmatrix](http://www.blogmatrix.com) might be worth trying too. \* [Flexwiki upgrade](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=315557). I use flexwiki for some personal projects and generally like it. Looks like a worthy upgrade.
