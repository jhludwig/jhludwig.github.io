Via [Phil Windley](http://www.windley.com/2003/06/10.html#a667 "Phil Windley | Weblogs: New Syndication Models Or Uncontrolled Platforms"), comments from Tony Perkins at the blogging conference. His observations -- _right now is the cheapest time to start an Internet company_ -- and simple rules -- _It's better to boot-strap than to go to board of director meetings; Build a community that advertisers care about; Create multiple revenue streams; Build a virtual team; Trust your gut, but listen to your readers_ \-- don't seem like such bad guidance for any software startup, not just media startups.
