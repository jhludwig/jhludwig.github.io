Been thinking about cabin life...

\* Two good coffee table books -- [The Getaway Home](http://mocoloco.com/archives/000709.php), [Living Outside Inside](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006074507X/ref=ord_1cl_log_ydet/102-4131696-2978514). \* [Embedding solar power into roof tiles](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,65413,00.html) -- fascinating development, every house should have this. \* [Kitchen Composters](http://sharp-world.com/corporate/news/040825.html) -- great product for septic-system based houses.
