**Weblogs for the Rest of Us**. Trying to get most of the [teaching staff to use weblogs](http://www.weblogg-ed.com/2002/12/05) appears to be a trial. I think the comment that "it is easier to use email than a blog" is very important -- if we want to rope in every user in our organizations, we need to get weblog use as easy as email.

There is a lot of inertia to email -- people stare at their inboxes all day and use that email editor all day. We need a plugin for our email products that just posts cleanly to a blog from the new message form. maybe you can just type in blog name in the TO: box.

And a plugin that lets you see responses and new blog items right in the email app, maybe right in your inbox.
