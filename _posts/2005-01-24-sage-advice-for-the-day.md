Via [Scott Loftesness](http://www.sjl.us/main/2005/01/a_longevity_str.html), William Safire's advice on his ending his NYTimes columns -- _"When you're through changing, you're through."_

And [John Zagula had a great meeting last week with Sidney Rittenberg](http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/01/21/twin_brothers_viability_and_contibution.html) -- _"Yes, the twin brothers of viability and contribution. Unless what you are doing is set up and made to be a viable enterprise, it won't survive. But unless what you are doing makes a real contribution it won't attract people, won't stay vibrant and won't last over the long run"_.

Great stuff.
