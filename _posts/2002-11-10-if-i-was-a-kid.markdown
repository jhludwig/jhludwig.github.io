**If I was a kid**. I'd want one of these for Christmas -- [french sloop model boat](http://www.zebrahall.com/z007-msf001.html) -- I love any sort of boat model. And a [chemistry](http://www.discoverthis.com/chemistry.html) set -- tho in these days of extreme product safety the sets have been terribly neutered. When I was a kid I used to build models and promptly blow them up with firecrackers -- combining these two great gifts into one merged orgy of creation and destruction. I am not really sure what this says about me but it is probably not good.
