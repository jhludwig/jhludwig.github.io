\* "[But then they went and wiped out a whole season's worth of disappointment in one glorious afternoon by spanking the Ugly Hats, 37-21.](http://www.danwismar.com/archives/wizblog/002628.html)" \* "[But there really is only one game on Ohio State's schedule and that's the Michigan Game. There are 10 scheduled pre-season games before the actual season starts.](http://adventuresofandy.blogspot.com/2004/11/michigan-20-ohio-state-37.html)"

**UPDATE**: [OSU officially headed to the Alamo Bowl](http://www.dispatch.com/football/football.php?story=dispatch/2004/11/23/bowl.html). Possible opponents -- Texas Tech, Texas A&M, Oklahoma State, Texas (longshot). Hard to believe that OSU has never played Texas, tho that will be remedied next year with the start of a home and away series.
