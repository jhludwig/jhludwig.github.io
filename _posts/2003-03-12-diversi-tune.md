**Diversi-Tune**. Wow is there a lot of karaoke software on the web. Astounding, clearly a huge interest area that I am not totally in tune with. We are trying out [Diversi-Tune](http://www.divtune.com/) -- we are putting some of our own words to a couple standards for some school follies. Bill at divtune has been super helpful too, sending me the info on how to edit the word files, the bouncing ball, etc.
