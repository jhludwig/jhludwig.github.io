[The Furrygoat Experience: WikiPad](http://www.furrygoat.com/archives/000833.html "The Furrygoat Experience: WikiPad") -- looks cool but the last thing i want is a client app that locks up all its data on one of my machines. I need a real server wiki that has a great editting frontend like wikipad.
