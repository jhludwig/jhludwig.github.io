\* "Tilt-shift Van Gogh":http://www.artcyclopedia.com/hot/tilt-shift-van-gogh.htm via "Scalzi":http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/09/23/your-whoa-dude-moment-for-today/. Because tilt-shift makes everything better. \* "6502 simulated in javascript":http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/index.html via "adafruit":http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2010/09/18/6502-visual-simulator/. Freaking awesome, my first significant personal coding was on a 6502 (Apple \]\[), I wish I still had the code so I could test it out. \* "Glass speakers":http://www.gstspeakers.com/. Outrageously expensive but oh my gosh cool. \* "Carlashes":http://www.carlashes.com/. To be surreptitiously applied to your sibling's car.
