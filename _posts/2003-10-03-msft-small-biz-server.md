[Microsoft Tweaks Its Small Biz Server Plans](http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,4248,1231813,00.asp "Microsoft Tweaks Its Small Biz Server Plans") -- I ran small biz server for a while at my home and, well, it was just a big productivity suck. So much software, so much to configure, doing the simplest things was made hard. Maybe the new version is better tho the fact that they are upping the CAL limit seems to suggest they are moving up market with the product and away from simplicity.
