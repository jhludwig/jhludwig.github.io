- [The Beatle Lyrics](http://www.amazon.com/Beatles-Lyrics-Unseen-Story-Behind-ebook/dp/B00I8289CI), edited by Hunter Davies. Not a terrible addition to the Beatles literature, but not great either. The discussion of the lyrics is not very deep, which might be ok, but the discussion of what was going on with the writers at the time is also thin. Just OK.[![stonesfall](images/stonesfall-200x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/stonesfall.jpg)
- [The Sisters Brothers](http://www.amazon.com/Sisters-Brothers-Patrick-DeWitt-ebook/dp/B004CFA91Y) by Patrick deWitt. Fantastic Old West characters, I loved the two brothers. The tale started out strong and kind of petered out, but memorable characters.
- [Wool Omnibus Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Wool-Trilogy-Hugh-Howey-ebook/dp/B0071XO8RA) by Hugh Howey. OK we don't really need any more near future post apocalyptic dystopia novels, but this was fun.
- [Stone's Fall](http://www.amazon.com/Stones-Fall-Iain-Pears-ebook/dp/B001NLL0JA) by Iain Pears. Well this was twisty and fun. Deception and intrigue across several generations in the 1900s.
- [Zoo City](http://www.amazon.com/Zoo-City-Lauren-Beukes-ebook/dp/B003ZSIT0M) by Lauren Beukes. Near future science fiction set in South Africa, not the usual setting for most books available here in US.
- [Tanglewreck](http://www.amazon.com/Tanglewreck-Jeanette-Winterson-ebook/dp/B0055S2GT0) by Jeanette Winterson. Someone recommended this as a great YA title, but I thought it was a bit of a mess.
- [Unseen](http://www.amazon.com/Unseen-Will-Trent-Atlanta-Book-ebook/dp/B00AXIZ3HE) by Karin Slaughter. How does this thing get good reviews on Amazon, it is a poorly written mess. Gave up on quickly.
- [The Terror of Living](http://www.amazon.com/Terror-Living-Urban-Waite-ebook/dp/B00495ZE3A) by Urban Waite. Smuggling on the Canadian border goes very very wrong.
