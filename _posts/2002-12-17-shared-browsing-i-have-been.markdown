**Shared Browsing**. I have been using the Application Sharing feature of MSN Messenger a lot recently. It is a great homework and college app tool, we can sit together and look at online apps, or at various homework searches. But there are some things I hate about it. A, it is such overkill. Tons of code loads and then the entire app window gets scraped, rendered into some protocol, and sent remotely, where a ton of code on the other machine receives and rerenders. B, it is so squirelly. All kinds of paint problems on the receiving end -- Windows just doesn't seem that happy with this crazy idea. C, the interface is absolutely unintelligible. I only understand it because, well, I used to manage the team. My kids think it is the goofiest software. I can't even imagine explaining it to my dad.

I'd like a simpler, lighter-weight solution. The data I really need to pass between machines is just the URL, cookie data, and some SSL data i think. Looking for solutions on the web -- [ezWebCar](http://www.ezwebcar.com/Faq.asp#Co-Browsing) \-- hmm doesn't handle ssl, maybe for good reasons. But makes it useless for college apps. [Talisma](http://www.talisma.com/products/browsing.asp) has a product which handles SSL but seems enterprise focused. There are other enterprise focused solutions floating around too like Wicom. Then there are classroom focused solutions like [webwisdom](http://www.webwisdom.com/Products/vclassroom.html). But way heavier than I need.

Maybe I should go lower-tech and just use a combo of [KVM boxes and splitters](http://www.42u.com/video_splitters.htm) to share the screen. Probably would be more robust than all the software solutions.
