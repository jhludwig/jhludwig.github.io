[Jonathan Schwartz's Weblog](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20040925#1_hr_computing_arrives "Jonathan Schwartz's Weblog") -- he talks about a 32-way niagara system using only 56-60 watts. I am hungry for low power and low heat solutions, the current state of PC hardware is a little ridiculous.

Nice review of [ExpertsExchange](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/09/23/ExpertsExchange.html) \-- an interesting little community and microeconomy -- I should participate.

[Ethan Zuckerman](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/2004/09/27#a356) on systematic bias in Wikipedia, another interesting community/microeconomy. I'd be more likely to participate in either of these if I could crosspost content easily to my blog -- I'd like to be building my blog at the same time as I build these other assets.

[Integrating blogs into customer service](http://www.rafer.net/blog/000292.html) -- going in a different direction now, interesting thinking about how a company can harvest blog content for product reviews and problem reports.

[From the J-Curve](http://jurvetson.blogspot.com/2004/09/transcending-moores-law-with-molecular.html), I think steve is saying that Moore's Law is for wussies.

[Handicapping the Nobel Prize for Economics](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/09/who_will_win_th.html) -- fascinating reading, especially for an amateur economist like myself.
