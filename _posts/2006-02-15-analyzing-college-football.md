It pains me to [link to the blog of an obvious Michigan fan](http://mgoblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/zen-and-science-of-third-down.html), but he has earned my admiration: _"Also: I'm taking requests. I have a database of most plays/drives that happened in D-I last year. If you've got any ideas as to how to use it, I'm listening. If you know SQL and would like to try something out yourself (Bueller? Bueller?), I can give you a public login."_ Studly.

Michigan still sucks but this guy is cool.
