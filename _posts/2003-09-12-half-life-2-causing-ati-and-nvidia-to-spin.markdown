[Blue's News: Message Board](http://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&threadid=44138 "Blue's News: Message Board") -- the upcoming release of Half-life 2 is causing a lot of frenzy in the video card industry. Gabe at Valve currently seems to recommend the ATI 9800, tho Nvidia is spinning hard. It is fascinating that the release of a single game can cause so much angst, and as a user it is great to see these vendors trying to kill each other because I am going to get much faster video cards as a result.  
  
Meanwhile Valve has released the new [Steam client](http://www.steampowered.com) and the website is DOA, i assume it is getting hammered with traffic, so that is good for Valve.
