Spent part of yesterday being deposed on a matter that I can't talk about which happened during my tenure at MSFT. Hard to imagine that these issues are still dragging on, my remembrance of the events 10+ years in the past is pretty poor. It was kind of humorous to be reminded of issues that we fought like cats and dogs about -- in retrospect none of them amounted to a hill of beans.
