Rand details "his recent fund raising experience":http://randfishkin.com/blog/128/misadventures-venture-capital-funding#more-128. The guy is admirably open, much to learn from this.

I'm not sure I have it in me to be that open -- partly thru painful experience, partly my bias that information advantages are valuable (which makes me sound like a jerk compared to Rand, which may be true). But Rand's approach is inspiring and motivating.
