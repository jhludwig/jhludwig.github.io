I find this article fascinating -- [One Music Label or Several? Pearl Jam Weighs Options](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/14/business/media/14JAM.html?ex=1373515200&en=44a9267d39e70cc4&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND "One Music Label or Several? Pearl Jam Weighs Options"). Pearl Jam has found a way to create a constantly renewable, inexpensive source of content -- their nightly recordings. Given the file sharing networks, you have to wonder if more bands don't move to live recordings as their primary recorded output, instead of studio recordings. Studio recordings are expensive to make, and in a sense they discourage consumption of live music. Pearl Jam seems to making the right steps as artists to respond to file sharing networks, by emphasizing the live experience and unique (and low incremental cost to produce) recordings from these live experiences.
