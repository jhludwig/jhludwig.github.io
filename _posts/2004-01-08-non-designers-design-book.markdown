[Amazon.com: Books: The Non-Designer's Design Book, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321193857/qid=1073609664//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/002-7951548-5831249?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: The Non-Designer's Design Book, Second Edition") -- good quick intro to design principles, primarily for the printed page, but a little for websites too. Not that it will help my page but still nice to know in greater depth what I am screwing up.
