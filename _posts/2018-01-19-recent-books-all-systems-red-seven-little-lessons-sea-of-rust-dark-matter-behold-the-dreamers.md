- [All Systems Red](https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Kindle-Single-Murderbot-Diaries-ebook/dp/B01MYZ8X5C) by Martha Wells. A fun romp with cyborgs, planetary exploration, betrayal, friendship. Short and sweet. Apparently a longer novel form coming out this year.[![](images/32758901-188x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2018/01/recent-books-all-systems-red-seven-little-lessons-sea-of-rust-dark-matter-behold-the-dreamers/attachment/32758901/)
- [Seven Brief Lessons on Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Brief-Lessons-Physics-Rovelli/dp/0399184414) by Carlo Rovelli. Super quick walk thru the major issues in physics today, well written and crisp.
- [Sea of Rust](https://www.amazon.com/Sea-Rust-C-Robert-Cargill-ebook/dp/B01MRWLGD9) by C. Robert Cargill.  Humans are extinct, robots rule the world, and they are just as petty, noble, nasty, friendly, loving, and vicious as humans ever were.
- [Dark Matter](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Matter-Novel-Blake-Crouch-ebook/dp/B0180T0IUY) by Blake Crouch.  Fun multiverse adventure, exploring the role of the observer in controlling the multiverse.  Seems like the author is working hard to get this to film, would be fun.
- [Behold the Dreamers](https://www.amazon.com/Behold-Dreamers-Oprahs-Book-Club-ebook/dp/B0138OAB80) by Imbolo Mbue.  Immigrants trying to find their way in America during the 2008 financial crisis.  The good, bad, and ugly of being an immigrant in America, and a story of success and failure and resignation and acceptance.
