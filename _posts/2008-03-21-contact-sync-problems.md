[Arrgh my contacts are gooneee! | Tongfamily.com](http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2008/03/20/arrgh-my-contacts-are-gooneee/) -- poor rich. I am having the same problems too. Fundamentally the problem is too many codebases trying to manage contact data, trying to sync contact data. And all these codebases go in and munge the contact data rather than just treating it as an opaque blob. same problem with calendar data. i am looking forward to the iphone directly syncing with exchange so i can get all these other pieces of code out of the equation.
