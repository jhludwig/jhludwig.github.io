**Tucson Trip**

We had a great trip down to Tucson and Scottsdale last week. It is our so-called "Mid Winter Break" or "Ski Week" -- a week off from school in mid February. We get spring break later in April.

We had beautiful weather -- approaching 80 each day, but cool at night. C and Liz stayed at [Canyon Ranch](http://www.canyonranch.com/tucson/index.asp), John and John at [Loew's Ventana Canyon Resort](http://www.loewshotels.com/hotels/tucson/default.asp). Canyon Ranch is awesome, "camp for grownups", but they have an age limit of 14 so we can't all go there yet.

While the girls were spa-ing, John and John hit all the tourist attractions in Tucson including [Old Tucson Studios](http://www.oldtucson.com/) \-- fun old west stunt shows, a real hoot.

Everyone is back in school and or work today, 6 weeks to spring break!
