Despite losing two games to MSU and Nebraska, OSU can control its own destiny in the Big10 race. If OSU wins out, they will have 2 losses in the Leaders division.

\* Wisconsin will have at least two losses -- MSU and OSU -- and thus would lose a tiebreaker to OSU \* Purdue would have at least two losses, including one to OSU, and thus would lose the tiebreaker. OK, seriously tho, Purdue will have many more losses. \* Illinois would have at least two losses, and would lose the head-to-head tiebreaker with OSU. \* The only stretch is Penn State. They'd have one loss to OSU, and then you have to accept they will lose at least one more, and they stil have Illinois, Nebraska, and Wisconsin on the schedule. Fairly reasonable to expect them to drop another.

OK, so this edition of the Buckeyes may not have it in them to get it done this season, but even having a chance is surprising.
