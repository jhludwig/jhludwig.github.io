A bag of stuff I've read recently that was compelling:

\* "Coffee as economic health indicator":http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2010/05/coffee\_as\_city.html. Yay Seattle! Contrast with... \* "World Class Orchestras":http://reason.com/archives/2010/05/24/how-to-save-cleveland \* "McKean's Inversion":http://whatever.scalzi.com/2011/08/11/mckeans-inversion/. Whatever you publicly espouse to be -- you probably aren't. \* "Wicked Problems":http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2011/07/wicked-1.html. \* "A one page explanation of the Higgs boson":http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2011/07/26/the-higgs-boson-a-one-page-explanation/ \* On the lighter side, "Bacon Ipsum":http://design-milk.com/bacon-ipsum/.
