Settings...general...keyboard...shortcuts. Love these, will save me infinite amount of typing. Completing web forms, email, everywhere.

But why oh why aren't these iCloud enabled? I want the same exact shortcuts on my iPad, iPhone, and Mac. And I don't want to have to re-enter them on each device. The lack of multiple device support is exactly why I've given up on so many other text expanders over time, if I can't depend on text expansion working the same way on all my devices, then it just isn't that useful.

Here's hoping that that Apple fixes this in a future release.
