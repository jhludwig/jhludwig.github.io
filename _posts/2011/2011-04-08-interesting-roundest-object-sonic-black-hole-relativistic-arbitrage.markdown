\* "Roundest Object In The World":http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2011/02/14/roundest-object-in-the-world-the-avogadro-project/. I could so bowl 300 with one of these. \* "Sonic Black Hole":http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-01-physicists-sonic-black-hole-lab.html. Bring one of these to your next meeting, watch hilarity ensue. \* "Relativistic Statistical Arbitrage":http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/04/relativistic-statistical-arbitrage.html?utm\_source=feedburner&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=Feed%3A+marginalrevolution%2Ffeed+%28Marginal+Revolution%29. This is why I would make a crappy day trader, I always forget to include relativistic effects.
