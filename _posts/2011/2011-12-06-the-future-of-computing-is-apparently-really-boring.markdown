So I read the "NYTimes Future of Computing Science section":http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/the-future-of-computing/?src=twrhp today and was pretty underwhelmed. The presentation of the articles was incredibly dull with almost no visualization. The articles themselves were mostly soporific. The quantum computing article told me nothing. The bioengineering article didn't inspire. Nothing else did anything for me. I usually like the Science Times section but this was the most boring edition of the year, and I'm not the only one who thinks this way, the non-nerds in the house agree.

It is way more inspiring to play with the latest video games, or to play with the latest devices and apps, or to talk with young entrepreneurs. I'm surprised at how dull the topic seemed in the Times. This edition will not inspire any young people to enter the field.
