Nice writeup of "Apple's manufacturing/supply advantage vs the PC OEMs":http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/new\_apple\_advantage. Reminds me very much of the way Honda and Toyota crushed the American car manufacturers in the 70's and 80's -- GM in particular had overly complex product lines, cars with a gajillion options. Honda came in with a simple model, no options, and great great quality, and just crushed GM in core markets. Product line complexity comes at a huge cost, Apple is playing this hand well.
