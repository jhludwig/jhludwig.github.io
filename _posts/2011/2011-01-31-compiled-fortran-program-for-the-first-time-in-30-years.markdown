[![](images/pcard-300x135.jpg "Punch Card")](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/pcard.jpg)I had forgotten how ugly Fortran could be, tho it has gotten a lot prettier since 1979/1980.

And it caused me to reflect on all the programming languages I have used over the years, starting from my earliest days...

\* TI-59, whatever language that thing used. I had no idea what I was doing really but was intrigued. \* Fortran. Yay punchcards. \* COBOL. ugh. \* Basic in many forms. Apple's Integer Basic was maybe the first, or maybe the Basic on the TI 99/4 \* PL/1. bad memories here. A command for everything, programming was an exercise in finding the right command. \* ASM in 6501, 68k, and x86 flavors at least. I am sure there were a few more in there too. probably my first in depth coding. \* Forth. always thought it was interesting. \* Pascal. \* C and a little C++ tho the C++ came much later of course. still as comfortable in c as anything. \* APL. what a terrible idea for a language! unreadable 10 minutes after you looked away from it. impossible to type. \* dBase. ok barely a language but useful. \* Hypertalk. never anything serious but always fun. \* So many batch language variants I can't remember. \* Javascript. \* Java. never did much with. \* Perl. learned enough to deal with movable type at one point, never loved it. \* PHP. \* Python. still learning. mostly interested in scientific use with numpy/scipy. \* MatLAB.

Sure I missed some. Probably forgot some on purpose due to the pain they caused.
