[![](images/spalding-leather-football-helmet-235x300.jpg "spalding-leather-football-helmet")](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/spalding-leather-football-helmet.jpg)Kirk Cousins, the returning MSU QB, got all kinds of kudos over the last week for his nice speech about what a privilege it is to play college football, but I am underwhelmed. As others point out -- "Kirk Cousins and Privilege":http://www.elevenwarriors.com/2011/08/kirk-cousins-privledge -- Kirk is letting himself be used by the monied powers in the system to protect their interests. The schools, the NCAA, the media companies are making billions of dollars off of college sports, and throwing peanuts to the players. And the players don't even have a voice in the system -- maybe the players would vote to spend all the proceeds from their sports on non-revenue sports, on university facilities, on salaries for university staffers, etc -- but shouldn't they at least have a say? Kirk, being part of a football team at a good college is a great experience, but that doesn't change the fact that you are being used.

Frank Deford says it well -- "Frank Deford on amateurism":http://www.npr.org/2011/08/03/138919312/ncaa-still-stalled-by-amateur-hour-thinking. The time has come to abandon the amateurism requirement for college athletes in the revenue sports. A family friend made this same argument to me today in an email, I am all for it.

Other college football reading today -- "Bodog season win total odds":http://sports.bodog.eu/sports-betting/college-football-team-props.jsp (hattip @darrenrovell). OSU and Wisconsin both at 9. I'd take the over on both.
