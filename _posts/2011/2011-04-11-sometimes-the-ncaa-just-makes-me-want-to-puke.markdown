Completely totally 100% agree with "this gentleman":http://blutarsky.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/sometimes-the-ncaa-just-makes-me-want-to-puke/.

I don't understand how anyone with a straight face can propose to generate yet more incremental revenue off the revenue sport athletes, without proposing anything regarding greater compensation for the players. This proposal will generate more money for media companies, for entertainment companies, for advertisers, for the NCAA, for schools. And $0 for the athletes involved. The athletes don't even get to have a say in the process.

Nuts.

BTW, al.com is running a nice series on "the treatment of players in division 1 revenue sports":http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2011/04/college\_athletes\_rights\_who\_fi.html. Worth a read. And nice pointes to "oversigning.com":http://oversigning.com/testing/ and the related site "Parents of Players":http://www.parentsofplayers.com/.
