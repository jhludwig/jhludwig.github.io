Here's what I'd like to see:

\* _Start Me Up_ by the Rolling Stones from Tattoo You LP \* _Tattoo_ by Jordin Sparks \* _I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire_ by The Ink Spots \* _Dancing With Myself_ by Billy Idol, themesong from LA Ink \* _Last Tattoo_ by Rehab

If our band was the Stanford band, you know this would happen. But then our band would suck.
