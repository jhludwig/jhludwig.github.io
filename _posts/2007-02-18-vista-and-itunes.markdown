Man [this is pissing me off](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305042). I would avoid Vista, even on OEM machines, until Apple and MSFT get this fixed.

I'm pissed off at Microsoft. They jammed all this new media playing goo into Vista, and have all this ambition around Zune, but they haven't made sure that the most important, most used music playing experience works well with Vista. They let their ambition and ego get ahead of their customers.

I'm pissed off at Apple. Vista has been in beta for like forever, and Apple couldn't figure out how to get iTunes upgraded in time for consumer release? Everyone was too freaking busy on the iphone or what? Again they let ego and ambition get in the way of supporting customers.

It is really bad. We are constantly rebooting our Vista machine with iTunes.

Jerks.
