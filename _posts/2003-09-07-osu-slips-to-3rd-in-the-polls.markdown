[NCAA College Football - Fanblogs.com: 2003 Week 4 Coaches Poll](http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/archives/000263.php "NCAA College Football - Fanblogs.com: 2003 Week 4 Coaches Poll") -- desrvedly so, yesterday's performance was so weak. I am surprised they didn't slip lower.  
  
#6 in the [Sagarin (BCS)](http://www.usatoday.com/sports/sagarin/fbt03.htm) -- I have no real beef with that.
