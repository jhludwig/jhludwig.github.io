[Amazon.com: Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation): Kindle Store](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Generation/dp/B00154JDAI). - damn my family has theirs already. Apparently all shipped out of Indianapolis and so Midwest buyers already have their hands on. First reports are that it comes preloaded with all your existing book purchases, that is awesome.
