From the [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993796 "New Scientist"): _Young male salmon raised in fish farms mate more aggressively than their counterparts in the wild._

We ate at a premier seafood restaurant in Seattle last night and it was hard to get non-farmed salmon. Out of about 9 salmon dishes, only one was line-caught. Sad. And the menu totally obscures this by calling the farm-raised salmon "Pacific Northwest Salmon" on all the dishes -- you have to ask a lot of questions to find out that this is == farm raised Atlantic salmon from farms in BC.
