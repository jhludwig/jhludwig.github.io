I've given up on comcast [fixing their IP lease time issues](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001813.html), I am still seeing very short lease times a week+ later.

I have found that my old sonicwall firewall was particularly perturbed by these short leases, so i replaced it with a [Linksys WRV54G](http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=35&prid=565) that I had purchased a while ago. No amount of coercion could make it work with the xbox tho -- i tried port forwarding, turning on and off upnp, assigning the xbox a static ip and putting it into the dmz, etc. Just never clicked.

So I printed out [Microsoft's advice on compatible routers](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/connect/routerlanding.htm) and trundled off to Fry's this AM. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Microsoft's list is very stale, not a single router with these model numbers is actually for sale anymore. So i picked up a [dlink DI-704UP](http://www.dlink.com/products/?sec=1&pid=272) \-- I know dlink has great market share, and the number was similar to a router that was supposed to be compatible. Works fine.
