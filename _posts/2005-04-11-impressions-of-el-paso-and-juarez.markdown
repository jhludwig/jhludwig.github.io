\* El paso was dusty, hot, and windy. So brown compared to seattle. \* Stayed at a decent hotel in downtown el paso -- [the camino real](http://www.caminoreal.com/elpaso_i/index.html). An oasis of higher income activity in the downtown. \* Downtown lively in day -- every store rolls their wares out onto the street. But absolutely dead at night. And no one speaks English -- I felt like a fish out of water. \* You need to head out to the northern or eastern burbs for restaurants, shopping. I ate dinner at the [State Line BBQ](http://www.guestlife.com/elpaso/dine/dinestate.html) -- it was decent. Good potato salad. \* [UTEP](http://www.utep.edu) is on some hills overlooking the downtown. Banner year for men's sports, both the bball and fball teams did well. The [Sun Bowl](http://www.sunbowl.org/) is played here annually. \* You can walk into Juarez for 35 cents. I spent Saturday morning wandering into Juarez. I was wondering "why do people visit Juarez?". I wasn't 25 feet across the border before I had my first Viagra offer. The main tourist street was lined with pharmacies. At 100 feet a cab driver offered to take me to a woman. \* It took about 8-10 blocks of walking to punch thru this part of Juarez into the market area with more normal shops, bakeries, restaurants, etc. Much more pleasant.

Net/net, can't say I'd ever want to come to a sun bowl.
