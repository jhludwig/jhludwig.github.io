I'm listening a lot to their latest album. Well the Lindsay Buckingham tracks anyway, I can't stand the Nicks compositions or the performance. It is cool that they let you download the first single -- [Fleetwood Mac single download | How It Works](http://www.repriserecords.com/fleetwoodmac/downloadsingle/page2.html "Fleetwood Mac single download | How It Works") -- using paypal for just $1.49. Way better option than making me subscribe to some music service.
