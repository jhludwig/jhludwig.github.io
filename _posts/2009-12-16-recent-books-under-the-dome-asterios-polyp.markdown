\* "Under the Dome":amazon by Stephen King. An impermeable dome settles over a New England town, and Lord of the Flies/Kristallnacht ensues. No supernatural baddies here, just ill-behaved humans. Ultimately there is a supernatural cause for the dome, but all the real evil in the book is 100% human in origin. Somewhat entertaining but very very long. Amazon says 3.5 stars, a shorter crisper version might have warranted more.

\* "Asterios Polyp":amazon by David Mazzucchelli. A very grown up graphic novel. Asterios lives a self-absorbed life, but late in life starts to reflect on his path and what he really values. A very compelling tale. Super easy to get through but packed with insight. Amazon says 4.5 stars, I'm good with that.
