Rich has shamed me a little unintentionally -- [he's been a posting madman](http://www.tongfamily.com/travel/judys_book.php) up at [Judy's Book](http://www.judysbook.com) and has like 80 more posts than I do. I just added a handful of reviews tonight, I am determined to catch up with Rich.

I am threatening to pull well ahead of him on an investment that is currently in steath beta tho. A little internal competition is healthy.
