I get a lot of visitors looking for info on the best college stadiums. Well here are some pointers to web resources:

\* [College Stadiums Football Photos 8x10](http://www.hhweb.com/stadiumphotos_college.htm "College Stadiums Football Photos 8x10") -- nice aerial and in-stadium photos for a lot of the top stadiums. Great gift for fans. \* [NCAA attendance stats for 2005](http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/Internet/attendance/ia_attendance.html) -- a loud full stadium is a good stadium \* [Saturday Shrines](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892048050/102-3127790-0050535?v=glance&n=283155) on Amazon. \* [Fanblogs points to](http://www.fanblogs.com/big12/003365.php) Dennis Dodd's 2003 rankings which I think are crap. [Fanblogs also points to the Rivals 05 rankings](http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/005536.php) which I like better. \* [Sporting News/MSNBC rankings](http://www.msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/) here which I also wonder about. \* [Football Digest rankings](http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCL/is_4_32/ai_94123522) -- I can get behind these!

My view is -- any full loud stadium on a Saturday afternoon or evening is a great place to be. I haven't been to that many, but my views on a few:

\* Ohio Stadium -- great crowd, great band, great pageantry, great architecture. A+. What did you think I'd say? \* Michigan Stadium -- great crowd, but kind of characterless architecture. B+ \* ASU in Tempe. What a great setting. Too bad the team isn't consistently better. B+ \* UW. Another great setting, but a team that is a snoozer. Still where else can you moor your boat for a tailgate picnic? B \* Rose Bowl. Great potential but too many empty seats -- not being on campus hurts. B- \* Pitt Stadium. Great location, right in the thick of things. Great crowds, inconsistent team. B
