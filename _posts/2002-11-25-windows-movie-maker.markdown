**Windows Movie Maker Beta**. Finally downloaded this and started playing with. The pros -- lots easier to use and less buggy than a lot of the shovelware you find with vidcap cards and with systems. A huge con-- it is impossible to discern what codecs it is using, or to force it to use a particular codec. I want to share a move with some folks over the web, and they are using unknown systems. How can I pick the exact codec I want, how can I pick the most compatible cross platform codec? If I want to force it to use DivX, how do I do that?
