[![](images/439068611_joZ5y-Th.jpg "John and Cristi Snowstorm 2008")](http://jhludwig.smugmug.com/photos/439068611_joZ5y-XL.jpg)OK it was all cute and everything the first day and we got some nice pictures. But now I've had enough. A frozen pipe. A tree that failed under the weight of all the snow. An epic driving trip to the airport last night. Time to move on.

Oh and huge thanks to all those who didn't take snow days and kept on keeping the world running. Our paper arrived every day. The mailman was always here. Our lights, heat, water, phone, TV, internet service all worked like champs. The roads were plowed. UPS showed up. Grocery always open. Starbucks usually open. And many many more -- hats off to everyone.
