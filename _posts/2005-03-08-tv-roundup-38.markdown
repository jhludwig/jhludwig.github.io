\* [Thomas Hawk summarizes](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=1004) a great Barron's article on the state of the industry. Suggests the cable operators are the ones to beat -- that certainly seems to be the conventional wisdom. \* an Ebay plugin for [Windows Media Center Edition](http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=117 ) -- with the popularity of shopping channels, this seems like such an obviously good idea. \* [Centerstage](http://centerstageproject.com/) is apparently going to go alpha this weekend -- great news for mac minis.
