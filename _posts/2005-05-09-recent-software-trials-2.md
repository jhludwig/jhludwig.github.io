\* From [sifry](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000309.html), tried out the latest version of [ecto](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/). it seems to handle textile2 formatting now or any other movable type text processor plugin, nice. \* Thanks to [Scott](http://www.enslabs.com/), I'm trying out exchange rpc over http -- no more vpn'ing into work! Seems stable, maybe a little slower than a vpn connection. \* [Nice tip from ed bott](http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=277) on how to find out what code is hiding inside of svchost.exe instances. Now I need a decoder ring for all these widgets. \* i'd love to try out [mylifebits](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=1337) \* [a cool mac widget for seeing what's on your tivo](http://www.internet-nexus.com/2005_05_08_archive.htm#111558822554507320) -- i really have to upgrade my tivo.
