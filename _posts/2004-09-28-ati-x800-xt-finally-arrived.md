We've been waiting for this part since July. Finally arrived -- after trying to order from many different sources, it was good old [compusa](http://www.compusa.com) that finally delivered.

Installed it last night along with [Call of Duty expansion (CODUO)](http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/callofdutyunitedoffensive/) and the bullets were flying. Frame rates wonderful. Love the new bigger maps in CODUO.
