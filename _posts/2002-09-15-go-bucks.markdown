**Go Bucks!** Nice win yesterday over Wazzu -- all my wazzu alum associates out here are in disbelief. For my Ohio friends, check out the coverage at the [Seattle Times](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/134536032_coug15.html) and [here](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/134536033_cougnotes15.html) too. Oh and check out [Gesser whining](http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=091502&ID=s1216756&cat=section.sports) in the Spokane paper.
