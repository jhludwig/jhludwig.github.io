**Best School Websites**. Forest Ridge recently posted a new version of their website, which is good, and I want to help them make it even better. I am starting to canvas the web for great school websites. The NSPA denotes [these](http://www.studentpress.org/nspa/winners/opm02.html) as the best. And some others from the [OJR](http://www.ojr.org/ojr/highschool/1023218784.php).
