Nice quote here: "He who blames others has a long way to go on his journey. He who blames himself is halfway there. He who blames no one has arrived." - Chinese proverb, via [Millionaires Say They Were Failed by Advisers in Crisis | The Big Picture](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2009/01/millionaires-say-they-were-failed-by-advisers-in-crisis/).
