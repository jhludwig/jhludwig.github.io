Random posts that have caught my eye recently:

\* [The VC Math Problem](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/04/the-venture-capital-math-problem.html) -- excellent discussion of the "macroeconomics" of the VC asset class. \* [What to fear](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/04/what_to_fear.html). The truth about what is going to kill you. The sensationalist news stories every night on random acts of violence and tragedy are scary, but they aren't the threat. \* [The Rhythms of My Life](http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2009/03/the-rhythms-of-life.html). One guy's methodology for examining his life and how he lives it. Not the right methodology for everyone, but everyone probably needs some methodology.
