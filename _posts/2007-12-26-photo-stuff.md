\* [Video Demonstration: The Rules of Photography Composition](http://lifehacker.com/337117/the-rules-of-photography-composition "Video Demonstration: The Rules of Photography Composition"). good 2 minute primer \* [Liquid lenses](http://www.crunchgear.com/2007/12/22/liquid-lenses-work-like-your-eyes-but-dont-cut-out-your-eyes-yet/). I think we are still in the infancy of digital photography. Our ability to control lens behaviour is still so finite. \* [Photo software essentials](http://www.tongfamily.com/focus_magic_dxo.php). Must get all of these. Oh and should [try this](http://www.bobsplanet.com/serendipity/archives/147-New-Windows-Explorer-Photo-Metadata-Software.html) tho I am largely moving to the Mac for things photographic. \* And must try out [Picnik](http://www.picnik.com/) \* Not sure I want [this bag](http://www.crunchgear.com/2007/12/13/cg-holiday-2007-recommendation-crumplers-brazillion-dollar-home/) but I do like Crumpler bags
