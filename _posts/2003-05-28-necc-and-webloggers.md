Per [Weblogg-ed Vol.2: Using Weblogs in Education](http://www.weblogg-ed.com/2003/05/28#a709 "Weblogg-ed Vol.2: Using Weblogs in Education"), looks like there will be some education/blog activity at the NECC conference here in Seattle. I think this would be fun to visit, I may show up just to see what people are talking about.
