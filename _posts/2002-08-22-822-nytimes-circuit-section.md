**8/22 NY Times Circuit section**. Lots of good stuff in [here](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/technology/circuits/index.html) today. [Googlemail](http://www.capeclear.com/). Jaguar review -- after 14 years away, I may have to buy a Mac. Single number services -- [Kall8](http://www.kall8.com), [Simulring](http://www.simulring.com), [Linxcom](http://www.linxcom.com) \-- i need to get one of these someday.
