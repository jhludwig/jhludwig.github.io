[Calacanis: Apple to release networked HDTVs - Nate Lanxon, MP3 & Digital Music Editor - Technology Blog at CNET.co.uk](http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/natelanxon/0,139102300,49299275,00.htm). -- this would be good. The current state of the world where you have to buy some separate box and whack it into your media center to get IP-delivered content is just not going to succeed, the mainstream isn't going to go thru this brain damage. The IP receiver has to be built into the TV or the media receiver or some other piece that people understand and know they need.
