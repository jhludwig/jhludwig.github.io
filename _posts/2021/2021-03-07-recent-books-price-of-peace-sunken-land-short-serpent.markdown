- [The Price of Peace](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49644992-the-price-of-peace) by Zachary Carter. I never realized what a fascinating, rich life Keynes led. And I never understand the moral basis for Keynes’ views (at least as expressed in this book), and how far the US strayed from Keynes’ views. Makes me want to read more.
- [The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49201192) by M. John Harrison. I gave up on this one, it was vague to start and heading towards more vagueness.
- [The Voyage of the Short Serpent](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2458336.The_Voyage_of_the_Short_Serpent) by Bernard du Boucheron. Humans are terrible to each other and self-righteous humans can be some of the worst.
