- [The Quiet Boy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55934731-the-quiet-boy) by Ben H. Winters. A legal thriller but with some supernatural twists, engaging and a little strange.
- [The Shadow of the Wind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1232.The_Shadow_of_the_Wind) by Carlos Ruiz Zafón. My great friend Tim has recommended this book heartily, and Tim is the most dedicated reader I know. This is a very good tale, at times it drags a little, but ties together very very nicely. Love, betrayal, jealousy, murder, atonement -- it has it all.
- [The Disappearing Act](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58053554-the-disappearing-act) by Catherine Steadman. Not my favorite thriller. The main character continually makes dumb choices, no one would really behave this way.
- [The Next 500 Years](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57799228-the-next-500-years) by Christoper E. Mason. An exploration of how humans can/should genetically modify themselves to improve our lives and to spread the race to the planets and stars. Interesting science, somewhat insane moral philosophy -- the author makes the case that we must spread humanity as far as we can, and this imperative takes precedence over any personal choice. Taken to the extreme this is nuts and dangerous.
- [The Kingdom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34350046-the-kingdom) by Emmanuel Carrère. A detailed look at the 50 years after Jesus's death and how the religion developed. A lot of conjecture but interesting to think about the fits and starts of the process. Also a lot of personal exploration by the author about how his own religiosity waxed and waned. Interesting intertwining of stories.
