- [The Last Flight](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51197260-the-last-flight) by Julie Clark. A great tale of women trying to escape from abusive situations. On the edge of my seat. Well crafted.
- [Shape](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56430139-shape) by Jordan Ellenberg. I should love this book but it was just ok. A tricky book to write as the audience is bimodal at least. I found it tedious at times.
- [Project Hail Mary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary) by Andy Weir. Admittedly this is a very similar story to The Martian but with two main characters, but still a lot of fun.
- [The Library at Mount Char](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26892110-the-library-at-mount-char) by Scott Hawkins. One strange-ass story, really pulled me in. I am not sure I want a heavy diet of this kind of story but one was good.
