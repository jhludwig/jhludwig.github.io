- [The End of Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52767659-the-end-of-everything) by Katie Mack. In the midst of all our current political and social turmoil, you can read this book and either a) have even more to worry about, because the Universe is going to end and it could be tomorrow, or b) have even less to worry about because the Universe is going to end and nothing we do now matters.
- [The 99% Invisible City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50416393-the-99-invisible-city) by Roman Mars, Kurt Kohlstedt. Shines a light on all those little design and structure features that most of us ignore every day. A good book to read a little bit out of every day.
- [Born Standing Up](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/773858.Born_Standing_Up) by Steve Martin. Very introspective look at his career and how it developed. Great insights about being intentional and thoughtful about your life.
