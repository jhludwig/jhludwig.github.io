- [The Adventure Zone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35684941-here-there-be-gerblins?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=RbmSSG0AYH&rank=1) by the McElroy family, Carey Pietsch illustrator. Gets great reviews but pretty thin gruel for me. I probably would have thought it hilarious when I was young. From a well regarded podcast tho I never listen to podcasts.
- [Agent Sonya](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578861-agent-sonya?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=akE6Ngdpde&rank=1) by Ben Macintyre. Good telling of the story of a female Soviet spy during WWII and the Cold War. Amazingly gutsy spy, hard to imagine living this kind of double life.

And those are the last of my 2020 reads.
