- [Hidden Valley Road](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49679332-hidden-valley-road) by Robert Kolker. Quite the story of a family plagued by schizophrenia, their attempts to survive, and the slow growth in understanding schizophrenia.
- [A Children's Bible](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53122391-a-children-s-bible) by Lydia Millet. A retelling of the apocalypse, or a forecast of how climate change will impact us and the generations after us.
- [Snow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53988426-snow) by John Banville. Solid English countryside mystery, tho in this case the Irish countryside. I won't remember much of it but it was entertaining.
