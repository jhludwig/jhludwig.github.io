- [Malevolent Republic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51012438-malevolent-republic) by K. S. Komireddi. A virulent criticism of current Indian politics. I don't know enough about India to really know how to think about this topic. I need to read and learn more.
- [Exo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26532931-exo) by Fonda Lee. YA novel about a young soldier caught between the sides warring over the future of Earth. Entertaining but not enough to stick with the series.
- [Perdido Street Station](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19888971-perdido-street-station) by China Mieville. I didn't read this when it first came out because it was so trendy. But quite a good read, impressive ability to visualize and describe a very alien far future/fantasy world. A little long but good.
- [Madi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54304992-madi) by Duncan Jones and Alex Di Campi. My quarterly dip into graphic novels, this was just eh. I appreciate the attempt to include a lot of different artists, but it made it hard for me to connect to characters and story.
- [Everything: A Book of Aphorisms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25584210-everything) by Aaron Haspel. A gem on every page, the perfect bathroom book.
