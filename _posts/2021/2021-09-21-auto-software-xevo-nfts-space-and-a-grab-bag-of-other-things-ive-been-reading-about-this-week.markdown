## Auto Software

[Tesla beats Mustang thanks to charging network](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-ev-electric-car-ford-mach-e-road-trip-charging-problems-2021-9) — the traditional car OEMs really don't seem to understand how big a software hole they are in.  It is not just autonomy or entertainment systems, but the entire end-to-end lifecycle of the car -- presales website, configurator, post-sale site and services, charging network software, mobile app, in-car software, etc.   It is all driven by software and Tesla is ahead on all of it.

I am glad to see Xevo alum end up in so many great places — Amperity, Docusign, Curbside, Axon, Afresh, Clearscale, Discovery, Dignifi, Indeed, Amazon, News Break, Crowdstrike, Stoke Space Tech, Slalom, Google, Oracle, and more I probably missed.   Good luck to you all!

## **NFT Redux**

[Some of this art is beautiful and entrancing](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/jen-stark-shawna-x-ix-shells-foundation-nft-art-digital-030921), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/) seems like a good exchange to find NFT art.  A lot of it is generative content, created by neural nets, using a lot of shaders.  It can create very engaging content.  I love dorking around with shaders and neural nets as much as anyone, and i have no skill/practice in creating art, so I really admire this work, but I can't wrap my head around paying $5k-30K for a rendered video capture of one of these.  Maybe I would pay that much for source code access.  

Who is paying these prices (and more) for generative content (much of which has much less artistic content than the ones I prefer)?  [Yet another argument that this is all just unfounded speculation](https://seths.blog/2021/09/speculation-is-the-new-luxury-good/).

It is easy to discount all this NFT and crypto stuff as speculation.  [But the quality of talent diving into it](https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1439355994371289090?s=20) is significant.  

## **Space**

What could go wrong?  [NASA is going to slam a spacecraft into an asteroid](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/09/1035166/dart-nasa-spacecraft-asteroid-protection-dimorphos/?truid=&utm_source=the_download&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&utm_term=&utm_content=09-10-2021&mc_cid=ea98f7619c&mc_eid=243dc73da2).

[Interesting thread from Tren Griffin](https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/1436709666864517124?s=21) on size of the space economy.  If I was young and starting my career again, this would be very exciting.

## **Random**

[“We are basically a country of contrarian assholes, and when our leaders tell us to do one thing we tend to respond by doing the exact opposite.”](https://thewhyaxis.substack.com/p/one-chart-that-explains-the-gops)

[Booker Prize shortlist](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-58558396).  I find a lot of Booker nominees to be unreadable but probably some gold in here somewhere

[Hand drawn illustration library](https://openpeeps.com/), free for commercial and personal use.

[How to open google docs in different google accounts](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1438878502451879939?s=21) -- i had no idea docs.new/1 or docs.new/2 would work

The [three minute song](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/is-the-three-minute-song-bad-for) may not be the best.

No links, gosh there is a lot of contrary advice on the web about how to smoke brisket.  My first attempt earned a “C” at best.

[QED venture investment lessons](https://twitter.com/fintechjunkie/status/1437785630507929603?s=21).  I love most of these.
