In the comments on [my post about college football conference strength](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001065.html "a little ludwig goes a long way: Which conferences are the best in college football this year?"), Brian takes issue with a simple win/loss ranking, and he makes some good points. Rich Tellshow has done some [further analysis on strength of schedules](http://www.geocities.com/rtell/teams/conf.html) which is worth looking at -- points to the Pac10 and Big10 as the strongest conferences so far this year.
