Software I've tried recently:

\* [GamesKnoppix](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/12/28/GamesKnoppix.html). Yawn. Buggy and mostly in german. Games aren't anything to write home about. \* [Acrobat Reader 7.0](http://www.adobe.com). Recommended. Loads much faster than prior versions. \* [MT 3.14](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/12/movable_type_3.shtml). I don't really notice much but it was an easy upgrade. \* [Tag&Rename 3.2Beta](http://www.softpointer.com/tr.htm). Yawn. Complicated and wasn't very good at figuring out tags for my mystery tracks (mostly classical cds or low volume compilations) \* [A9 toolbar for firefox](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/internet/2004/12/16/a9_for_firefox.html). Works fine but I just can't get in the a9 mood. \* [MS antispyware beta](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/microsoft_antis.html). Recommended -- found a couple problems on my machine that others hadn't, and has free signature updates. \* [Tweaks to speed up firefox](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=708). Despite the caveats, they worked for me. \* [Spell check for firefox](http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20041209_spell_check_for_firefox.phtml). I'm usually ok on spelling but a nice tool to have. \* [True Launch Bar](http://www.truelaunchbar.com/download.html). Nice that it is a transparent upgrade to the quicklaunch bar. But a little overpowering.

Software I'd like to try:

\* [Great smallware list](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/01/great_smallware.html). I love these little utilities. \* [46 best freeware utilities](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2004/12/46_bestever_fre.html). Another good list. \* [Sokkit](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/01/04/Sokkit.html) \-- solves a need for me, easy install/config of AMP on windows.

Intriguing readings on software:

\* [Public ontologies](http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2004/12/public_ontologi.html). I don't think end users will ever put keywords/classifications on all their output -- but I do think a shared public ontology that can advise free text searching is pretty useful. When I search for "theatrical lighting control", i'd love it if the search engines could benefit from the collective wisdom of the net and realize that "dmx" and "dmx-512" might be useful synonyms for my search, for instance. \* [Bayesian tutorial and code](http://due-diligence.typepad.com/blog/2004/12/great_probabili.html). Cool. \* [p2p in 15 lines of code](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000738.html). Unstoppable. \* One man's advice on [how to better secure your system](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/12/safe_personal_c.html).
