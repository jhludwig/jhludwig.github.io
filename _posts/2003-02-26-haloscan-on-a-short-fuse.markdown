**Haloscan on a short fuse**. [Haloscan](http://www.haloscan.com), the external commenting service I use, seems to be down more than up, and it kills page load performance when it is unavailable. I am giving them this week to fix it before I give up. May be what drives me to moveable type finally, I've been too lazy to move to it, but I hate it when my pages load slowly.
