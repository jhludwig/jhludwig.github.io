I needed some escapism.

- [Vanishing Games](http://www.amazon.com/Vanishing-Games-novel-Roger-Hobbs/dp/0385352646) by Roger Hobbs. Pirates, Macau, Diamonds, Counterfeiting, high bodycount. Fun but not distinctive.[![planetfall](images/planetfall.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/02/recent-books-vanishing-games-hades-forty-thieves-planetfall/planetfall/)
- [Hades](http://www.amazon.com/Hades-Archer-Bennett-Thriller-Candice-ebook/dp/B00Q325UCM) by Candice Fox. Cops with dark pasts taking the law into their own hands. Also a high body count.
- [Forty Thieves](http://www.amazon.com/Forty-Thieves-Thomas-Perry/dp/0802124526) by Thomas Perry. Now this was more fun, a husband/wife PI team run into a husband/wife assassin team, both trying to resolve a cold case. Bullets fly.
- [Planetfall](http://www.amazon.com/Planetfall-Emma-Newman/dp/0425282392) by Emma Newman. Ok this started out slow, a group of colonists on a new planet, but it went very strange, with a strange alien experience, and twisted humans.
