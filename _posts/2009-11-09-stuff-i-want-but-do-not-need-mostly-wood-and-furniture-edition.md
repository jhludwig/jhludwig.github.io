- [Kinetic wood sculptures](http://www.woodthatworks.com/). No idea what I'd do with but admire the artist (via [Grimvisions](http://www.grimvisions.com/))
- [Secret Knock Detecting Doorlock](http://grathio.com/2009/11/secret-knock-detecting-door-lock.html). No sillier than any other door unlocking scheme we use.
- [Bendywood](http://transmaterial.net/index.php/2009/10/28/bendywood/). The perfect building material. For Gumby.
- [Ceramic Speakers.](http://design-milk.com/ceramic-speakers-from-joey-roth/)
- [Dinner set Lamp](http://www.kimhayoon.com/hy_works_l01.html). OK this one I really secretly want.
- [Revomaze](http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/games/c247/). Because life is too simple and easy to manage.
- [Bendit Bookends](http://design-milk.com/bendit-bookends/). Tho my Kindle is decimating my future bookshelf needs.
- [Snowing Photo Frame](http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2009/09/snowing_photo_frame.html). Where's the "Make Me Look Thinner Photo Frame", that thing would sell a bundle
- [Wood shavings table](http://design-milk.com/shavings-by-yoav-avinoam/). Awesome looking.
