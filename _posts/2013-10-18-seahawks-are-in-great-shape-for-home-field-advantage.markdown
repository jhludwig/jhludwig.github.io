In the "counting chickens way before they've hatched department", look at the remaining schedule for the Seahawks, Niners, and Saints:

- Seahawks remaining opponents are 20-32 in aggregate. Niners: 24-34. Saints: 26-31. Advantage: Seahawks.
- Seahawks remaining opponents average a little worse than 3rd place in their divisions. Niners and Saints, about midway between 2nd and 3rd. Advantage: Seahawks.
- Seahawks have 4 remaining away games. Niners 6, Saints 5. Advantage: Seahawks.
- Seahawks away games are easier -- the opponents have an average 2-4 record. Niners: 2-4, Saints: 3-3. Advantage or Push: Seahawks

The Seahawks are benefitting in particular from the Giants and Vikings cratering this year. Has left them with a great opportunity to secure home field advantage throughout the playoffs, which of course for Seattle is a substantial advantage.

Enjoy your NFL weekend!
