**From Lockergnome**. [OneClickPlay](http://www.czech-ware.net/popelka/main.asp?lang=en&page=ocp&lng=en) looks like a great utility to use with winamp -- creating playlists is a major pain. It would be cool if this would create play lists based on search criteria across all my media "all songs by Prince, Rick James, or of type FUNK".

This is interesting -- [Q315237 - High Rate of Collisions on 100-MB Networks](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q315237).

And a good source of desktop [wallpaper](http://art.softshape.com/).
