**Mechanical Engineering**. A compendium of the ways to [translate rotational motion into linear motion](http://www.flying-pig.co.uk/Pages/mechindex.htm). Super helpful for Halloween. I need the similar compendium now for converting motion in one direction into motion in another direction, and multiplication of motion.
