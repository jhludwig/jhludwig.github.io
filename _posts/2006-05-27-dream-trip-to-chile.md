Haven't had much opportunity to travel in the last year but hopefully will get the chance to do so. In the meantime there are some trips I am dying to take and I might as well collect all the links so I can quickly organize when I get the chance.

I've been dying to go to Chile for many years now. The natural beauty really calls to me. The highlight of my trip will be an [Earth River expedition in Patagonia](http://www.earthriver.com/expeditions.asp?expedition=futaleufu&ss=3&header=3). This pretty much pins the trip to the Chilean summer months -- December thru March.

Certainly I'll want to spend time before or after the river in and around Santiago -- some online guides:

And then probably will want to get out of Santiago and see one other part of the country...not sure where...maybe should stay in Lake District a while at end of rafting trip tho maybe I'd be all watered out at that point? Or maybe Valparaiso and Vina del Mar in central Chile -- [here is one guy's idea of an itinerary](http://gosouthamerica.about.com/cs/southamerica/a/ChiDrmTripCntr.htm). Easter Island would be a fascinating choice too but that just doesn't feel to me like really getting to know Chile. Maybe the wine district -- stay at [Termas Jahuel](http://www.jahuel.cl/).
