- [The Wrong Stars](https://www.amazon.com/Wrong-Stars-Axiom-Tim-Pratt-ebook/dp/B06X8YCP8P) by Tim Pratt.  Space opera -- pirates, aliens, wormholes, etc.  Fun but not that memorable.
- [Beneath a Scarlet Sky](https://www.amazon.com/Beneath-Scarlet-Sky-Mark-Sullivan-ebook/dp/B01L1CEZ6K) by Mark Sullivan.  World War II escapades of a young Italian spy. Based on a true story, very engaging.
- [The Wolves of Winter](https://www.amazon.com/Wolves-Winter-Novel-Tyrell-Johnson-ebook/dp/B01M3X6D2X) by Tyrell Johnson.  Post-apocalyptic tale of survivors in the Yukon.  Ok but pretty well-trod ground.
