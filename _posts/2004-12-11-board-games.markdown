From [this slashdot entry](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/07/1958257&from=rss), lots of great board game sites:

\* [The Morning News game guide](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/opinions/the_2004_good_gift_games_guide.php) \* [Funagain Games](http://www.funagain.com/control/main) for all your buying \* [Boardgamegeek](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/) for enthusiasts \* [SeattleSpiel](http://www.seattlespiel.com/) for Seattle board gamers

It is kind of a holiday tradition of ours to spend a few nights playing some board games...lots of good ideas for this year in the above links.
