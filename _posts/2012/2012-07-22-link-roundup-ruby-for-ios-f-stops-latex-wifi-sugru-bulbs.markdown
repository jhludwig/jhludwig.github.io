[![](images/6186929069_f72cf92699_m.jpg "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anthonystoro/")](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/6186929069_f72cf92699_m.jpg)\* "Ruby for iOS development":http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/05/exclusive-building-ruby-ios-applications-with-rubymotion.ars. Fascinating stuff. Moving beyond ObjectiveC seems like a good thing. $200 seems a bit steep. \* "Simple explanation of F stop":http://www.petapixel.com/2012/04/02/a-simple-explanation-of-f-stop-numbers/. Useful. But beware, "simple" == 15 minutes, because the topic just isn't that simple. \* "Convert handwriting to LaTeX":http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/07/20/converting-hand-drawn-equations-to-latex-and-mathml/. Kind of awesome. Tho I tend to learn the easy keyboard equivalents for LaTeX pretty fast, but still this is awesome \* Rich has a bunch on "Wifi channel selection":http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2011/11/wifi-channels-which-are-the-best/, I am probably massively suboptimal. \* "Sugru self setting rubber":http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/07/12/back-in-stock-sugru-multicolor-pack-self-setting-rubber/. Awesome stuff. \* What are you going to do with all your obsolete incandescent bulbs? I bet it won't be as cool as the "Bulb Box":http://www.alhamaddesign.com/collection1.html#8
