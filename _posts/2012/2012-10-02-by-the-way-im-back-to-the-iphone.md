After 6 months or so with the "Nokia Lumia":http://theludwigs.com/2012/04/switching-to-the-nokia-lumia-900-for-a-while/, I'm back to the iPhone -- the iPhone 5. The Lumia was nice looking hardware, but Nokia and MSFT's orphaning of the handset annoyed me, and the device was pretty underpowered. The iPhone feels marvelously responsive in contrast. I have to say the IOS software is still pretty boring, still a sea of icons. But it is good to be back to a phone with a rich marketplace of apps.
