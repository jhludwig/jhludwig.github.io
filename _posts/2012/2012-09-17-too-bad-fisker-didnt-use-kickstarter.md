[![](images/WP_000124.jpg "WP_000124")](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/WP_000124.jpg)So a longish time ago I got all excited about the "Fisker Karma":http://onward.fiskerautomotive.com/en-us/karma/overview/ and put a $1000 deposit down.

Then the car was super late. And the interior was very tight. And the performance wasn't that outstanding. And I loved my Audi. And I couldn't justify the expense.

To my surprise they called me last month and offered me my deposit back, I figured that money was long gone.
