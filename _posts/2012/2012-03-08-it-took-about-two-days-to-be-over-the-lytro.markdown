OK so it is fun to have one and I am glad I bought it. I will get some value out of it. But ... the resolution of the pictures is poor, and the scenarios for the benefits provided are limited. The on-camera screen is very small and it is super hard to review pictures on the device. The effective shutter speed and ISO speed don't seem that great either. And grr, why don't people provide straps to secure lens caps? And it is so out of the flow of my normal photo processing, it doesn't integrate with either my iPhone flow or my DSLR flow easily. It is a great idea and I suspect it finds its way into most cameras eventually.
