"MGoBlog":http://mgoblog.com/content/bcs-doubts-college-football-stadium-can-host-college-football-game rips apart the rationalization from BCS leaders about hosting of college football playoff games.

The proposal to host these games at schools was awesome and would have created some terrific games with terrific atmospheres, college football is all about atmosphere. Moving to neutral sites blows. The BCS really thinks that a school like UM in a smaller city can't handle the logistics of a playoff game? Have they been to a Michigan football weekend with a major opponent like OSU or ND?

The BCS may have valid reasons to favor neutral sites (bowl sponsors plyIng them with $), but these are not those reasons.
