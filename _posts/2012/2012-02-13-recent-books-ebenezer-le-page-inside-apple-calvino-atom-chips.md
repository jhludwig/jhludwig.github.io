\* "The Book of Ebenezer Le Page":amazon by G. B. Edwards. Well this really grew on me. The life tale of a Guernsey resident over most of the 20th century, it was rough sledding at first, but I was in love with Ebenezer by the end. He knows every person and every scandal on the island, many of which touch his life. Great tale. \* "Inside Apple":amazon by Adam Lashinsky. Much more interesting than the Jobs biography, gives some insight into the operations of Apple and speculation about how it might fare with the loss of Jobs. Really useful operational insights for any company. \* "If On A Winter's Night A Traveler":amazon by Italo Calvino. A novel that explores the nature of reading and the nature of books via a very unusual structure. I didn't really enjoy the fabulist elements, not my taste, but a unique structure. \* "Atom Chips":amazon, edited by Jakob Reichel and Vladen Vuletic. After the navel-gazing of the Calvino piece, I needed something much more definite. This is a pretty dense graduate-level text on chip-level designs to manipulate individual atoms. I am wading thru it, not a quick read.
