Hey, Ohio State had a bye, I had to watch something. 3 observations after watching "the show":http://www.bravotv.com/start-ups-silicon-valley:

\* I am now embarrassed to say I work in the tech industry. \* Apparently there are just as many venal, shallow people in the tech industry as there are in Orange County, the Jersey Shore, or any other reality show setting \* If someone ever shows up with a camera and says they want to put you on a reality show, why would you ever do anything besides run away? They are not there to burnish your image.
