\* The "Advanced Setup page at elinux":http://elinux.org/RPi\_Advanced\_Setup has great tips on how to go headless, including key-based ssh and zeroconf setup, and basic SD card setup. \* This "guide at linuxnews":http://linux-news.org/index.php/2012/06/02/raspberry-pi-emulation/ is a good guide for getting an RPI emulator working on Ubuntu, I followed it, changing only to the latest raspbian linux distro image, and it worked fine. But it has no net access so more to do. \* This "arm emulation guide":http://franciscobenitezleon.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/installing-debian-lenny-on-virtualized-arm-arch-with-qemu-on-ubuntu-karmic-koala/ adn "this one":http://www.cnx-software.com/2011/02/10/emulate-an-arm-plaform-with-qemu-on-ubuntu-10-10/ have a little more detail on how to generate and modify the ondisk image, I might want to mix these in with the previous guide. As i understand these, there are 3 images to play around with -- the in-memory kernel boot image, the initial ramdisk image (initrd), and an initial filesystem image. \* "AQEMU":http://aqemu.sourceforge.net/ looks like a useful tool for creating and managing a network connection and other qemu setup attributes \* Some good guidance on "arm toolchains":http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3812. Some people like the "sourcery toolchain":http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/request?id=478dff82-62bc-44b2-afe2-4684d83b19b9&downloadlite=scblite2012&fmpath=/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/form. And some more "toolchain info":https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded
