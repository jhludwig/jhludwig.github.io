What a great article at @farnamstreet -- "An obsession with failure":http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/03/an-obsession-with-failure/. People that worry about their failures, who take responsibility for them, who consider what else they might have done, tend to be the strongest performers over time. I've always felt like my best interview question for people has always been "What's your greatest failure?". The answer usually tells me a lot about the person's character.
