...the harddisk was full and that caused all kinds of hell to break loose.

But really it was a sign -- "Macbook Pro with Retina Display":http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/ -- ordered.

J is laughing at me -- $200 for the extra 8G of ram, so $400 imputed price for 16G, and J just bought 16G for $80. I am a lemming.
