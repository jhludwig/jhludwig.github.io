Relating to [my post about effective business communication](http://theludwigs.com/2012/02/you-might-want-to-develop-a-weapon-besides-the-bazooka/) the other day, here's a "great post on being right vs. being effective.":http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/02/do-you-want-to-be-right-or-do-you-want-to-be-effective/. Of course it is best to be effective AND be right -- being wrong and effective leads to epic disasters.

Reminds me of the classic 4 quadrant chart of ambition vs competence. Being competent is good, but you need to have a dollop of ambition. And you have to get the ambitious and incompetent people out of your org as quickly as possible.
