Sigh. I've downloaded the install 3 times, generated a new license key (I hope they don't run out), and twice tried to do a clean install off a USB key and once off a burned DVD. Every time install fails partway thru with a error 0x8007025D and some text about being unable to write files. I'm doing an install to a new disk with 1.3TB of free space, and the drive seems to work fine under win7. I don't want to do an upgrade install. Searching around the Internet doesn't seem to bring any relief, some people have encountered similar issues when installing in a VM but I am not doing that.

On the plus side my Lytro arrived so I will go play with that.

UPDATE: some nice MSFT folks have been helping me thru the problems and I have a working win8 install now. Will do a separate post on that, but just want to thank the MSFT folks for working with me.
