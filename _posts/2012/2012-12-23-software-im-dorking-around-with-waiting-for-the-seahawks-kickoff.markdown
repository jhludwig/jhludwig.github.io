\* Great list of tools from Patrick Rhone at "MinimalMac":http://minimalmac.com/post/38230590462/some-tools-that-made-my-computing-life-better-in-2012. Installed doublepane right away. \* "Infoxicate":infoxicate.com seems like it could be IFTTT only really useful. Tho seems to be just a concept so far. \* Powerpoint is so dull. I love "Haiku Deck":http://www.haikudeck.com. And "Timeline":http://www.beedocs.com seems interesting. Both seem to really highlight the story and emotions of a story, unlike powerpoint which creates seas of dot points. \* I want an "Eve Alpha":http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ciseco/eve-alpha-raspberry-pi-wireless-development-hardwa. Not sure why. \* I should have followed @randfish's guidance and made some "minted photo calendars":http://www.minted.com/photo-calendars this year. \* If someone starts challenging your database knowledge, whip "this chart":http://gigaom.com/cloud/confused-by-the-glut-of-new-databases-heres-a-map-for-you/ out. And hit them with it. \* "Tinybasic for raspberrypi":http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2277. Historically this was an important inflection point.
