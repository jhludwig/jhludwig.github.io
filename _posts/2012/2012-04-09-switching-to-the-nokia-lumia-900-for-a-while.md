[![](images/7048801715_565030b4df_q.jpg "7048801715_565030b4df_q")](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/7048801715_565030b4df_q.jpg)I've decided to move away from the iPhone for a while, I just got the new Nokia Lumia 900 and am filling it up with apps right now.

Why? Well, [iOS is starting to feeling stale](http://theludwigs.com/2012/03/yes-the-retina-display-ipad-is-beautiful-but-the-software-is-starting-to-feel-dated/) -- I have an unending grid of apps, there have to be other ways to organize tasks and data. iOS has poor integration across apps, very limited integration between apps and the shell, little data sharing between apps, etc.

And only exposing myself to iOS makes my brain stale -- I start to let myself be constrained by the iOS grid and app model. I need to experience are other ways to skin the cat, and Windows Phone is trying some different things which are worth understanding -- the facebook integration, pinning of content to the shell, etc.

Switching to Windows Phone also appeals to the contrarian in me. How cool can it be to have an iPhone if everybody has one?

So off I go. Hanselman has a "good list of essential apps":hnsl.mn/wyuZhY. And I've installed the WordPress, ESPN, and Starbucks apps. It is interesting that I can bill apps to either ATT or to a credit card on file with my Zune app -- I wonder what the rev split is between carrier and MSFT and app developer for these two different models.

One very positive initial reaction -- no stupid pair of crappy earbuds in the box. I've thrown so many of the useless Apple ones away.
