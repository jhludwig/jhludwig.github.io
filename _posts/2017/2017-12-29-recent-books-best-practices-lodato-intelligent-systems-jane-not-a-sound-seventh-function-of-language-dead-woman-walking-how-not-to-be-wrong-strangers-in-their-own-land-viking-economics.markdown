- [The Journal of Best Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Journal-Best-Practices-Marriage-Asperger-ebook/dp/B004T4KRJM) by David Finch.  Engaging tale of a man who set out methodically to improve his relationships.  Good counsel for all of us.
- [Edgar & Lucy](https://www.amazon.com/Edgar-Lucy-Novel-Victor-Lodato-ebook/dp/B01KFWOL5W) by Victor Lodato.  Intriguing and I seemed to enjoy, but somehow just never finished.  I am not sure why.  I guess I am not really in a fantasy mood.
- [Intelligent Systems for Engineers and Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Systems-Engineers-Scientists-Third-ebook/dp/B00BC926LE) by Adrian Hopgood.  Kind of dated at this point.[![](images/81nBM5PAhZL-200x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2017/12/recent-books-best-practices-lodato-intelligent-systems-jane-not-a-sound-seventh-function-of-language-dead-woman-walking-how-not-to-be-wrong-strangers-in-their-own-land-viking-economics/81nbm5pahzl/)
- [Jane, Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/Jane-Unlimited-Kristin-Cashore-ebook/dp/B01MY28M5P) by Kristin Cashore.  Good reviews but ugh, choppy and poorly developed.
- [Not A Sound](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Sound-Thriller-Heather-Gudenkauf-ebook/dp/B01M8M9IW1) by Heather Gudenkauf.  Solid thriller -- a deaf woman stumbles into a mystery, and increasingly learns that those closest to her may be involved.
- [The Seventh Function of Language](https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Function-Language-Novel-ebook/dp/B01NARGQEU) by Laurent Binet.  Great book, man did this make me feel uneducated -- the art, literature, and culture references flew by me, but well written.
- [Dead Woman Walking](https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Woman-Walking-Sharon-Bolton-ebook/dp/B06VV8ZRWP) by Sharon Bolton.  Nice thriller set in Scottish border lands with some excellent twists.
- [How Not To Be Wrong](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical-ebook/dp/B00G3L6JQ4) by Jordan Ellenberg.  Great discussion of practical math and statistics and how they impact our everyday life.  Really good.
- [Strangers In Their Own Land](https://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Their-Own-Land-Mourning-ebook/dp/B01EEQ9BSW) by Arlie Russell Hochschild.  Another "how does the conservative right think" book.  Useful to try to build empathy.  Let's hope that the conservative right are reading the equivalent books.
- [Viking Economics](https://www.amazon.com/Viking-Economics-How-Scandinavians-Right-ebook/dp/B017QLQ8A6) by George Lakey.  A bit gushing, but still a solid read about Nordic economies and values, and what we can learn from them.  A core point that resonated with me -- the Nordic countries have embraced "investing in our people" as a core principle, and a lot of policy decisions stem from that.  This does not seem like a bad idea.
