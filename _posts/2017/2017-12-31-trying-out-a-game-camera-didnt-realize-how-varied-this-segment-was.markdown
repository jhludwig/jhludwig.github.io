We don't hunt but we like to observe the critters around us.  Trying out the [Bushnell Aggressor](http://bushnell.com/wildlife/trail-cameras/trophy-cam/trophy-cam-hd-aggressor-wireless) -- no idea if it is the best, but got decent reviews, and we wanted the cellular capability.[![](images/ff4dbe6b-dcc1-4623-baf5-13a948f0ddd8-300x225.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2017/12/trying-out-a-game-camera-didnt-realize-how-varied-this-segment-was/ff4dbe6b-dcc1-4623-baf5-13a948f0ddd8/)

Bushnell offers its own portal at [wirelesstrophycam.com](http://www.wirelesstrophycam.com) and also includes a trial offer for [Deerlab](http://deerlab.com/bushnell) which seems to have a bunch more features.  The device also comes with a 30 day wireless trial plan and notifies via text or email of new captures, and apparently you can extend the data plan without a contract which is nice..  It can be configured to capture video or pictures as desired.  It uses an impressive 12 AA batteries but apparently can also be hooked up to a solar panel.

The first critter it spotted is not surprising or particularly alarming!  I will deploy it in a location more likely to see deer, otter, mink, etc in the future.
