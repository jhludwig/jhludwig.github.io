- [The March of Folly](https://www.amazon.com/March-Folly-Troy-Vietnam-ebook/dp/B00589AYWW) by Barbara Tuchman[![](images/Satin-Bower-Bird-Nest-300x199.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2017/04/recent-books-march-of-folly-hawley-haigh-lee-birds/satin-bower-bird-nest/). Not a new book but pretty timeless lessons. Our country is certainly making missteps yet again in the Middle East.
- [Before the Fall](https://www.amazon.com/Before-Fall-Noah-Hawley-ebook/dp/B0151YQUTE) by Noah Hawley. Excellent mystery about the crash of a private plane, in which every passenger and crew member has secrets that may have been in play.
- [Heat and Light](https://www.amazon.com/Heat-Light-Novel-Jennifer-Haigh-ebook/dp/B00S569ME6) by Jennifer Haigh. A failing small town and the people in it, struggling with the arrival of fracking. I didn't love it but seems timely.
- [High Dive](https://www.amazon.com/High-Dive-novel-Jonathan-Lee-ebook/dp/B00ZNE44VY) by Jonathan Lee. A fictionalization of the events around a 1984 bombing in Brighton England. Engaging but not amazing.
- [The Genius of Birds](https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Birds-Jennifer-Ackerman-ebook/dp/B0125VU7LI) by Jennifer Ackerman. Great studies of birds and their behaviors. Go look up images of the bowers created by bowerbirds, truly confounding.
