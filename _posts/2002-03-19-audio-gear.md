**Audio Gear** I am thinking about getting a [panasonic sy-pa100](http://www.prodcat.panasonic.com/shop/templates/square_template.asp?ModelId=13185&show_all=false&product_exists=True&active=1&ModelNo=SY-PA100) personal pa system. Replaces about 3 pieces of gear I currently use to practice guitar with -- practice amp, drum machine, cd player. it is a little dorky looking but i think it could be cool. oh yeah it replaces a 4th piece of gear, my mixer.
