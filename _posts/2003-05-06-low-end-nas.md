Hey Gary this looks like it might be easier to set up than your Martian Netdrive -- [XiMeta Unveils First Network Direct Attached Storage Device - Technology - Mobilemag.com](http://www.mobilemag.com/content/100/102/C1675/ "XiMeta Unveils First Network Direct Attached Storage Device - Technology - Mobilemag.com"). Nothing really that new to this device, just a low end NAS (I think). I wonder what code base they use for their SMB server, I have noticed my cheapo SNAP NAS has some real perf bottlenecks.
