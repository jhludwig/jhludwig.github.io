Cleaning up the bookshelves while we are shut in...

- [Planet of Adventure](https://www.amazon.com/Planet-Adventure-Chasch-Servants-Dirdir/dp/0312854889) by Jack Vance. If you like Burrough's Mars books, then you will like this. I read the Burroughs books when I was very young, and they have not held up well, but I loved them as a kid. And I kind of love this tho again has not aged well.
- [Introduction to Econometrics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201715953) by James H. Stock, Mark W. Watson. On my shelves for 16 years, not sure why. An average intro to regression analysis.
- [A History of the World in 100 Objects](https://www.amazon.com/History-World-100-Objects-ebook/dp/B0052RCX0G/) by Neil MacGregor. Much better than I anticipated, a very readable and visual walk thru the entire span of human history.
