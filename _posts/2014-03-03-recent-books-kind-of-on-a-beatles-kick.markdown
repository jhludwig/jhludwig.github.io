- [Tune In](http://www.amazon.com/Beatles-All-These-Years-Tune-ebook/dp/B00CNQ9P6E/) by Mark Lewisohn. Fascinating telling of the Beatles' early years. Massive detail. Uplifting in many many ways, the group overcame great odds, while staying true to themselves. But never let your kids catch you admiring this book, the young Beatles were not exactly role models.
- [All The Songs](http://www.amazon.com/All-The-Songs-Beatles-Release/dp/1579129528/) by Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin. Exhaustive notes on the writing and recording of every Beatles' song, which provides an interesting window onto the arc of the group.
