for an extended stay -- need a kitchen in particular. [Woodfin Suite Hotel, a premier all-suite hotel in Dublin, Ohio](http://www.woodfinsuitehotels.com/dublin/ "Woodfin Suite Hotel, a premier all-suite hotel in Dublin, Ohio") looks like a reasonable choice. Not that far from the [Whole Foods in Columbus](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/StoreLocations.html?state=Ohio&city=Columbus&searchBtn=Search) which is a plus.
