Catching up with all of Martin's postings:

\* [Responding to the negative energy balance FUD around biodiesel](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/07/one_mans_respon.html) -- good stuff \* [Seattle leading way to embrace Kyoto](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/seattle_leading.html) -- great news. I think we're way behind in fully embracing eco-friendly industrial policies in this country. Put it this way -- if you want to defend your economy and markets from high growth, emerging producers -- raising the eco-bar way high is probably a good thing to do. Emerging producers may be able to produce basic high volume goods cheaply, but it will take them a while to catch up with highly-engineered green goods and services. \* [Martin discovers process modelling software](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/chemical_proces.html) -- I have no real use for these tools but they are incredibly fun to play with. \* [Current supply and demand numbers](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/some_fun_with_o.html) -- fuel prices are only going one way. \* [From Bits to Barrels](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/08/from_bits_to_ba.html) -- Martin's contribution to SNS, journaling his transformation into the John D. Rockefeller of the next century :). Hey martin, go read "Titan".
