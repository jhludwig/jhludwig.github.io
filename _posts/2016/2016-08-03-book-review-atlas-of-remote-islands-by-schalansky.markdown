[Atlas of Remote Islands](https://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Remote-Islands-Judith-Schalansky/dp/014311820X) [![deception-island](images/deception-island-293x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/book-review-atlas-of-remote-islands-by-schalansky/deception-island/)by Judith Schalansky. 50 islands you will probably never visit, and a little bit of their story. Not your regular atlas, each entry is a little historical vignette about the island -- shipwrecks, nuclear tests, settlement, abandonment, hope, loss. Tristan da Cunha really grabbed me for some reason.
