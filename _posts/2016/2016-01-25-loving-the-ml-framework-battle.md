title: "Loving the ML framework battle."

Facebook has open sourced [Torch](https://github.com/torch/torch7), Google has open sourced [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), and now Microsoft has responded with [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK) (Catchy name, guys). This is awesoem for startups, three great frameworks on reasonable licensing terms, and I am sure they are going to kill each other in an attempt to "win", which is going to result in a flow of tools and data available to the world at large, since part of winning is building the biggest community. If you are not one of these companies, and you think you need to build and promulgate your own ML framework, I would think hard about that decision.
