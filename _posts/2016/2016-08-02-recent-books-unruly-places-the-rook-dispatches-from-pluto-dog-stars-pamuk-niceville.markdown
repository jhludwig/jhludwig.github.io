- [Unruly Places](https://www.amazon.com/Unruly-Places-Spaces-Inscrutable-Geographies/dp/054410157X) by [![pluto](images/pluto.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/08/recent-books-unruly-places-the-rook-dispatches-from-pluto-dog-stars-pamuk-niceville/pluto/)Alastair Bonnett. The stories behind some of the most unusual and unlikely places on the globe -- places belonging to no nation, to many nations, floating, underground, in the sky -- and an understanding of the meaning and importance of place.  Enjoyable.  
- [The Rook](https://www.amazon.com/Rook-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316098809) and [Stiletto](https://www.amazon.com/Stiletto-Novel-Files-Daniel-OMalley/dp/0316228044) by Daniel O'Malley. Great suspenseful adventure in a world filled with magic --  kind of a grown-up Harry Potter milieu.  The first page grabs you -- the protagonist awakens with no memory, in a park surrounded by bodies, and in her pocket is a note that says "Read Me". Stiletto isn't quite as strong but still a fund read.  
- [Dispatches From Pluto](https://www.amazon.com/Dispatches-Pluto-Found-Mississippi-Delta-ebook/dp/B00UDCNM82) by Richard Grant. An English adventure writer decides to settle in the Mississippi Delta. Interesting look at the culture and issues of a part of the country that seems almost foreign to me.  
- [The Dog Stars](https://www.amazon.com/Dog-Stars-Peter-Heller-ebook/dp/B007GZELF2) by Peter Heller. A different kind of post-apocalyptic novel, the world has largely been emptied out, a very few people try to find their way and remain human.  
- [A Strangeness In My Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Strangeness-my-Mind-novel-ebook/dp/B00SPVZA4C) by Orhan Pamuk. Tried to lift my literary sights, but as always, "Nobel Prize Winning" does not equal "interesting".  
- [Niceville](https://www.amazon.com/Niceville-Trilogy-Vintage-Crime-Lizard/dp/030774535X) by Carsten Stroud. Not a nice place. Solid horror/mystery.
