- [A Doubter's Almanac](http://www.amazon.com/Doubters-Almanac-Novel-Ethan-Canin-ebook/dp/B00X2FDZ70) by Ethan Canin[![almanac](images/almanac.jpeg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/03/recent-books-a-doubters-almanac-dragon-day-the-alchemist-of-souls-all-the-birds-in-the-sky-chimera-the-victoria-vanishes/almanac/). Fantastic story of a misanthropic obsessive genius and how he impacted family and friends around him. An incredibly unlikeable and yet sympathetic main character. Very good.
- [Dragon Day](http://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Day-Ellie-McEnroe-Novel-ebook/dp/B00RKQ657E) by Lisa Brackmann. Solid detective tale set in modern day China, where it seems everyone is out for their own advantage, and justice is a hard thing to find.
- [The Alchemist of Souls](http://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Souls-Nights-Masque-ebook/dp/B005411EL4) by Anne Lyle. Fantasy set in the early days of the New World exploration, with a New World quite different than ours, peopled by a non-human race. Entertaining, not sure I am driven to keep up with the series tho.
- [All the Birds in the Sky](http://www.amazon.com/All-Birds-Charlie-Jane-Anders-ebook/dp/B00W190RPG) by Charlie Jane Anders. It's the end of the world, maybe, and two childhood friends come together to save it, one with a deep science background, one with a deep mystical background. Good characters but I felt it kind of dissolved into mystical goo.
- [Chimera](http://www.amazon.com/Chimera-Parasitology-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B00X47ZY9S) by Mira Grant. The last in a 3 book series about semi-intelligent and autonomous tapeworms invading human beings. OK it was fun at times but probably 1 book too long.
- [The Victoria Vanishes](http://www.amazon.com/Victoria-Vanishes-Peculiar-Crimes-Mystery-ebook/dp/B0013TPXD6) by Christopher Fowler. Fun tale of two aging detectives investigating a very very strange set of murders. I've read another in series, solid characters.
