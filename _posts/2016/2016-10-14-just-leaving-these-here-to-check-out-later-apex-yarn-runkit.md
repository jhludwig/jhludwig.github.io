[http://apex.run](http://Easy server less setup with Apex). The "getting started" page is about 5x longer than it should be but I am intrigued

[Yarn , a new package manager for javascript](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360) -- seems well motivated

[Runkit, a hosted node playground](https://runkit.com/home) -- might be cool. Maybe.
