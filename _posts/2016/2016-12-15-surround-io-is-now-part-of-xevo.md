Been working on this for quite a while, our team is now part of Xevo (xevo.com). Very excited to join Xevo, the founder of Xevo is Satoshi Nakajima, former colleague at Ignition and at Microsoft, someone who I have long enjoyed working with. And the rest of the team at Xevo is just great, and they have a great existing position in the automotive market. We'll be focusing our technology on solutions in this space which is exciting -- real problems, the ability to deploy to tens of millions of customers, with very demanding technology at the forefront of the industry -- machine learning, cloud, iot. Really looking forward to expanding our team, building the business, and making a difference.

I'm a little busy this week with work and personal stuff but ping me if you want to catch up...
