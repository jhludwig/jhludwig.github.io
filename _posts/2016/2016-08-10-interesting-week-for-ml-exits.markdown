Congrat's to Seattle's [Turi](https://turi.com/), acquired by Apple. And congrats to [Nervana](https://www.nervanasys.com) and to Brad and Chris at [Fuel](http://www.fuelcapital.com/), in what seems to be a great exit. The markups on ML companies are tremendous -- not surprising given the dramatic impact ML is having.

I'd expect to see many more dramatic ML exits.
