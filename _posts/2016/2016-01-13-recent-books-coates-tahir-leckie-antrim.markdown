Is this thing on?

- [Between the World and Me](http://www.amazon.com/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0812993543) by Ta-Nehisi Coates. A challenging but important read. It is difficult to really comprehend the road that less privileged have had to travel, but it is important to try to understand and address.[![9780316246682_custom-b990a1e1d99f5af6bd343b01493a274a4b8e6a6e-s400-c85](images/9780316246682_custom-b990a1e1d99f5af6bd343b01493a274a4b8e6a6e-s400-c85.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/01/recent-books-coates-tahir-leckie-antrim/9780316246682_custom-b990a1e1d99f5af6bd343b01493a274a4b8e6a6e-s400-c85/)
- [An Ember in the Ashes](http://www.amazon.com/Ember-Ashes-Sabaa-Tahir/dp/1595148035) by Sabaa Tahir. Yet another dystopian YA trilogy, but well written and very enjoyable.
- [Ancillary Mercy](http://www.amazon.com/Ancillary-Mercy-Imperial-Radch-Leckie/dp/0316246689) by Ann Leckie. Third in the series and it is still holding up. Fascinating far future tale of empire and intrigue with a very unique set of ideas about identity.
- [The Verificationist](http://www.amazon.com/Verificationist-Novel-Donald-Antrim/dp/0312662149) by Donald Antrim. Very well written, the self-absorbed main character is having a breakdown or trip, and you are along for the ride.
- [Moxyland](http://www.amazon.com/Moxyland-Lauren-Beukes-ebook/dp/B01922I24M) by Lauren Beukes. Eh, near future spread of technology through the less developed world. Some nice ideas but ultimately bored me.
