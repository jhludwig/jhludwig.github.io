- [The Boys In The Boat](http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Boat-Americans-Berlin-Olympics/dp/0143125478) [![sladehouse](images/sladehouse.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/01/recent-books-boys-in-the-boat-phishing-slade-house/sladehouse/)by Daniel James Brown. Recommended by almost everyone else in the family, this is a great tale of the UW crew team which went to the Berlin Olympics. Especially interesting probably to Seattle residents, but very well written. I had no idea that crew was such a popular sport at the time.
- [Phishing for Phools](http://www.amazon.com/Phishing-Phools-Economics-Manipulation-Deception/dp/0691168318) by George Akerlof and Robert Shiller. OK I have great empathy for the material, an expose of how we are manipulated and deceived (and how we buy into this). But the book honestly was a little thin, I would have liked more examples and depth.
- [Slade House](http://www.amazon.com/Slade-House-Novel-David-Mitchell/dp/0812998685) by David Mitchell. Lord can this man write, I love everything he touches. A great creepy haunted house tale, written in the Mitchell style. Hard to put down.
