**Outlook 11**. Pointed to by[EVHEAD](http://www.evhead.com/archives/2002_12_01_archive_default.asp#103929232407237116). Eliminates need (along with Exchange upgrade) for vpns -- that alone seems worth the upgrade. I wonder what % of vpns are installed just for exchange. I think VPN vendors will be unhappy.
