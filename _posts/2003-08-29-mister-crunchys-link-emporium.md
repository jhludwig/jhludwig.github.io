[Mister Crunchy's Link Emporium](http://www.mistercrunchy.com/page2.html "Mister Crunchy's Link Emporium") -- i really like this as a handy single page guide to my personal view of the web. Once Halloween is behind me I may take on the job of building a page like this for myself. Security is an issue tho as I am not sure I want everyone to see all parts of my personal home page.
