[Engadget Exclusive: Your phone is obsolete - AT&T Wireless requiring customers to replace their phones - Engadget - www.engadget.com](http://www.engadget.com/entry/5326780577844212/ "Engadget Exclusive: Your phone is obsolete - AT&T Wireless requiring customers to replace their phones - Engadget - www.engadget.com") -- crap i just got the moto smartphone. They better make me a good offer.

(As an aside, I love the fact that engadget and gizmodo are now trying to beat each other on the gadget news front -- twice as much news now!)
