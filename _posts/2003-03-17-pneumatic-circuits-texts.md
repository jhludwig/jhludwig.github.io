**Pneumatic Circuits Texts**. After looking at many of these, this seems like the best one -- [Fluid Power: Theory and Applications (4th Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0137555881/qid=1047928378/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-9976079-5886236?v=glance&s=books&n=507846). A couple of very good chapters with the basic calculations for sizing components, valves, reservoirs, and compressors. I was surprised at how expensive textbooks had become -- back in the day, they cost me $25 new or less used. Now they are $100 new. Wow.
