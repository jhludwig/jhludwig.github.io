Another hiking area close to home is [the Mercer Slough](http://www.ci.bellevue.wa.us/page.asp?view=2106). Not that much altitude variation but a really beautiful wetlands area -- ferns, dense trees and brush, waterways, birds of all sorts. It was pouring by the time I was done this morning -- but that just added to the beauty of the place, it is all about water and life.
