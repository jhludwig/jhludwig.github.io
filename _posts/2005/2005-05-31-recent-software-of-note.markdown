\* Via [Larkware](http://www.larkware.com/dg3/TheDailyGrind628.html), [Backbase](http://www.backbase.com/index.php#2) looks like it is trying to commercialize AJAX technology. \* Via [the javascript weblog](http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000897043640/), [a cool javascript.dhtml comment implementation](http://www.snook.ca/archives/000365.html). Also a [nice AJAX patterns wiki.](http://www.ajaxpatterns.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). I'm not sure what the investment opportunity is yet...but non-AJAX websites are going to look old and boring compared to AJAX sites very soon... \* Rich likes [MTInlineEditor](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/blogs/2005/05/19/mtinlineeditor.html). I dont' do that much editting after the fact (perhaps a problem) but it seems cool. Hey I wonder when someone will do nice AJAX templates for MT -- crap, if I thought of it, someone must have already done it. \* I feel stupid for not having switched to [password composer yet](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/05/31.html#a1241) -- here's another good reason, a website implementation. \* I wish there was an implementation of tinyurl or [doiop](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/05/18/Doiop.html) that I could run on my own server so I could exert some control over keywords. \* Via [geekman](http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Netcool.html), a nice listing of [web applications](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/21/03045/5568) \-- SEO, design tools, etc \* Back on the PC, [BeSweet for transcoding audio](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/home_movies/2005/05/16/besweet.html), [how to bookmark registry locations](http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=296), [using grc's wizmo to unfreeze a machine](http://www.spywareinfo.com/newsletter/archives/2005/may25.php#wizmo), [a nice pc inspection tool (website currently down)](http://www.cpuid.org/pcw.php#download), [speedfan](http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php) for managing fans and temps, [broadcast machine](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/05/broadcast_machi.html) for sharing video.
