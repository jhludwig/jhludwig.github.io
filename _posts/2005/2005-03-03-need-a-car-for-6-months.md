I need a car for about 6 months to use up on Lopez Island. You can do long term rentals at places like [Budget](http://www.budget.com/bbtm/) but very expensive.

Assuming an existing lease may be the way to go -- [Swapalease](http://www.swapalease.com/) and [Leasetrader](http://www.leasetrader.com/) both seem to have a lot of inventory.

I wonder if contacting some local leasing agents directly might not be the smartest thing to do -- they must have some leases in default that they need someone to pick up.
