\* [Phil finds a dhtml spell checker](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/07/emil-eklunds-dhtml-spell-checker.html). Cool. \* Steve finds cool software to [turn pocket pcs into aux displays](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/07/how_to_make_a_v.html). I have a spare one sitting around, I should do something with. Maybe i could turn it into a little live photo displayer on my desk. \* I'm a sucker for outliners so I will try [this](http://support.opml.org/download) at some point. Man I wish I could use on the bberry as well. \* In case your windows machine is too stable -- [running windows with no services](http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/07/running-windows-with-no-services.html) and [registry edits for windows xp](http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Windows.html). Don't call me if you screw around with these. \* [Bluephoneelite](http://www.tipmonkies.com/2005/07/23/bluephoneelite-your-new-call-center) seems way cool. At various times in my career I've been involved with teams trying to manage your online presence -- BluePhoneElite seems like the right way to do it -- my phone is always with me, and I can use a nearby PC to augment my messaging and call experience as appropriate. \* [Sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com/). For the architect-wannabe inside me. My first real career ambition (when I was 14) was to be an architect and I am a sucker for the tools. \* [Udell on federated tagging](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/07/22.html#a1274). Interesting. \* The reason I haven't actually installed any of the above -- [Battlefield 2](http://www.eagames.com/official/battlefield/battlefield2/us/home.jsp)
