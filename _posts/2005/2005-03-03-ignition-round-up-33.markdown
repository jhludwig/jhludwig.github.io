\* Brad has a nice article up at [BW Online](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2005/tc2005033_6414.htm), heavily influenced by Mssrs Tong and Zagula... \* ...following the nice press on Ignition [last week in the WSJ](http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/02/shout_out_to_ig.html) (thanks to Jobster dudes for the link) \* Not an ignition blog but a nice pithy maxim about our business from [A VC](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/03/vc_cliche_of_th.html): "Momentum venture investing is an oxymoron and anyone who does it is a moron." \* [Martin is hooked on Windows Remote Desktop](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/02/microsoft_remot.html). Me too, but now I have a Mac Mini in the house and may have to try some others again... \* [Nice link by Martin](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/02/declaring_energ.html) to a good article on energy independence \* Rich as always has a whole potpourri of links -- [Gelsinger on virtualization](http://www.geekfishing.net/consumer/pcs/2005/03/02/intel_virtualization_technology.html) (rich has been high on this for a while), [some great small pc links](http://www.geekfishing.net/consumer/pcs/2005/03/01/mocha_p4_5043.html), a bunch of links to [things we talked about over breaks at our LP meeting](http://www.geekfishing.net/online/blogs/2005/03/01/lp_meeting_urls.html) including bit comet.
