Ok well really this is the [Jobster](http://www.jobster.com) blogging roundup.

\* Jason on [Where do you want to be in 5 years?](http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/12/where_do_you_wa.html). Great interview question -- and moreover a great question to ask yourself every week and see if you are on the path or not. \* Phil's data on [what people are looking for when mobile](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/11/mobile-zeitgeist-mobile-search-usage-statistics/). I am proud to have driven "buckeyes" so high in the rankings. \* Phil has also added [more sports capability to berry411](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/11/sports-search-in-berry-411/)
