This [Seattle Times series on Infospace](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002198103_dotcon1main06.html ) is fascinating and brutal. An incredible collection of misbehaviour. I am very glad Rick Thompson comes out looking relatively good as he is a first class guy who was stuck in an ugly situation.
