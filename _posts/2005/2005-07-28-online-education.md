Article about [online colleges](http://www.twincities.com/mld/pioneerpress/news/local/12157427.htm) -- you can get real phds from places like [walden](http://www.waldenu.edu) and capella and [nova](http://www.nova.edu). Early days yet but I am betting these programs grow in popularity and quality -- the traditional college system just doesn't work that well for someone in their 30s or 40s who wants to learn new skills or refresh their education. Personally I thought about going back and getting a PhD after I left Microsoft, but the structure of a traditional program is designed for young people with lots of free time and no other responsibilities. Just doesn't fit my life that well.
