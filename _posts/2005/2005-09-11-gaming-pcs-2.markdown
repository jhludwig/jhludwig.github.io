So [rich looked at some gaming pcs recently](http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/08/31/gaming_pc_off_the_shelf.html) -- the big brands of alien, voodoo, and falcon nw. I'm in the market soon for a new pc and looked at their sites. On the way, A9 and Google pointed me towards some other contenders: [Hypersonic](http://www.hypersonic-pc.com/2001/index.asp) in New York, and [WidowPC](http://www.widowpc.com/) in Texas -- the Widow guys are particularly aggressive at trying to get gaming pc search traffic.

And PC Mag mentions [ABS](http://www.abspc.com/index.asp) and [Velocity Micro](http://www.velocitymicro.com/index.php) as options.

The Widow systems seem to have the most extreme config options. I'm tempted to try them.
