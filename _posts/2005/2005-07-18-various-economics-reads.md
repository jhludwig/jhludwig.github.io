\* [Mandarin Chinese in schools](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/07/mandarin_chines.html). Hear hear. It would be interesting to see a complete curriculum redesign for the next century. I'd certainly think Chinese should be in the curriculum. I wonder how you might change the sciences curriculum -- traditional chemistry seems like a bit of a dinosaur to me, I'd rather see more physics and computer science. \* [Storage industry facts](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/07/facts_about_sto.html) -- _"...an industry that now exceeds the revenues of Hollywood..."_ \* [Open Source economics models](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/06/open_source_eco.html). I wonder how broadly the ideas of open source can apply. \* The [sports economist on the implications of the nba age floor](http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2005_07_01__arch_file.htm#112108175430937083) -- the rise of private development leagues funded by talent agencies. Fascinating, perhaps a great outcome for athletes who aren't college-oriented.
