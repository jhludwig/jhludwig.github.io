Motivated to post this by someone who saw my gear bag and asked where to get one. I carry a bag from [Duluth Trading](http://www.duluthtrading.com/store/catbrief.asp) -- designed for tools but I use for carrying around all my gear. (I use them for tools too -- one for pneumatic, one for electric, one for electronics, etc).

In the bag or on my person I carry: \* [Blackberry 7210](http://www.blackberry.com/) with ATTWS service. I'm not going to move to one of the 7100s, I like the full keyboard \* [iPod Photo](http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/). The photo functionality is lame but at least I have a backup of all my photos now. \* [Etymotics Er6](http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/er6.asp) earphones. Love these. Theyv'e been very durable. \* [JVC subnotebook](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001447.html). The best subnotebook I could find when I looked months ago. There may be better choices now. I like a subnotebook because I can easily carry it anywhere. And I am not trying to replace a desktop. \* This [great connector kit](http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=ULT31434&cat=NBB) that [rich](http://www.tongfamily.com) got me. \* Blackberry and iPod wallwarts tho I think I can consolidate here \* [Casio Exilim](http://www.casio.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=products.section&catalog=Cameras&section=EXILIM%20Series) camera. An older model but may upgrade in the next year or so. \* Usually 3-4 books. Right now i have "Democracy in America":amazon, "The Fermata":amazon, and "A Coffin for Demetrios":amazon \* Business papers \* A couple empty notebooks and pens
