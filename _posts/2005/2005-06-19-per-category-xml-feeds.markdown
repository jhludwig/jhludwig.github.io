I've added per-category XML feeds to my blog -- helpful guidance at [Learning Movable Type](http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/000458simple_rss_customizations.php). They are all at www.theludwigs.com/archives/.xml.

So what? Well now I can create meaningful tagclouds for my categories. I've got one for the [most recent posts for the whole blog](http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/theludwigs/default/50). But more interestingly I've got one [for just my halloween postings](http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwighalloween/default/50) -- this gives a great sense of what topics dominate my halloween category, what themes are most popular. And is a nice way to autogenerate tags and hierarchy for the category -- I don't have to do any work! I've just added one for [my book posts as well](http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwigbooks/default/50) (not yet updated) and [my software posts](http://www.tagcloud.com/cloud/html/ludwigsoftware/default/50) (also not yet updated).

Now it would be even cooler if i could yoke tinyurl functionality to this, so that you could ask for the page www.theludwigs.com/faulkner or www.theludwigs.com/books/faulkner and my site would find the tag in a tagcloud and return the relevant page. Some people have posted [sample tinyurl clone code in response to ed's posting](http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBott-WindowsandOfficeExpertise?m=374 ), in my copious free time i may look at this. I want my own tinyurl functionality anyway for other reasons.
