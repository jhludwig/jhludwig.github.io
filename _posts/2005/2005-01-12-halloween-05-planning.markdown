So doing early Halloween '05 planning. I've talked about [my ideas to substantially update my sound system](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001765.html), and in talking to my local theatrical supply house, [PNTA](http://www.pnta.com/), I've been pointed to [SFX from Stageresearch](http://www.stageresearch.com/) as potentially the right control package for my audio needs. I'll be digging into this month.

Other random halloween things that have caught my eye:

\* Assuming i go to a centralized sound console like above, i'll want a wireless remote for it. So i can change up the sounds from anywhere in the yard. Need to understan[d these wireless mixer controls](http://www.frontierdesign.com/products/tranzmain.html) better. \* [Shapelock moldable plastic](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000623.php) seems like to could be great for making a lot of props, gravestone elements, etc. \* I used some of [these zwave controllers](http://homeseer.american-data.net/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=HS&Category_Code=ZWAVE) this past year. way more robust than x10. A little goofy to program. \* Want to try some m[at switches](http://www.earthsands.com/holiday/halloween/propsswitchmats.html) this year too.
