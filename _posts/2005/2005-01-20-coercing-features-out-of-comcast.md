Hey rich has been having trouble getting the new microsoft/moto dvr box from comcast -- rich here is [my blog entry on that](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001712.html).

Also I ordered a [cablecard](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=792) from comcast today for my [new sharp lcdtv](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001775.html) \-- also impossible to find on the comcast website -- call the same number as above and ask for a cablecard. they'll try to talk you out of it but eventually they will cave.

Other random tv links while I'm thinking about:

\* [Palm sized DLP projector](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1749550,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532) -- cool! \* Extremetech's [guide to building your own media center pc](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1741030,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532) \* [Steve's thoughts on the ideal tv-attached box](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/that_was_close.html) -- I've personally been sucked into the mac mini mania and have ordered one for this application.
