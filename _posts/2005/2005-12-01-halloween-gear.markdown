Latest links culled mostly from the [MoM Forum](http://www.methodzofmadness.com/)

\* [Simple Dimmer](http://store.qkits.com/moreinfo.cfm/MX056). Lots of other kits and components here too. \* [Simple prop controllers](http://www.parallaxefx.com/) and some nice application notes like [this skull idea](http://www.parallaxefx.com/dl/AppNotes/AppNoteFX00002.zip) (zipped pdf) \* I'm sure I've blogged this before, [the hauntmaster controller](http://www.hauntmasterproducts.com/9.html) -- "The Flex ECT is an externally triggered, dual timer that is connected between a sensor (switch) and the electrically operated event device as shown in the diagram to the right" \* Plans to [build your own event control timer.](http://www.hauntedillinois.com/fogtimer.php) \* A range of [LED fixtures and drivers](http://www.luxeonstar.com/). Seems like all halloween lighting should move to LED over time? \* Some hints in here on [silencing pneumatic solenoids](http://www.deathlord.net/Lynching/lynch8.htm) -- the exhaust noise doesn't really bother me but maybe I will want to do this some day. \* Some [very basic intro guides to haunt lighting](http://www.biasedopinion.com/lighting.aspx) \* [Lighting control units](http://www.animatedlighting.com/products/buildyourownshow.asp). These look like overkill to me, better for Christmas applications.
