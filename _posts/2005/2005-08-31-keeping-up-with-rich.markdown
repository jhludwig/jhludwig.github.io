As usual [Rich](http://www.tongfamily.com) has been a posting machine during the last month. Some of the highlights I've noted:

\* [Iceland travel](http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/11/iceland.html). I hear they have some fantastic river rafting there. I'm ready to go. Just added to my [43places](http://www.43places.com) goals. \* [Grilling resource](http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/14/perfect_ribs_and_grilled_chicken.html) -- I can always use grilling tips. \* Rich's [small camera recos](http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/08/14/casio_exlim_exz750.html). I'm about due. \* [Tips on HT PC setup](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/home_theater/2005/08/22/zoomplayer_rules.html) -- sounds like zoomplayer is essential. \* [NTFS resizing tips](http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/2005/08/26/ntfs_resizing.html). I am sure I will need these some day. \* Rich is playing [FEAR](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/games/2005/08/31/fear.html). I think I need a new PC. \* [Rich on Gaming PCs](http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/hardware/2005/08/31/gaming_pc.html). Having bought 3 and bult 2 others, I am inclined to buy from Falcon Northwest for my next. Debugging the assembly of a high end machine with 2 SLI cards, 10K sata drives, raid arrays, fast dvd/cd drives -- well it is just a lot easier to let the Falcon guys burn their time.
