OK we missed the most recent episode of Desparate Housewives while we were in Hawaii. I hadn't kept up to date on bittorrent in the last couple months so time to try again.

Went to download [Azureus](http://azureus.sourceforge.net/). Oops, needed the [SUN JRE](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp) first. Installed the JRE, then Azureus. Both pretty painless tho the Sun website has way too much info on it.

Then off to http://www.torrents.co.uk which is a great source of TV torrents. Found the Desparate Housewives episode which aired on 12/20, and started up the download. Very painless, full HDTV quality, no commercials.

And once done, it played perfectly in the [Divx player](http://www.divx.com/divx/) that I already had installed, so I didn't have to hunt around for one of these, tho there seem to be a number of alternatives out there.

OK so now I could play this great looking show in my office, but I really wanted it down in the family room, and i don't have a media center pc yet. So I thought gee, I'll just burn it onto a DVD and go!

This is where everything turned to crap. First off, i tried a bunch of different DVD burning tools that I had on my machines -- most of them bundleware with DVD burners. [Ulead](http://www.ulead.com/runme_ns.htm), [sonic mydvd](http://www.sonic.com/products/mydvd/deluxesuite/default.asp) were a couple of them. None of them could parse the downloaded show. So I googled around and downloaded a few more -- [HT Burn](http://www.honestech-e.com/us/product28.asp), [DVD Lab Pro](http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/historypro.html). Nope they couldn't import the show either.

Figuring I had some strange codec problem i downloaded [Videoinspector](http://www.kcsoftwares.com/index.php?vtb), this was pretty helpful. Analyzed the show, and claimed I didn't have the necessary [xvid codec](http://www.xvid.org/) (tho how did the divx player play the show then???) and took me right to a download site. Ok so i installed but I still had trouble getting any DVD authoring software to consume the file. [tmpgenc](http://www.tmpgenc.net/e_main.html) seemed to be able to crack the file thought to what end I am not sure. DVD lab pro hung hard.

After the hard hang i updated [my sony dvd burner firmware](http://sony.storagesupport.com/dvdrw/dru530adwn.htm) and checked my bios and scsi/sata firmware, all ok. Still I could never coerce anything into burning a dvd, ht burn got the furthest and actually burnt the video but no audio.

So I gave up. We all watched the show in my office.

What have I learned? The last time I tried to burn DVDs in earnest was about 6 months ago. The software sucked then. It still sucks now. And the other learning is -- get a media center PC.
