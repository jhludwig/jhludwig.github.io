Phil Bogle of [Jobster](http://www.jobster.com) is one great guy. Now he has created [Searchme](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/new-utility-add-your-editorial-voice.html) -- makes it easy to create a google search spanning multiple sites. I've added the ability to search all ignition blogs over in the search sidebar area.

Phil used the tool himself to create a [job search across all ignition portfolio companies.](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/search-for-jobs-in-ignition-portfolio.html)

Great stuff.
