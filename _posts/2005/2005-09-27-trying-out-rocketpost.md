[Rocketpost](http://www.anconia.com/rocketpost/), another blog editing client. Nice looking, pretty full featured.  One brilliant feature -- copy a link from your browser or aggregator, select text in your post, and CTRL-J turns the text into a link.  Huge huge time savings.  Nice work [Manish](http://www.vij.com/).
