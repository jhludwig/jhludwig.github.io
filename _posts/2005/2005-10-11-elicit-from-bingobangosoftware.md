Testing out yet another blog posting tool -- elicit from [bingobangosoftware](http://http//www.bingobangosoftware.com/makemoney.htm).  A very unique take on blog posting -- very focused on helping semipro bloggers manage their posting rate and their affiliate income.  Easy to add affiliate links, easy to manage your stream of posts thru a calendaring interface.  I don't know yet if I like the tool but I admire the inventiveness.

**UPDATE**: OK on initial testing some goods and bads:

\* Good: the scheduler worked perfectly. You can create posts for arbitrary times and they will be posted at that time. I realize there are many other tools to do this, but the outlook-like calendar interface is very nice. \* So-so: doesn't respect mt text processing plugins like textile 2 -- but has a full wysiwyg editor and html editor so maybe that is ok \* Bad: doesn't seem to post keywords correctly. Wraps the entry in tags. and most strangely, enters the post body in both the entry body and extended entry fields -- not helpful!!
