One of our earliest investments, [RLX, was purchased by HP](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/03/hp_buys_rlx/).  Congrats guys!  This article is a little critical of the company, no surprise, theregister is generally pretty snarky.  But they give credit where credit is due -- _"RLX pioneered the blade server market, offering compact systems well before any of the Tier 1 vendors."_  It was great to be involved with these guys.
