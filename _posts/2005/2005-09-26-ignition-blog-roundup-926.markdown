\* Phil thinks [it would be great to listen to podcasts on his cellphone](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/listening-to-podcasts-on-any-cellphone/). Totally agree. I would listen to like 10x as many if I could use the cell. \* Phil talks about [Jobster's culture and how they encourage innovation](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/creating-a-successful-20-for-innovation-program/) -- lifting the 20% idea from Google. \* Phil on the [latest features in Berry411](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/09/berry-411-updates/). I fyou have a blackberry and don't have berry411, get going!

Maybe this entry should just be called "keeping up with phil". Oh wait, Rich on [online sites for trading in mileage points](http://www.tongfamily.com/travel/2005/09/21/pointscom_and_priorityrewards_club.html). Good stuff, I have a lot of idle miles.
