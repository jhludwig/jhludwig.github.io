[Microsoft buys Groove](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+to+buy+Groove+Networks/2100-1014_3-5608063.html?tag=nefd.top) and Ray Ozzie named CTO. Because you can never have enough CTOs, joining [David Vaskevitch](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/dvaskevitch/default.asp) and [Craig Mundie](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/craig/default.asp).

Two more and they have a basketball team!
