[Great pointer on marginal revolution to a discussion of earthquake survival](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/11/duck_and_cover_.html) -- basically asserting that the duck and cover strategy is a sure way to get killed, instead you want to huddle next to massive objects. Makes a lot of sense.
