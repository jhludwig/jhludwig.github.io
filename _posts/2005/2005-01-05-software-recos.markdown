I'm setting up a new machine soon, and mostly for myself, I'm documenting the full software set I need on the machine (or will need access to:)

\* OS: [Win xp pro](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx). I use the remote desktop feature a lot within the house and between house and work, so XP Pro is necessary. I'm also evaluating [KnoppMyth](http://www.mysettopbox.tv/knoppmyth.html) and [Windows MCE 2005](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx) as I may use one of them on a media center machine soon... \* [AVG antivirus](http://www.grisoft.com/us/us_index.php). The price is right. \* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) of couse, tho I keep IE around to run WinUpdate and Outlook Web Access. ..and I have a lot of firefox extensions loaded, but the must-haves are Adblock, Tabbrowser Preferences, Download Manager Tweak, Googlebar, Searchkeys, and EditCSS. \* [Aim](http://www.aim.com). I don't have a love affair with AIM but other family members are committed to it, so I am too. \* [Adobe reader 7.0](http://www.adobe.com). The latest version is worth the download as it loads a lot faster. \* [Yahoo toolbar](http://toolbar.yahoo.com). Ok I don't actually care about the toolbar but the free spyware detector which is included makes the download worth it. \* [Azureus](http://azureus.sourceforge.net/) for bittorrent downloads. There are probably codec sets I need to download as well but I have forgotten them all, I will have to rediscover. [Videoinspector](http://www.kcsoftwares.com/index.php?vtb) is helpful in discovering what codecs i need. \* [Itunes](http://www.apple.com) of course, as I am an iPod user. For ripping I use [Exact Audio Copy](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/) and the codecs implied. \* [PKzip](http://www.pkzip.com/) or any other reasonable file compression/decompression utility. \* [Google Desktop](http://desktop.google.com). Actually I am not sure that I have to have this or not, it is still in the evaluation stage. The idea is nice -- but in practice I never seem to use it. \* [Outlook](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857931033.aspx) for accessing work email. Don't love it but it is a fact of life. Back when I was wearing the CIO hat for Ignition I tried to move us to some other server alternative but calendar management and people's familiarity drove us back to exchange and outlook. \* [Newsgator](http://www.newsgator.com) for feed reading. \* [Cloudmark](http://www.cloudmark.com) for spam control (ignition is an investor in cloudmark). \* one of [DZsoft](http://www.dzsoft.com/)'s tools for structured editting. Pretty lightweight which is all I need. I also use [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html). Oh and [Spread32](http://www.byedesign.freeserve.co.uk/) is a nice little spreadsheet -- I honestly don't need most of the function of office.

While I don't need these installed on every machine, I would feel remiss if I didn't mention [Movabletype](http://www.movabletype.org), [Activestate Perl](http://www.activestate.com), [Blogrolling](http://www.blogrolling.com), and [Sitemeter](http://www.sitemeter.com). I use these tools every single day, in many ways they are more irreplaceable than most of the desktop software I use.
