Jon Udell points to these great posts about [vm-enabled polycore computing.](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/01/13.html#a1150) Fascinating stuff. The writers are excited about server-side, datacenter applications. Personally I get way more excited about consumer applications. So not many consumers need to run thousands of vms simultaneously on their machines -- but cheap creation of ephemeral vms would be great, the end to spyware and viruses -- just give me a new instance of my "known good" vm every time i sit down, and throw it away when i get up -- any malware that managed to worm its way into the vm is gone.
