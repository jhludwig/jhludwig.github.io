OK you don't need another sweatshirt or t-shirt. You have 7 varieties of caps. You have the windbreaker. The flag. The posters, the books. The marching band records. The foam finger. A Brutus costume. The "Muck Fichigan" pin. So what do you need? Some fine ideas from the alumni mag:

\* The [Fossil watch](http://www.fossil.com/buckeyes). Ok not that exotic. \* The [scarlet or gray blazer](http://www.buckeyeblazer.com). Always in fashion. \* The [popcorn tin](http://www.thepopcornfactory.com/Ohio05). (Hey Marion, how did you let this business slip to some company in Virginia? Marion is the popcorn capital of the world!) \* The [marching band miniatures](http://www.littlebandman.com). \* Not one, but two varieties of Buckeye Coffee -- [Ohio State Varsity Blends](http://www.varsityblends.com/ohiostate) or [Drinkstorm](http://www.drinkstorm.com). Particularly apropo for Seattle area residents like me. \* Coffee cups and other pottery at [Hartstone Pottery](http://www.hartstonepottery.com) \* A [buckeye carpet](http://www.tru-fan.com). This would look great in the living room. \* A [buckeye park bench](http://www.sportswoodfurniture.com). And here is your living room furniture. \* And [a mural for the wall](http://www.gamedaymurals.com) -- won't they wonder about our civilization 1000 years from now when they dig this up. \* [Buckeye Crunch cereal](http://www.buckeyecrunch.com) -- the breakfast of true champions. \* Or a trip to an exotic part of the world with a group of alums -- [Alumni Tours](http://www.ohiostatealumni.org/tours). Nothing says buckeye pride like a trip down the Nile.

Enjoy! And I will accept any and all of these for the holidays.
