OK so this wasn't much of an opponent for the Buckeyes. The game had the feel of a scrimmage, OSU seemed to be running at 90% speed.

OSU is going to need 3 or 4 balls in play to get all the talent involved on the offensive. A plethora of skill position players -- 2 QBs, Ginn, several emerging tailbacks, a good receiving corps -- gosh this team could be the most explosive offensive team in the Tressel era if they can get it all together.

And the first string defense did a nice job shutting down Miami but not sure how much of a test this was. The Miami QB was very rattled early.

Huston did a nice job replacing Nugent. Hit on every opportunity.

I have to rant a little about ABC/ESPN/DirecTV. Halfway thru the 3rd, ABC cuts away to the Oklahoma game. OK I kind of get it, the OSU game was over, and the Oklahoma game was a huge upset. But I am paying DirecTV for the College Gameplan package so I can see every freaking game, and did they unblock the OSU game? No, they did not.

And just to top it off, with 5 minutes to go in the Oklahoma game, the local affiliate switches to the start of the UW/Air Force game! Grrr....
