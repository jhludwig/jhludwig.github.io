From the WSJ and other press, discussion of the [mosaic feature](http://www.mcall.com/business/local/all-mosaicaug31,0,4278363.story?coll=all-businesslocal-hed) coming to our TV screens -- watch 8 football games at once.

I think this is just brilliant. Football fans will pay for this. And further keeps the DSL guys at bay -- they can't even deliver one video stream, let alone 8 simultaneous games.

There is so much discussion about hollywood content, drm, iptv, etc -- we seem to forget that live sports may be a much more important driver of video in the home. Certainly in my household our video provider selections are driven by sports programming issues -- college game packages, hdtv availability, etc.
