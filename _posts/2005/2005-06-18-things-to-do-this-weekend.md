In case you find yourself in Seattle with time on your hands:

\* A friend recommends the following hikes: Lake Serene near Index off Highway 2, and Mount Pilchuck off the Mountain Loop Highway. \* He also recommends [Attrition.WS](http://www.attrition.ws/) for trail info. \* In an entirely different direction, [Raymond recommends the Seattle International Juggling Festival.](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/13/428535.aspx ) I bet this would be a hoot.
