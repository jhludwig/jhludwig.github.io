From the last month or so:

\* [Mozilla calendar](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/12/08.html#a1129). Calendaring is what keeps our business tied to exchange, sure would like to look at some alternatives. Webdav required here, I have always found webdav to be impossible to set up correctly. \* [Johnza finds the latest from 37signals -- tada lists.](http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/01/19/tada_lists_keeping_is_simple.html) I'm a dedicated user of my blackberry todo list, I'd need this to sync with blackberry \* [Tutorial on writing firefox extensions](http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000123025949/). Looks like a pretty low learning curve, no wonder there are so many. \* [43 things](http://rasterweb.net/raster/2005/01/18/43-crazy-things/ ), the latest craze. I created a short list. I don't really want to spew my personal content all over the web tho, i want these guys to aggregate my list from my own blog. \* [the no-follow tag](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/18.html#a9229 ). here's hoping that mt does a rev that just slams all the right html all over my blog, i don't want to go fix all this myself. \* [Microsoft shuts down passport service.](http://go.theregister.com/feed/2004/12/30/ms_ends_pass/) Classic example of trying to force a platform down people's throats, instead of just creating something of great utility. A very predictable end. Platforms become platforms because they are popular, not because anyone says they are a platform. \* [Slashdot on bandwidth enabling 3rd party servicing of pcs in the home and business.](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/02/1511236&from=rss) I totally believe in this. [Pure networks](http://www.purenetworks.com) is on the path to this, it is one of the primary reasons we are betting on this space.
