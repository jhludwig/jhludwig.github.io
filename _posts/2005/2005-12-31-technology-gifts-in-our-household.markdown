Very happy with the the [ipod video](http://www.apple.com/ipod/) and [ipod nano](http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/). the nano is just so nice looking.

Reasonably happy with the [Xbox360](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/). Nice hardware, everything works well. And looks glorious on highdef. But the games are not very exciting yet.

Happy with the [Plantronics 640 bluetooth headset](http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/products/cat1150057/cat5420035/prod29780004). Comes with a nice accessory kit. Good sound quality.

Incomplete on the [widowpc](http://www.widowpc.com/) gaming pc. The unit that I received had a malfunctioning liquid cooling system -- air in the tubes, vapor lock in the pump. Had to ship back. still waiting....
