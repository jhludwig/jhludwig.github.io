\* "Light, by M. John Harrison":amazon. Good science fiction romp -- quantum behaviour brought into our everyday lives -- very imaginative. \* "Fairyland, by Paul J. McAuley":amazon. A near future story involving the extreme interplay of cypernetics, nanotech, and genetic engineering -- quite inventive intermixing of these and their impact on humans and human society. Characters sometimes a little thin -- or maybe so transhuman as to be unsympathetic. Deftly handled resolution -- didn't try to answer every question. Of these first two books, I'd read Fairyland. \* "Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress":amazon. Very funny. After reading this, I feel like I have been too grown up my entire life. My favorite line -- describing a modern modular wall entertainment center as the "deathstar of furniture".
