Via [scoble](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/10/30/one-guy-at-microsoft-i-wished-blogged-more/), [charles' blog](http://www.platformonomics.com/). Brilliant guy. One of the people at MSFT I really miss working with. Wish your blog didn't look like crap in firefox, charles. Other great MSFTees I see leaving via [minimsft](http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/10/two-microsofties-depart-and-bloggity.html) -- hadi partovi and don gagne. Also great guys and also wish i had the chance to work with them again.
