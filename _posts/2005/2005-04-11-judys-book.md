added a new section to my sidebar, a summary of my postings on judy's book (an ignition investment). this is cool, i am far more likely to post at judy's book now as i can see a summary of my activity back here on my own page. i'd love to be able to bring my judy's book posts inline into my blog -- interspersed naturally with posts i've done here. I guess with some coding i could do that but i am lazy, i just want some MT tags that let me aggregate posts from N places into one stream on this page.
