Recent items of note:

\* [One man's list of blackberry add-ons](http://www.mobilewhack.com/pda/blackberry/whats_on_emorys.html) -- Phil's 411 app gets a nice mention. \* [Rootkitrevealer](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/rootkitreveal.shtml). Not really sure I know how to make the most of this but another nice tool to sniff out malware. \* Haven't tried [Replay Music](http://www.replay-music.com/faq.php) yet but seems to be the ultimate tool to bypass all the lame DRM in various players \* Another great list of small software utilities -- [Pricelessware](http://www.pricelessware.org/thelist/index.htm) \* Thanks to [Jon Udell for the pointer to Linky](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/01/14.html#a1151), a great firefox extension. \* [Logparser 2.2](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/logparser_22.html). Loved earlier versions, haven't had time to play with this yet. \* Via [Mike Gunderloy](http://www.larkware.com/dg2/TheDailyGrind557.html), [XMLMarker](http://www.symbolclick.com/) \-- great little XML editor.

Sadly I have no great utilities to recommend to [Steve](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/backup_strategi.html) for home/consumer-oriented backup -- I too have a ton of storage at home, I use scripts to copy precious data to backup locations every night, very kludgey but cheap.
