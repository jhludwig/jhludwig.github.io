This weekend's best hike was up Squak Mountain. [The City of Issaquah website lists trailheads](http://www.ci.issaquah.wa.us/page.asp?navid=526) -- we started at Mountainside Drive. Nice steady uphill hike for 2 miles -- gets the heart pumping, but not so extreme that it kills you.

It is a state park but for some reason the [state park website](http://www.parks.wa.gov/alpha.asp) doesn't list it, and I found no good maps online. But the trails are well marked and pretty well maintained.
