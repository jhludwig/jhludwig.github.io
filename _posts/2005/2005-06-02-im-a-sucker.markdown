The hype sucked me, I got a [Dyson Ball](http://www.dyson.com/the-ball/default.asp?sinavtype=menu). I have to say, this thing is seriously cool. It really does have great suckage. Super easy to clean out. My only beef -- a cord you have to collect yourself is so 1980s, even my cheapo kenmore vacuum has a self-retracting cord.
