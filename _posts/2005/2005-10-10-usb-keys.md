I'm not a huge user of USB keys tho a lot of people are -- lots of excitement about these [keys evolving to contain your entire personalized computing environment](http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/09/1823222&from=rss).

I'd be more compelled to try using a key this way if a key was integrated into something I already have to carry -- my blackberry/cellphone, my car key fob, my ipod.
