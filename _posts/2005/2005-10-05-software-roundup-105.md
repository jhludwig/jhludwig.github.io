\* It's taken me a while to try Dave's [OPML](www.opml.org) editor, but [this enthusiastic article](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/29/opml-an-awesome-experiment/) got me off my ass.  I really want to love this as I am an outlining kind of guy.  But a) I use 5-6 PCs regularly and hate having to install this on all of them, why isn't it just a website?  b) I really wish it would sync with my bberry.  c) the default web rendering of outlines looks pretty plain (at least in the techcrunch example).  \* As [Ed Bott says](http://www.edbott.com/weblog/?p=1056), [Exact Audio Copy](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/) is a great way to get error-free CD rips. \* Newsgator empire keeps growing [with acquisition of netnewswire](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=783).  Man these guys seem to be building an interesting and deep company.  Love newsgator. \* [Gadgetopia found this claim about Windows Vista boot times](http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4384).  Man I hope this is true and really works.  I gave up on suspend and hibernate long ago because too many devices just didn't deal well with.  Of course I rarely turn my PCs off now...
