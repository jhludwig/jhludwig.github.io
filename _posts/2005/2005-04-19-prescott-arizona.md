After my forays this winter to [Duluth](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001776.html) and [el paso](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001832.html), I wasn't expecting much from the next stop in my tour of minor american cities -- prescott, arizona.

Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Prescott is a gem. High desert country -- great climate. Pleasantly treelined streets. Historical downtown which has largely been maintained. A little college influence. Lots of restaurants and arts for a small city. Biking, hiking trails abound. Great launch point for sidetrips to Sedona or Flagstaff.

I'd not be sad to go back.
