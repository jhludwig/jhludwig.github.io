I find these fascinating:

\* Fred is [openly soliciting podcast submissions](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=1173), he'll listen to whatever shows up. \* Rich [is selling an hour of his time (proceeds to charity) on ebay](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=46690&item=7524303188&ssPageName=STORE:PROMOBOX:GENERIC).

I'll be interested to hear if anything ever comes from these.
