\* Geez I am now like two generations behind on cooling technology -- [liquid metal coolers for pcs](http://www.nanocoolers.com/products_cooling.php), [liquid metal cooling for video cards](http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/22/194250&from=rss). My cooling problem though is a little different -- with 6 computers in 2 small rooms, plus printers, monitors, scanners, speakers, etc etc etc -- my problem is room temperature, not pc temperature. No amount of liquid metal cooling is going to make my room cooler. I have installed a small Carrier single-room air conditioner to deal with the issue -- so I guess that puts me at the bleeding edge of homes, not many have dedicated AC for computer rooms. So I salvage a little geek pride. \* I'd love to explore [using these bifurcated computers](http://www.cubix.com/ls/LSD_Links.html) as a heat solution. Put all the electronics in one room, and just run fiber to the I/O devices in another room. \* An interesting [observation on home storage](http://weblog.garyturner.net/archives/001740.html) -- gary asserts that home storage needs are surpassing busines storage needs. I guess this is not surprising, the video subsystem in PC is driven by consumer apps, not business apps, so why not storage? But gosh we need a consumer-friendly reliability and backup solution -- RAID and tapes aren't it. \* [Gigapixel cameras](http://wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,66498,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2) are coming. OK it sounds like you need a small team of scientists, a truckload of equipment, and some incredibly expensive optics, so I guess we won't see a Nikon Coolpix version soon. But hey that sounds like what it took initially to make a mainframe computer run and look where we are. Actually I don't care that much about gigapixel cameras -- but boy would I give an arm and a leg for gigapixel eyeglasses -- realtime zooming in on images miles away would be handy. \* Have to get a [Babble](http://www.hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/News/Story/0,1585,a4-c407-n350,00.html) when they are available -- _"In essence, Babble turns you into a small crowd--and changes how other people hear your voice," he added. "The result is that those outside your workspace cannot understand your actual spoken words."_ . I can't claim to need one but how cool. \* And this has nothing to do with PCs -- but I need this [weedburner](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000735.php). Why trim weeds when a flaming torch will do just as well? Actually this seems like a disaster in the making.
