I'm a founder of and partner at [Ignition Partners](http://www.ignitionpartners.com).  I'm on the board at [Judy's Book](http://www.judysbook.com) , [Pure Networks](http://www.purenetworks.com), and [Fat Spaniel](http://www.fatspaniel.com). I'm also a graduate student at [UW](http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/09/me_504_intro_to_mems.html) studying materials science.

Also the extended family is entangled with [The Overlake School](http://www.overlake.org) and [Prescott College](http://www.prescott.edu).

We support a variety of charities through the [Seattle Foundation](http://www.seattlefoundation.org).

My interests include books, hiking, extreme Halloween decorating, and college football.
