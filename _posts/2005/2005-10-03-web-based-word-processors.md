Man a flood of these -- [Writely](http://www.writely.com) (works well for me), [Jotlive](http://www.jotlive.com), [zohowriter](http://www.zohowriter.com), [writeboard](http://www.writeboard.com). Seems like the fullscale assault on ms-office scenarios is launching. Sure, office apps do like a kajillion more things, but I don't need all that, and the value of net-based storage and mobility outweighs it all. [Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com) and [web2.0central](http://web2.0central.com/) are great places to track these apps.
