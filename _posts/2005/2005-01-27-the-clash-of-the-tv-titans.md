\* First, read yesterday's (1/27/05) front page WSJ article on the struggle between comcast and the tv networks/producers to deliver on-demand versions of popular programs. Comcast wants to screw the networks/producers, the content owners want to protect their revenue streams, and so users are left with nothing -- or more exactly, users are pushed towards unfettered version of shows that leak out thru bittorrent or other means \* The networks are in an untenable position -- there is just no way to keep their content contained -- even if they have the fanciest drm in the world, at some point the tv signal gets rendered onto an rgb/composite/s-video feed so you can see it -- take look at [rgb.com](http://WWW.RGB.COM), you can pick up a box today that can capture 1600x1200, 25 frames per second, off a composite or rbg feed. I.E. there is no way to keep good digital copies from surfacing on the web. \* Meanwhile, Tivo is under increasing pressure -- and [it looks like consumers will be satisfied with DVRs from their tv provider](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/01/early_adopters_.html), rather than buy a Tivo. Too bad because the Tivo experience is way superior to other DVRs -- but the egos at Tivo and at the cable/satellite companies are destroying the Tivo business. \* And now Apple is crowding into the picture with the stylish Mac mini -- [pointer to Cringely](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/cringely_on_the.html), Steve Makofsky on [why people like the mini (and wondering why they don't like the PC in he same way)](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/the_mini_media_.html), [reviews of the Mac Mini](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9519). But there is no way to get a cable or satellite digital signal into a Mac Mini today -- the video providers are dead set against that happening as it creates another way for digital copies to leak onto the net -- so users lose out. Can Steve Jobs pull a rabbit out of his hat and solve this? \* And of course Microsoft continues to grind away with the Media Center PC. And I think all these front end boxes need a great back end media store in the home -- [something like this maybe?](http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/566/axentra_net-box_home)

Where will we all end up? Rich has some good thoughts about the [refactoring of the TV experience](http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/01/26/future_of_home_theater.html) -- and [some criticisms of everyone trying to create EPGs](http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/01/25/future_of_video.html). In the short term, Steve Makofsky points out that [we are headed for greater complexity and confusion as we have to learn about codecs and other software components.](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/01/are_codecs_the_.html)

Who is going to be the champion of the user, the friend of the user?
