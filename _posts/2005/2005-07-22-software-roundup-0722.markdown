\* Installed [Newsgator Outlook edition 2.5](http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=61). Seems faster and less resource consumptive. \* As [Mike](http://www.larkware.com/dg3/TheDailyGrind669.html) says, [Autoruns](http://www.sysinternals.com/utilities/autoruns.html) is a great tool, essential for monitoring what's on your system, amazing it is free. Mike also points to [XTM](http://www.warecase.com/), a replacement for windows task manager, might be useful. \* [Getoutfoxed](http://getoutfoxed.com/) -- one feature of this I love is the ability to enumerate and rate your running processes, and share this info with the community. A great way to do grass roots virus/spyware identification, not unlike the ideas behind [Cloudmark](http://www.cloudmark.com) \* [Fog Creek Copilot](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/07/15.html). Seems like a good feature to have as part of a future version of [NetworkMagic](http://www.networkmagic.com/) \* Rick Eames gave me this great tip [on how to automount network drives on my mac](http://www.bombich.com/mactips/automount.html) -- amazingly arcane. \* [Google toolbar for Firefox](http://toolbar.google.com/firefox/), finally. \* [Tipmonkies](http://www.tipmonkies.com/), lots of good software tidbits. Subscribed. \* [How to chkdsk your ipod](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToRunADiskScanchkdskfsckAndTroubleshootYourIPod.aspx ) -- great tip \* MSH (nee Monad) continues to intrique me -- [Monad and RSS](http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2005/06/monad_and_rss_p_1.html), [Monad and Yubnub](http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/MSHAndYubNubACommunityCommandline.aspx). Ihaven't had time to really play around with this as much as I should \* Oh and speaking of yubnub, [Phil adds yubnub support to berry411](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/07/yubnub-goes-mobile.html). Brilliant. \* Looking forward to [MT 3.2](http://www.betanews.com/article/Blog_Software_Fights_Comment_Spam/1121456004). Also might try some tagging plugins when I upgrade -- [MT tags plugin](http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4148), [MT and technorati](http://www.elise.com/mt/archives/001154technorati_tags_and_movable_type.php)
