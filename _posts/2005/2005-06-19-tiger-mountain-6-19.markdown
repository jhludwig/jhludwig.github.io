Hit [Tiger Mountain](http://www.attrition.ws/76/) this morning for a hike. It is a nice area and incredibly convenient -- maybe too convenient as it was quite crowded particularly at lower elevations, and the trails are pretty beat. But a gorgeous morning so I can't complain.

Here's [my good morning video](http://www.theludwigs,com/video/outdoors/GoodMorning.TigerMountain.061905.wmv) (3Meg), about 500 feet up from the trail head. And a little later on, on the backside of Tiger Mountain, [walking and thinking about doughnuts](http://www.theludwigs,com/video/outdoors/WalkingForDoughnuts.TigerMountain.061905.wmv) (7Meg), the logical conclusion of any hike.
