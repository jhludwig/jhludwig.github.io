\* As mentioned I love [rollyo](http://www.rollyo.com).  Just created a HalloweenPlans searchroll.  How do I link directly to this?  Not clear. \* Like Chris [I hate BetaPlace](http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2005/9/29/1269746.html).  It makes getting beta bits so hard, I just tend to give up. \* [Roundup of web-based productivity apps](http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/09/webbased_deskto.shtml).  I need a great XL and PPT replacement. \* An incredibly easy-to-use wiki continues to appeal to me.  [I'm not the only one](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2005/09/wikimania.html).  [People seem excited](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/27/jotspot-live-the-perfect-wiki/) about [jotlive](http://www.jotlive.com/) \* [Process Library](http://www.tipmonkies.com/2005/09/24/figure-out-what-those-windows-processes-do) -- another guide to all those damn things running on your machine.  I'm partial to [answers that work](http://www.answersthatwork.com/) but sometimes you have to triangulate \* [Netvibes seems really cool](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/09/netvibes_cool_p.html) -- i thought about creating a little ignition blog portal with it -- but it has problems with logins and remembering your content.  worth watching tho. \* [Swik](http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/09/28/swik_-_a_wiki_as_a_marketplace.html) from our friends at sourcelabs. Cool.
