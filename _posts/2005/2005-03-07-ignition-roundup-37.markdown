\* [Judy's Book](http://www.judysbook.com) is running [a survey on local schools](http://www.judysbook.com/survey4) -- give them a hand! \* More nice press for Jobster at [Seattle24x7](http://www.seattle24x7.com/up/up.htm) \* [Johnza on Salumi](http://www.zagula.com/food_and_wine/2005/03/04/salumi_wheres_the_beef.html) -- great great Seattle food establishment. \* [Martin found the collaborative symptomometer](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/03/the_collaborati.html) -- very cool seed of an idea. \* Rich found [this CPU decoder ring](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/03/03/cpu_decoder_ring.html) -- not clear it helps me know what to do, but a helpful resource. \* Adrian is [motivating me to upgrade to a Tivo2 box](http://www.geekfishing.net//2005/03/03/tivo_to_pc_transfer.html) -- I only wish the togo feature worked with macs. \* R[ich points towards StumbleUpon](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/internet/2005/02/28/stumbleupon.html) -- kind of cool, I do like to find random new web sites.
