OK as anyone who has mucked around with fog machines knows, it is hard to get the fog to lie low. You can buy fog chillers or build your own, plans abound on the web.

But here is [a simple solution on the MOM forums](http://www.methodzofmadness.com/php/smf/index.php?topic=1391.new#new) -- basically run your fog machine output through a pile of mulch. Apparently the temperature and moistness of the mulch cool the fog enough to keep it down. Good idea, I will try this year.
