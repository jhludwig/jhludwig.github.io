Finally feeling good enough to start tinkering again, and to blog about it.

I'm continuing my odyssey to attach every piece of technology I can to my [sharp aquous beast of a tv.](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001775.html) My Mac Mini arrived last week and I have it hooked up now to the DVI port. Looks great. The gotchas: Apple saves money by shipping the mini with no cables, so you have to go buy a DVI cable ($70 at least) and a stereo mini-jack cable (Aside -- why does Apple even bother putting a speaker in the mac mini???). 2nd gotcha -- the sharp defaults to an analog video signal from the pc, and you have to go wade thru the menus to force it to look for a digital signal -- seems like this could be auto-detected. The mini makes a great hometheater pc -- small, quiet, a fine dvd player. And I have bittorrent running on it to fill up the hard disk with tv content.

For additional fun I plugged a [kingston pcmcia hard drive](http://www.kingston.com/products/pccard.asp) into the pcmcia port on aquous. What a bizarre feature. I can play slide shows and videos off the pccard. Oh and I can take snapshots and video captures of the current signal, as long as it is from a crappy analog input -- analog coax, analog s-video. the tv won't capture the signal from a digital input or from the component inputs, probably to make the mpaa et al happy. So basically it is a really funky and limited DVR. Just goes to show again how much trouble Tivo is in -- it is trivial to slam DVR software into any box now, and storage is cheap.

I still have to fill up the hdmi and 1394 inputs...
