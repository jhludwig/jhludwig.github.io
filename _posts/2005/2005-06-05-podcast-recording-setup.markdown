Two recos on podcast recording setups:

\* [Rich's recos](http://www.tongfamily.com/internet/podcast/2005/05/28/podcast_recording_equipment.html) -- low end podcasting \* [Dan Bricklin's setup](http://danbricklin.com/log/2005_05_19.htm#podcastingsetup) -- higher end.

I haven't done a podcast yet, and well, it just needs to get way easier and simpler than this if I am ever going to. I can't see podcast creation ever becoming mainstream, certainly not at this level of complexity. Maybe if I could just talk to my cell to record a high quality podcast, i'd do it.
