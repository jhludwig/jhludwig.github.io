Latest [fanblog poll up](http://www.fanblogs.com/fanblogs_xiv/005643.php):

1\. Southern California (11) 167 2. Texas (1) 155 3. Ohio St. 126 4. Tennessee 108 5. LSU 97 6. Michigan 96 7. Virginia Tech 95 8. Iowa 83 9. Georgia 82 10. Florida 53 11. Florida St. 52 12. Louisville 46 13. Arizona St. 19 14. Notre Dame 18

OK I am biased but I think this poll is a lot more valid than the Coaches' or Writers' polls. The Fanblogs folks (me included) actually see a lot of these games, certainly we see way more than the Coaches do.
