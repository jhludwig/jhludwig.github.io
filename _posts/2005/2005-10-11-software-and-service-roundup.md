- [Web2.0 mashup matrix](http://www.programmableweb.com/matrix).  OK i don't really know what web2.0 is and I sure don't know that all the tools and services in this matrix make it any clearer -- but this is a way cool matrix of tools and services.  Found [elicit](http://www.theludwigs.com/2005/10/elicit_from_bingobangosoftware.html) via this matrix
- [PC Mag free software review](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/10/pc_magazines_fr.html).  Haven't read yet but usually some gems in here
- Tried out [copilot](http://www.copilot.com) over the weekend.  OK if you absolutely have no other way to remotely debug a machine, I guess this is OK.  And I admire their pricing model, it aligns exactly with users -- a daily fee that is not outrageous.  But this thing is so sssssslllllllooooowwwww.  Use the built-in RDP tools in XP if you can, they are much faster.
- [Myprogs.net](http://myprogs.net/) -- tagging applied to software.  Great way to find yet more crap to install on your system.
- Thread on [using greasemonkey to mine microformats](http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/10/greasemonkey_an.shtml) from web pages.  I watch this with anticipation.  Would be highly useful to be able to suck phone nums, addresses, events, etc from web pages.
- Phil on some new ambitious ajax apps -- [zimbro and meeba](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/10/zimbra-and-meebo/).  I don't think the vast majority of people here at ignition would mind if we moved to an ajax mail client.  Everyone already uses OWA from home/the road -- people rarely VPN in to use email anymore.  [Airset](http://www.tipmonkies.com/2005/10/05/airset-the-most-feature-filled-calendar-service-around) worth looking at too.
- [Free terabyte mail service](http://www.mailnation.net/).  Wow.
