Tom takes a break from his excellent series of posts on VOIP to [advocate for nuclear power](http://blog.tomevslin.com/2005/04/its_time_to_go_.html). Certainly my feeling as well, especially after reading [The Bottomless Well](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001827.html). We have the opportunity to make a significant switch away from fossil fuels over the next 30 years and we should grab the opportunity.
