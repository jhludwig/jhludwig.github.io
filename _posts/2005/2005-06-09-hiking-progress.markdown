I've done a good job since rededicating myself to exercise -- getting out on the trails 2 or 3 times a week. And I am still having fun.

On the downside, I fell and broke a rib Sunday. Ouch. Doesn't prevent me from hiking but quite painful. Basically a rookie mistake -- climbed onto a moss-covered fallen log and my feet flew out from under me. I have crappy instincts yet when it comes to the woodlands. As a kid I spent all my summers on the [rocky shores of georgian bay](http://www.pointeaubarilchamber.com/), and to this day I am pretty good at scrambling along rocky, slippery shorelines -- I have great instincts when it comes to mossy, slippery, unstable rocks. I have none of those instincts for woodlands terrain.
