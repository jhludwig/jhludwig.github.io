Back from two weeks of radio silence up on lopez island. Minor IT disasters on return -- 3 power strips blown at home (can't be a coincidence), one machine that forgot its hard disk config and was trying to boot off its 7200rpm data drive instead of the 10krpm raid0 array of system drives, and of course my web server had gone toes up for some reason (nothing in the logs??). All is well again.
