Boy this space seems to be heating up.  [RocketPost](http://www.anconia.com/rocketpost/) is doing great things as far as simple usability -- I've been trialing for a week and am really impressed with how easy it is to create links to websites, old posts, etc.

[Elicit](http://www.bingobangosoftware.com/) which I'm also trialing has a great calendaring interface and some neat ways to integrate commerce/affiliate programs.  And [Qumana](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/10/13/qumanas-simple-ad-inclusion-for-blogs/) looks like it is doing some cool stuff for ad insertion.

It is nice that we are moving past simple wysiwyg editting and really trying to make the blogger's life better.  Great innovation.
