Ok I watch way too much video -- broadcast tv, sports, dvds, tivo, bittorrent downloads. I like to think that a lot of it is inspiring, thought-provoking, inspirational, or at least well-produced.

But I do have some guilty pleasures. [Beauty and the geek](http://www.thewb.com/Shows/GenericShow/0,11116,228773,00.html) is great fun. Shallow babes and socially inept geeks, forced to help each other.

Even further in the gutter, [cheaters](http://www.cheaters.com/). Nothing like a surprise public confrontation of an adulterer for fun. And the smarmiest host on TV. Not to be missed.
