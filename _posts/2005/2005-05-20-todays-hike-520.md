Back to Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park (for the second time this week) for Today's hike. BTW, online maps for the park can be found at the [King County GIS Center](http://www.metrokc.gov/gis/vmc/Recreation.htm). Earlier this week we parked at the Anti-Aircraft Peak Trailhead, the Shangri-La trail from that point is a quite pretty tree-lined over-grown roadway, culminating in some huge lightly-treed bowls full of ferns and other ground cover -- gorgeous. The trail leads steadily down so you'll have a bit of a walk back to the trailhead.

This morning started at the Wilderness Creek Trailhead on the SE side of the park. A relative low point, the trail from here is a great cardio workout, steadily up with a lot of switchbacks. I ran out of time and didn't quite make it to the top of Wildnerness Peak, you should be able to get from trailhead to top in an hour or hour and 15 minutes.

Next up: I think I'll try the neighboring Squak Mountain trails.
