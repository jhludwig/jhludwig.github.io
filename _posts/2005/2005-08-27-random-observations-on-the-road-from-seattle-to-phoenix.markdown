\* What is up with the speed limits in Oregon? Vast stretches of empty country in the eastern part of the state, and speed limits set at 65. No other state in the west is stuck back at this level. \* I didn't expect the bars in Salt Lake City to be so rockin' on a Saturday night. They are wilder than Seattle bars. \* Littering is illegal, but trucks are allowed to leave huge horking pieces of blown tires all over the highway? \* The security at the parking garage at the Bellagio in LV was tighter than the security for driving over Hoover Dam. \* Prescott is a very nice town. Has to be my favorite spot in Arizona so far. The granite dells are beautiful. \* Phoenix on the other hand -- LA, only hotter and without the ocean.
