Good article about [Teach for America](http://www.teachforamerica.org/flash_movie.html) in nyt this weekend. I didn't know anything about the program.

> _Teach For America is the national corps of outstanding recent college graduates of all academic majors who commit two years to teach in urban and rural public schools, and become lifelong leaders in the effort to expand educational opportunity. Our mission is to build the movement to eliminate educational inequity by enlisting some of our nation's most promising future leaders in the effort._

Inspiring.
