Apparently my use of my blackberry to get sports scores must border on the fanatic as my usage made the [WSJ](http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB113392267580515883-lMyQjAxMDE1MzAzOTkwMjkyWj.html), as also noted in the [Seattle PI](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/archives/100765.asp) (with some empathy as John Cook is also a buckeye fan).

I need to stand up for myself a little bit tho. My "check scores 40 times during a game" estimate was just a quick estimate by me, and is probably way off. In actuality if it is a game I care about, I check the play by play results every minute, so a realistic estimate is more like 100-200 times a game. I know, pathetic.

I bet I am not alone tho. I wonder why no one has done an ass-kicking mobile app to track baseball, football, basketball play by play.
