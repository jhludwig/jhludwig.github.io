\* [Senseo coffee maker](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0001ES9FS/ref=wl_it_dp/103-3255269-2891047?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=IW6B8GBISB10&v=glance&colid=HOUS82ICZY78). This appears to the best rated single serve machine. \* Nightvision binoculars. I have no idea what is really the best deal in this space. \* Handheld GPS with topo/trail maps. Not sure what the right unit us. [REI](http://www.rei.com) has lots of choices. UPDATE: Jeff Ort of [sourcelabs](http://www.sourcelabs.com) has had good experiences with the [Garmin eTrex Vista](http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexVista/) and would recommend the Garmin line.
