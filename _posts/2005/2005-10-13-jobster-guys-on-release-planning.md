[Phil points](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/10/alan-steele-on-priorities-idleness-and-innovation/) to [Alan Steele](http://www.drizzle.com/~asteele/2005/10/priorities-idleness-and-innovation.html):

_Imagine the situation in which the release bucket is actually half-empty of features, that there is actually "spare time" in the release. … what would you do?_

_Naturally, you'd scramble to fill the release bucket with enough work from the 1700 programmer-decade queue to keep those developers busy for the next little while. Wrong. The correct answer is: Do Nothing. A half-empty release bucket is a golden opportunity for innovation…._
