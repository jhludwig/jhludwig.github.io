\* From [Geekman](http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Netcool.html), [broadcast machine](http://www.participatoryculture.org/bm/) \-- become your own bittorrent/video publisher. \* Rich has a [little roundup of CDR tools](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/05/15/cdr_tools.html) \* [Steve isn't a fan of rss reading inside your mail client](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/05/rss_is_not_emai.html) -- I am different, I love [newsgator](http://www.newsgator.com), the way I read email and feeds are very similar. \* [Firefox 1.04 released](http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20050512_firefox_104_released.phtml) -- increasingly putting the lie to the belief that Firefox is inherently more secure than IE. Security threats rise with popularity. \* [A comment on my earlier post about what I want from Longhorn](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/05/what_john_wants.html) -- some good points. But I differ on the view that some of the problems are the hardware manufacturers' issues. MSFT has created the PC industry, MSFT sucks up most of the net profits, MSFT has to own the problems. \* Also from Steve, a teeny wiki -- [GTDTiddlyWiki](http://shared.snapgrid.com/gtd_tiddlywiki.html). I have to play with this. This thing is fascinating. \* [AIM Mail](http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20050511_aim_mail_aol_jumps_on_the_2gig_webmail_bandwagon.phtml) -- now you get a 2GB email account with AIM. This seems like it will be huge. Boy the install bites tho, feels like your browser is getting slammed with so much crap. And this AOL Browser thing is just strange, some hack of IE. \* [Clay Shirky on ontologies](http://shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html) -- nice discussion, relevant for people thinking about tagging. One of the core points is dead on -- tags shouldn't not be binary systems but probabilistic systems. \* [IEEE Computer Society RSS Feeds](http://www.windley.com/archives/2005/05/ieee_computer_r.shtml). Need to sub to these. \* Phil Bogle [on roaming browser state](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/05/roaming-browser-state.html). Gosh I wish I had a firefox plugin that would export a list of installed plugins, and then auto install this list on another machine. \* Some good dhtml ideas in here -- [crazy-good dhtml](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/05/11/CrazyGoodDHTML.html)
