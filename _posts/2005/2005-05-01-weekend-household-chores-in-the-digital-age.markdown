\* Install Tiger on Mac Mini. painless. \* Rip latest CD purchases. \* Update ipods \* Install and tune surround sound system in game room \* download last 5 alias episodes using bitcomet. (lest you think i am a rampant pirate -- i pay directv for satellite service, i pay comcast for hdtv service, we've purchased alias seasons 1, 2, and 3 on dvd. i am paying to watch alias every freakin' way the industry will let me pay, so i don't need to hear any crap about my downloads. give me a legal way to pay for HD alias downloads and I'll pay for that too.)

Someone from 100 years ago would find my chore list to be incomprehensible.
