\* Would love to deploy [digital door locks](http://www.thegadgethome.com/) but they just don't match any of our hardware. My car has keyless entry now, so I am frustrated that the house does not. \* This [hard-fi thing](http://www.gadgets-weblog.com/50226711/hardfi_transfering_music_easier.php) seems like vaporware but could be cool. I definitely would buy something that shortcuts the path from CD to ipod. \* [Netgear's home nas](http://www.netgear.com/products/details/SC101.php) -- i used to have a little snap nas -- it didn't last long and had perf issues. but maybe worth trying again. \* Wonder how the [slingbox](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/06/slingbox_offici.html) is selling. \* Picked up these [altec lansing speakers](http://www.alteclansing.com/product_details.asp?pID=XT1) last month and have been happy \* not a product but [hackaday](http://www.hackaday.com/) is a fun site for hardware projects
