OK this guy spammed me with his blog articles but they turned out to be pretty interesting -- [Your Idea Isn't Good Enough To Keep Secret](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/archives/2005/10/your_idea_isnt.html), [The Myth Of The Great Idea](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/archives/2005/10/the_myth_of_the.html).  Good stuff.  I've always been puzzled by entrepreneurs who aren't willing to be open with their ideas.  The smart guys I know are generally very open, they have new ideas every day, they know they can give away their ideas because they will always have new ones.  And they know it is all about execution, not ideas.
