From [my latest reco on Judy's book](http://members.judysbook.com/posts/content/review.aspx?ci=4017) -- _"We used [Cascade](http://www.cascademovinginc.com/index.html) to do a small move from our house to Lopez Island and they were great. Showed up on time, friendly solicitous staff from quote through the move, unpacked everything carefully. I would use again for any local move."_
