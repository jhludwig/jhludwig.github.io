OK now that I am off the high of the Michigan game, what's next? Let's assume enough of the BCS top 6 win out, ie there is no way for The OSU to jump to the #2 position. [Si.COM says OSU will get left out of the BCS mix, pushed out by Oregon and ND](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/stewart_mandel/11/21/bowl.projections/index.html) -- the claim being that the Fiesta Bowl holds all the cards and that they may be tired of The OSU.

After a [careful reading of the BCS selection rules](http://www.bcsfootball.org/index2.cfm?page=eligibility), I don't get it. The Fiesta loses Texas to the Rose and so they get first pick to replace. They can pick any BCS eligible team. I think the game is all about avoiding WVU as they are the worst TV draw. So the Fiesta can pick Penn State as their first team. Then they have to list 3 choices for their second team, and WVU as a conf champ has to be at least their #2 pick. And the Orange wins tiebreakers, so assuming both the Orange and the Fiesta choose ND as their first choice, the Fiesta gets WVU (or even worse, USF!!).

Alternatively, the Fiesta could pick ND as their first team, and then they have to list Penn State and WVU as their top two choices in their list of three. Again they lose the tiebreaker to the Orange and end up with WVU.

Either way it seems like the Sugar ends up with the last choice and (assuming The OSU falls this far) will get to pick between The OSU or Oregon. And it has been a while since The OSU has been to the Sugar.
