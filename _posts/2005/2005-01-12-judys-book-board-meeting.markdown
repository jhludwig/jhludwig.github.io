Had our board meeting today. Man I have to say I like our board. Chris (and Ted) from [Ackerley Partners](http://www.ackerley.com/) are great guys with domain experience that is so different than ours, and very complementary. I admire [Jerry Colonna](http://madeleines.typepad.com/madelines/) hugely, his openness and honesty on his blog are inspiring. And of courze the management team at Judy's Book is awesome, Andy and Chris are rock solid. Very inspiring group, very inspiring discussion.
