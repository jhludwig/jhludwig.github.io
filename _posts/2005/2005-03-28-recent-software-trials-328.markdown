Tried and liked:

\* [CustomizeGoogle](http://www.customizegoogle.com/) via [Larkware](http://www.larkware.com/dg2/TheDailyGrind585.html). And the required greasemonkey addon to firefox is great. \* [Firefox search plugins](http://www.movalog.com/archives/general/firefox-search-plugins.php). I had no idea you could add these in. Cool. How do I create my own? \* After months of footdragging, finally installed [this gmail shell extension](http://www.viksoe.dk/code/gmail.htm). Very cool. \* [JimH's rumour city.](http://www.jimhblog.com/jimhblog/2005/03/start_a_rumor_a.html) Loved the ancestor of this toy back in WFW days... \* [Power Supply Wattage Calculator](http://www.jscustompcs.com/power_supply/) via [Pirillo](http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2005/3/11/424561.html). I'll never build a PC without it again.

Meaning to try:

\* [Essential Mac Softwar](http://www.furrygoat.com/2005/03/essential_mac_s.html)e now that I have a mini. \* [ipodder](http://ipodder.sourceforge.net/index.php). i'm so late to this game. \* [Olivelink](http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/715/olivelink_personal_media). downloading beta now. \* [Never miss an episode with rss and bittorrent](http://pealco.net/archives/2004/11/08/how_to_never_miss_an_episode_with_bittorrent_and_rss). i'm still bittorrenting the old-fashioned way. \* [naslite](http://www.ehomeupgrade.com/entry/659/review_naslite+_v1). Lightweight nas software for the home/office. \* [picasa 2](http://www.picasa.com/). I'm kind of burnt out on photo software -- none of the packages ever seem to really help me that much. But i should try again. \* divx codecs. Actually i already have some variant of these, just a reminder here where to look for them -- http://www.divx.com/divx/download/, http://www.divx-difest.com/software/xvid.html
