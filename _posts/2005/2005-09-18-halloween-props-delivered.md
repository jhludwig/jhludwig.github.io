[Door to Door](http://www.doortodoor.com/) delivered my two containers over the weekend. I'm about 75% unpacked -- props and gear tucked away all around the house and yard. I'm waiting for the year that my storage containers are broken into and the would-be thieves stumble across a pile of skeletons -- I am sure the police will show up looking for a serial killer.

[Door to Door](http://www.doortodoor.com/) has provided reliable service over the last 3 years but delivery was kind of squirelly this time. They didn't show on the scheduled day, were very very hard to get on the phone, and claimed that they had left messages at home and on my cell because they needed to confirm the delivery address (they never called my cell, they called home once and didn't leave a message). We finally got it worked out but I may try [shurguard](http://www.shurgard.com/public/) this year.
