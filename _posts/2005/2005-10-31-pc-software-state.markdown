[Phil on tagging and search history](http://thebogles.com/blog/2005/10/tagging-and-search-history-in-the-google-toolbar-coming-soon/) -- _"The race is on to push more and more browser state out into the cloud from the PC, and to more seamlessly blur browsing, tagging, and authoring."_

It shouldn't be just browser state. All PC state should be moving into the cloud. Increasingly this is one of the top criteria I use to eval software.
