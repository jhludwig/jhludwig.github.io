- [Heathkit Virtual Museum | A Tribute to Heathkits](http://www.heathkit-museum.com/).  Loved this stuff as a kid tho I was an incompetent welder/assembler.  But I drooled over the catalog.  via [Make](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/08/heathkit_virtual_museum.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890)
- [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/).  Pretty cool personal 3D fab site.  The creator app is awesome
