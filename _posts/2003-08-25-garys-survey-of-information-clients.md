Gary is doing a little survey of information clients -- [Gary Burd: Information clients](http://gary.burd.info/space/entry-72.html "Gary Burd: Information clients"). Very interesting space -- I've mentioned in the past that [my blog is becoming in some ways my pim](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000035.html), i would love to be able to do more pim-like things in my blog, and be able to pull in and export more sets of data. I really want a server side solution, and some of these codebases might work. I certainly need a much better security model tho if I am to start putting more personal data up on the blog.
