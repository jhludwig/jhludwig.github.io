[Nokia's Lifeblog](http://www.engadget.com/entry/8391854652128497/ "Nokiaâ€™s Lifeblog - Engadget - www.engadget.com"), [Microsoft's Sensecam](http://www.engadget.com/entry/2488485527327140/), Gordon Bell's [MyLifeBits](http://research.microsoft.com/barc/mediapresence/MyLifeBits.aspx), some [CMU students blogging](http://www.celticknot.net/miLife/) a lot of the activity -- lots of early thinking happening about recording your entire life. And a couple thousand startups focused on the most trivial first implementation, moblogs. I don't see that many companies focused on the longer term vision tho.
