I don't understand how the music industry is going to evolve, but I sure love artists that are attempting experiments and not just sitting back and letting the RIAA lob bombs at everyone.

Kudos to [Prince for his own music store](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/29/technology/29prince.html?ex=1395896400&en=20da5cbf305c1027&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND), I loved his original body of work and am going to have to give him a try again.

And kudos to Jay-Z I think -- the [Jay-Z construction set](http://www.jayzconstructionset.com/) is totally cool, allows users to build their own mixes. I'm not sure if Jay-Z actually sanctions this work, maybe he hates it. But letting users interact more deeply with the music seems like a great way to add value to music and thereby encourage people to buy it.
