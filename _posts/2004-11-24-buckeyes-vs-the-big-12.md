Wow I didn't know the Buckeyes were so dominant..._"Ohio State is 26-3-1 against Big 12 teams and 4-0 against the Big 12 in bowl games. OSU defeated Oklahoma in the 1977 Cotton Bowl, Texas A &M in the 1987 Cotton and 1998 Sugar Bowls and Kansas State in the 2004 Fiesta Bowl."_...from [the Dispatch](http://www.dispatch.com/football/football.php?story=dispatch/2004/11/24/20041124-F1-02.html) (sub reqd).
