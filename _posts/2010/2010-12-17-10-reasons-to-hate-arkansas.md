I don't really have any feelings good or bad about Arkansas, but of course now that they are the Buckeyes' next opponent, I have to foster a deep hatred of all things Arkansas. Here's a quick list:

\# Walmart. Destroying the retail economies of small towns all over America, while sending jobs to China. # Philandering ex-president. And if you are going to be a philanderer, at least do it well. "Ohio's philandering president":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren\_G.\_Harding was a much better philanderer, actually having a child out of wedlock. # Philandering president's wife. Hilary stood by her man and swallowed her pride. "Harding's wife probably poisoned him":http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists\_spies/assassins/warren\_harding/6.html. I know who I want with me in a fight. # The name means "land of downriver people":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas as in "Don't drink the water there, the Midwest has been dumping its crap in the rivers forever and letting it flow downstream". # Ryan Mallett. Once a Michigan man, always a Michigan man. The taint of Michigan will doom him. # No MLB, NFL, NBA teams in the state. Hardly qualifies as a state. # Arkansas's favorite son, Scottie Pippen, Jordan's bag carrier. # The name, again. Most of it stolen from Kansas. And can't be bothered to say the last letter -- do they think this is France? # S-E-C! I'm sure Arkansas fans will trot this out, but remind them: Arkansas has been getting waxed by the same SEC leaders for years... # Arkansas in name only. The majority of the "roster":http://www.arkansasrazorbacks.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB\_OEM\_ID=6100&SPID=2419&SPSID=30724 is from other states. This is basically an indictment of the quality of football player in Arkansas. The team is really the Texas/Louisiana/Georgia/Oklahoma/Alabama/Florida Razorbacks.
