OK, this thing seems a little laggy, and doesn't seem to love Spaces, but the promise of "Air Display":http://avatron.com/apps/air-display/ is freaking phenomenal. The iPad makes a GREAT auxiliary display for my MacBook. Guys, hammer on the performance and on Spaces integration. This app also somehow seems related to all the remote desktop apps, there is some smart integration work to do there as well -- like I should be able to drag windows to my iPad, and then walk away with the iPad, and have it start up a remote desktop session so that I can still use that window remotely.

But a great start.
