Taking Finite Element Analysis this term which would be way easier if I actually had ever taken a basic course in mechanical engineering. Beams, trusses, springs, cantilevers are all foreign to me, I was learning about resistors and capacitors when the MechEs were learning this stuff.

Web to the rescue: \* "Cantilever calculator":http://www.efunda.com/formulae/solid\_mechanics/beams/casestudy\_display.cfm?case=cantilever\_endload#target up at efunda. \* "Moments of Inertia":http://www.efunda.com/math/areas/IndexArea.cfm and other basics for beams of any shape \* A ton of other basic calculations up here as well: "efunda engineering calculations":http://www.efunda.com/formulae/formula\_index.cfm \* Of course Wolfram Alpha has a wealth of info as well.

Just starting to look thru iphone and ipad apps as well. Wolfram ALpha I already have, there are several civil enginnering apps as well -- Statics, Civil Engineering Calculations. May try some of them.
