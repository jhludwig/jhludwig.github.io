So I am starting to read a new book on my Kindle and just after the Library of Congress info I see that:

"The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the American National Standard for Information Sciences--Permanence of Paper for Printed Library Materials, ANSI Z39.48-1992."

Good to know.
