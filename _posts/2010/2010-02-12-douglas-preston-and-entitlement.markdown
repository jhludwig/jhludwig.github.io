"Preston is exhibiting that he knows deeply what it means to feel 'entitlement'":http://chamberfour.com/2010/02/11/on-the-word-entitlement/. My reaction when I read Preston's quote was exactly the same as this writer. Fortunately his books are throw-away fluff, and not even good throw-away fluff, so I will miss nothing if I never buy one again.
