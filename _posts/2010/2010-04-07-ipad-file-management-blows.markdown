> For all the great things on the iPad, file management is currently a disaster. I've got two different apps that can connect to my ftp server and my iDisk, but neither one can get the downloaded documents to Pages or iAnnotate. I have to use iwork.com to get files into Pages, and the desktop app for iAnnotate. If we can't have a complete Finder on the iPad, we at least need a set of common folders that can be shared between applications.

Boy is this dead right. I can use Safari/Web Of Science or Papers on the iPad to find journal papers, but I can't download them to the iPad and then use them with iAnnotate -- I have to go to my desktop, download them, and sync them. I can comment on papers with iAnnotate, but I can't important the comments into a Pages doc -- I have to sync the annotated PDF back to the desktop, copy comments over to a doc, and then sync that back with iTunes to edit on the iPad with Pages. Geez even MS-DOS 1.0 had shared file storage.

This is way more important to me than multitasking. And in fact, I'm not even sure I care about multitasking without this.
