The great thing about living in the gadget and cloud age is the huge explosion of procrastination aids available to me. Yesterday was my uncle's birthday so I better send him a message on "Facebook":www.fac,ebook.com, oh and I wonder if my own birthday wishlist is up to date on "Amazon":http://www.amazon.com/wishlist/HOUS82ICZY78, and boy howdy do my "Amazon recommendations":https://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/iyr?ie=UTF8&ref\_=sv\_ys\_3 suck, so I better tune those up, and I wonder what my friends are recommending on "Goodreads":www.goodreads.com, and maybe I should install the [Goodreads iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreads/id355833469?mt=8), oh and check out some other "top selling iPhone apps":http://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/paid-apps/, I can certainly use Fruit Ninja and FatBooth. Oh of course I got the "iOS4.0 release":http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/ installed on the iPhone, which also drug on the new version of iTunes, speaking of which I really need to update my playlists, oh and I better install all these other updates on my Mac, and hey I got some new RAW support for Aperture, and I've been needing to upload some photos from Aperture to "Smugmug":www.smugmug.com, and is my "BackBlaze":www.backblaze.com backup working ok? And maybe I should try "Lightroom":http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/ instead of Aperture, Lightroom has some "cool plugins":http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/plugins/, though the "Aperture Plugins":http://www.apple.com/aperture/resources/plugins.html are cool too, and I have to update my "Firefox":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:7 and "Chrome":http://www.chromeplugins.org/ and "Wordpress plugins":http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/, there are sure some nice "Twitter":www.twitter.com plugins for Wordpress, and maybe I should check my Twitter feed. And my email. And my facebook stream. And my rss subscriptions. Man it has been a full day and I've yet to check in on college football websites, halloween forums, haven't posted any blog content, but I better take a "DoodleJump":http://itunes.apple.com/app/doodle-jump-be-warned-insanely/id307727765?mt=8 break first. Though I wonder if I have any game updates on "Steam":http://store.steampowered.com/ and my two "Kindles":http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation/dp/B0015T963C are out of sync with each other and I have some photos I've been meaning to scan in and I want to check the Tivo todo list to make sure I am getting "Louie":http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/louie/...
