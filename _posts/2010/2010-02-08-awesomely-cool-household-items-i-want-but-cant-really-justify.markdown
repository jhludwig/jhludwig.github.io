\* "Magimix Vision Toaster":http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2010/01/magimix\_vision.php. Our current toaster works just fine but this one just looks so awesome. \* "Wood Alarm Clock":http://okthestore.com/gallery.php?id=73. I hate your typical alarm clock, this is pretty atypical. \* "Magisso Cake Server":http://design-milk.com/magisso-cake-server/?utm\_source=feedburner&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=Feed%3A+design-milk+%28Design+Milk%29&utm\_content=Google+Reader. Don't make that many cakes but this is a reason to start. \* "Shattered Glass Table":http://blabitalia.com/en/products/b-glass/impact/ is awesome looking. Sign me up. \* "Suitcase Chairs":http://design-milk.com/suitcase-chairs-by-katie-thompson/?utm\_source=feedburner&utm\_medium=Google+Reader&utm\_campaign=Feed%3A+design-milk+%28Design+Milk%29&utm\_content=Google+Reader. Don't love this color but love the idea. \* "Found lumber staircase":http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2010/01/gelitin\_palais.php?utm\_source=feedburner&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=Feed%3A+ch+%28Cool+Hunting%29&utm\_content=Google+Reader. There is something about this I love. \* "Canisters":http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2010/01/airscape\_airtig.php. Ok what I really want is the indestructible French press mentioned. \* "Glass pendant lamp":http://www.scandinaviandesigncenter.com/Products/usd0/Trademark/New+products/10627/One+pendant&VariantId=02&Image=img2. Dust will make me regret this but it looks awesome \* "Canvas Clock":http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20100207/real-tim-canvas-clock-shows-current-time/. I think everyone else in the household might barf on this one. \* "Flask salt/pepper shakers":http://www.modestudio.co.uk/products-mode-earl-salt-and-pepper.php?g=earl. No idea if functional, but nice looking.
