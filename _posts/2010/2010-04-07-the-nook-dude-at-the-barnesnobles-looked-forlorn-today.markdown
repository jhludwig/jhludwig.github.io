How bad would it be to be a Nook pusher right now? The Kindle has its adherents, the iPad is out there, why would anyone buy a Nook? I have to think that B&N is going to bail on this strategy at some point.

Amazon on the other hand I think is playing its hand well. At the end of the day, I doubt that Amazon cares that much about maintaining control over the Kindle hardware -- it was just a vehicle for jumpstarting ebook sales. If people prefer to consume ebooks on phones or iPads or PCs or whatever, Amazon is there with the Kindle software and nice sync'ing of state across all your bookreading devices. I'd expect to see them continue to invest in the software and service asset, and it wouldn't shock me if they sold the Kindle asset to some hardware company at some point.

Apple faces an interesting conundrum -- why would you buy a book in the Apple store which can only be read on the iPad, when you could just as easily buy it in the Kindle store and read it in a dozen places?

Another thought -- so many people look at the Kindle vs iPad battle as if it is some head-to-head winner-take-all cagematch. In fact tho, as the cost of electronics keeps driving down to zero, I'd suspect that rather than one unified device in my bag, I'll have many smart devices all sync'ing to shared data in the cloud. Magazines, books, and newspapers all coexisted just fine in the old world, I carried them all in my bag. No reason why I won't carry several different smart devices in my bag with different form factors and benefits. As long as they all sync data to the cloud, I'll be happy (again, nice job Amazon).
