\* "Rechargeable battery recos":http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2010/09/battery-geek/. Rich overbrains rechargeable battery selecting. \* "Rich on cables":http://www.tongfamily.com/archives/2010/04/cables-and-cables/. Good tip on where to buy cheap cables. Amazon cable pricing is pretty good too. Best Buy is ridiculous, someone should go to jail for Best Buy cable pricing. Always better to stop at Radio Shack first for emergency cable needs, tho their pricing is not fantabulous either.

Rich, please advise on shredders next.
