\* "Typhoon":amazon by Charles Cumming. I really liked this tale, suspense set in China over the last 15 years, with some nicely shaded characters. Amazon says just 3.5 stars, but I'm at least 4 stars, I would pick up another book by the author in a heartbeat. \* "Invisible":amazon by Paul Auster. Quite a twisted little tale of a very evil and manipulative man working his way through a set of lives. And a very nice structure to the tale, raises the book above your typical mystery. I've had several Austers on the shelf for a while, very worth the time. Amazon says 4 stars, I'm good with that. \* "The Private Patient":amazon by P.D. James. This one feels to me like it is the dead zone between a good mystery yarn and literature. The author aspires to write a deeper more thoughtful tale but is just boring. Doubt I will finish. Amazon says 4 stars but really not close.
