\* "EMP cannon":http://www.physorg.com/news183296601.html. Mount one of these babies on your trunk and eliminate that tailgating problem. \* "Shock Cannon":http://www.physorg.com/news183142646.html and here is how to get that solicitor off your porch. \* "Vortex Cannon video":http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/07/gas-powered\_vortex\_cannon\_as\_big\_ba.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890. Probably a bit more powerful than I ever thought about building at Halloween.
