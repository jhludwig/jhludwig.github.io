\* Firefox is feeling increasingly bloated, maybe because I've got a bunch of plugins jammed in. But trying out "Camino":http://db.tidbits.com/article/11548?rss&utm\_source=feedburner&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=Feed%3A+tidbits\_main+(TidBITS%3A+Mac+News+for+the+Rest+of+Us)&utm\_content=Google+Reader on the Mac, seems cleaner and lighter. \* "Shuffler.FM":www.shuffler.fm. Eh, streaming music just doesn't work for me. My primary listening time is while driving and I need music that I can put on an ipod or cd. When I am at an actual computer I am too busy doing other things. But I like music discovery tools and guides, I just don't want them bound into streaming. \* "GIT for the lazy":http://www.spheredev.org/wiki/Git\_for\_the\_lazy. Perfect for me. \* "Terminal tips and tricks for OSX":http://superuser.com/questions/52483/terminal-tips-and-tricks-for-mac-os-x and in general SuperUser seems helpful. \* I want to love "WiseStamp":http://www.wisestamp.com/ but I don't get email addins that assume you are only sending email from a browser. iPhone? iPad? OSX Mail? How can I commit to this thing if I can't use it consistently? Sigh. \* I'm super late to "Windows Live Sync":https://sync.live.com/home.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0 but it is very useful. I do have a quibble with the naming, once upon a time MSFT was confident enough in its products to give them simple iconic names -- Word, Excel, Windows. The company seems to have lost its confidence in products and jams these crazy names on them to try to ride on the coattails of other products. Mistake.
