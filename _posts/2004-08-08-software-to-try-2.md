Noted in various pc mags:

\* [Zoot software](http://www.zootsoftware.com/). Talks on the website about pairing with outllook and newsgator to handle rss feeds -- which is my rss config. \* [File Viewer](http://www.clear-simple.com). Apparently a good way to browse/view files. \* [ThumbsPlus](http://www.cerious.com). Supposedly handles RAW files better than most photo viewers.
