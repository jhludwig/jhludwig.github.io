- [wow, no thank you.](https://www.amazon.com/Wow-No-Thank-You-Essays-ebook/dp/B07W3J49XM) by Samantha Irby. The title is exactly the reaction I had, couldn't finish. Just didn't relate to anything in here, I may not be the target audience. It does have a cute bunny on the cover.
- [Sunburst and Luminary](https://www.amazon.com/Don-Eyles-ebook/dp/B07L9YQ9WV/) by Don Eyles. Fascinating story inside the Apollo program, great depth on the software and compute environment. Most people will find this book a little too in the software weeds but I enjoyed it.
- [The World of Tomorrow](https://www.amazon.com/World-Tomorrow-Brendan-Mathews-ebook/dp/B01MT5299R) by Brendan Mathews. Great story of three brothers in New York in the years before WWII, all working their schemes. Great characters.
- [Algorithms to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-to-Live-By-audiobook/dp/B01D24NAL6) by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. I wanted to like this book but it felt soulless. Ultimately I gave up, it didn't seem to teach me anything I wanted to learn about human relations.
