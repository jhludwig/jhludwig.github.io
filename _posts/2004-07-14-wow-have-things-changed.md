You leave the country for 5 weeks and everything is turned upside down when you return.

We have a [new nickel](http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/index.cfm?flash=yes&action=nickel_series "The United States Mint"). A new [coke](http://www.cokec2.com/home.html). And our [trash collection day has been moved](http://www.rabanco.com/) to Wednesday.

It's like coming back to a freakin' foreign country.
