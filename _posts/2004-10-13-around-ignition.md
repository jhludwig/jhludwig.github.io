\* Rich and John have [revved the marketing playbook site](http://marketingplaybook.com/2004/10/08/new_site_design.html) -- looks nice to me \* Andy is [looking for help at Judy's Book](http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2004/10/recruiting_in_s.html) \* Rich analyzes what's going on with [small speakers](http://marketingplaybook.com/2004/10/13/portable_speakers.html) -- everyone is climbing all over everyone else in an attempt to bind themselves to the iPod success. \* Andy is thinking about [how to make Judy's Book indispensable](http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2004/10/indispensable.html) -- great point -- people don't have time these days for products that are just nice to have -- they only have time for products that are critical to their life.

OK there are other things going on as well but these are what caught my eye.
