[Caltech researchers awarded $10M for molecular programming project](http://www.physorg.com/news138295921.html). UW involved as well.Â  More info at [the Molecular Programming Project](http://www.ist.caltech.edu/mpp/):

> ...we will develop new computer science principles for programming information-bearing molecules like DNA and RNA to create artificial biomolecular programs of similar complexity.
> 
> ...computing and decision-making will carried out by chemical processes themselves. Through the creation of molecular programming languages, theory for analyzing them, and experiments for validating them, our long-term vision is to establish "molecular programming" as a subdiscipline of computer science

Fascinating stuff.
