[Gstreamer](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) continues to be super useful, although like every open source project, there are a lot of rough edges. [Open Frameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) seems like it might be very useful as well. [FPM](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) -- effing package management, indeed. [io.js](https://github.com/iojs/io.js) -- wondering if I should jump to, the recent slowness of node.js revs is cause for wonder.
