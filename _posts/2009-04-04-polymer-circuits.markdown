Good basic article on [polymer circuits](www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~kphang/ece1371/polymer.pdf). I need to learn more about charge transport in polymers, i have a basic understanding of charge transport in metals and semiconductors and ionic fluids, i don't really understand polymers. Polymer circuits potentially a research area for my future course work.
