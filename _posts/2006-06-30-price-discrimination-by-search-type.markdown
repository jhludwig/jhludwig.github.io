Clever bastards -- _[Ross Parker has discovered that on at least one website prices differ depending on how you ask your search to be ordered. In particular, if you ask for prices to be listed from lowest to highest you get lower prices, on exactly the same hotels, than when you ask for highest to lowest prices](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/06/price_discrimin.html)._
