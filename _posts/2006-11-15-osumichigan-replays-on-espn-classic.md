In case you need help getting in the mood, [ESPNtv.com - ESPN Classic](http://sports.espn.go.com/espntv/espnNetwork?networkID=18 "ESPNtv.com - ESPN Classic") is showing past games daily, as well as one hour summaries of key games. I saw parts of the '69 loss again, damn we should have won that. And parts of the 74 12-10 OSU win.
