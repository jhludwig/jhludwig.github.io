**Halloween Preps**. After much deliberation I've settled on my projects for this year. I am a) going to beef up my lightning primarily by switching to blue photo floodlights as discussed on [my halloween blog](http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html). B) I am going to try my hand at a small axworthy ghost project, drawing inspiration from some of the more [](http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/urmyslav/page1.html?mtbrand=AOL_US)extreme setups out there. I've tracked down a motor and am going to start laying out all the gear i need this weekend. c) i am going to build a small [flying lantern](http://members.accesstoledo.com/kkrazykkaren/Floating/Lantern.html) setup. i've also gotten my cheap mirror ball motor for this and am going to start getting the rest of the gear this weekend.

There are some minor other things I want to do but these are the longer leadtime items. I'll try to post pictures as I make progress.
