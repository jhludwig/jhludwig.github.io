OK OK, Pryor has made some ill-considered comments this week, but he is not alone. [MOTSAG](http://menofthescarletandgray.com/2009/09/09/fill-in-the-blank/) has these choice words from Matt Barkley:

Among other things, Barkley was asked by a reporter on the field what he had learned about himself as a quarterback.

"That this is fun. This is easy. This is what I was made to do," Barkley said.

I asked Barkley if there was anything that was difficult.

"The run up the tunnel at halftime," he said. "That was brutal."

Perhaps the Buckeyes can provide him some lessons in humility on Saturday. All in the name of helping his further development as a person.
