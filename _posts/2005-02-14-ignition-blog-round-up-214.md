I'm way behind and so missed a lot of good stuff. But a few things I noticed on Ignition blogs (or blog posts about Ignition or its portfolio)...

\* Rich is tracking the [emerging voip wars](http://marketingplaybook.com/2005/02/14/vonage_running_bus_and_billboard_ads.html), and the most recent [skype device announcement](http://www.geekfishing.net/consumer/2005/02/14/skype_is_coming_out_on_mobile.html) -- wow, isn't this device the kind of thing that HP should have made back in the "HP Way" days? \* The Jobster team has gone live with [a company blog](http://www.jobster.blogs.com). \* A post I've been hanging onto for a while, Martin points to a blog all about [the best of 2004](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2004/12/the_best_2004_l.html) and wonders how to make a business out of. Does seem like a natural starting point for a nice little ecommerce business. \* Martin also continues [his biodiesel adventure](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/01/hanging_with_th.html)... \* One of the folks at Ignition has some Ethiopian family members -- here is a [cool post on the Ethopic number system](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExplainingTheEthiopicNumberingSystemAndATinyLessonOnAmharic.aspx), I had no idea. \* Some [criticism of Melodeo's service](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000637031287/) -- not sure I totally agree with, I think the Melodeo offering is a reasonable tradeoff of convenience and fairness, but I understand the point. \* Rich's pc hardware investigations -- [iscsi at home](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/02/08/iscsi_for_home.html) and [Does SLI matter (yes!)](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/pcs/2005/01/05/does_sli_matter.html). Crap, not only do I not have a water-cooled PC, now I also don't have iSCSI or an SLI config. I am a loser. \* Martin likes [these web radio stations.](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/01/my_new_favorite_1.html) I've never really understood the attraction, I am an ipod and in-car music listener. But I should try. \* Nice press for [network magic](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/01/freeware_of_the_3.html) (disclosure -- I'm on the board). \* Fred [points to Martin's posts](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=738) on tag systems. I am not a believer in tag systems. I think humans just want to do free text searches -- let the computers figure out how to parse and tag content. But certainly a lot of heat around tags right now.
