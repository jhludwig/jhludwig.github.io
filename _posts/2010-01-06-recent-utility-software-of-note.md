My MacBook is entering middle age and as my intensity of use has grown over the last 6 months (due to coursework at UW) I'm finding I need to start focusing on productivity a little. Some tools that seem helpful:

\* "Popchar":http://www.macility.com/products/popcharx/ provides much better special character insertion than the standard OSX tool. Helpful for entering math symbols, etc. I love this. The basic OSX system tool is weak. \* "Keycue":http://www.macility.com/products/keycue/ from the same guys, cheat sheet of keyboard shortcuts. Better than it sounds. I cannot remember all these keyboard shortcuts and this is way way way better than help/manual/online search. \* "Hazel":http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php for automagically managing files. My use case is dealing with downloads from various UW course sites and automagically handling. Keeps my downloads folder in order. Handy tho not absolutely mandatory. \* "Path Finder":http://www.cocoatech.com/ as a replacement for Finder. Definitely more handy for moving files between folders. \* "Growl":http://growl.info/ -- not sure why I installed but all the cool kids seem to use.

Also on my new Windows 7 setup I am starting to play with some things:

\* "Win7 multimonitor taskbars":http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheNearFinalWordOnMultiMonitorTaskbarsForWindows7UltramonVsDisplayFusion.aspx?utm\_source=feedburner&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=Feed%3A+ScottHanselman+%28Scott+Hanselman+-+ComputerZen.com%29&utm\_content=Google+Reader -- haven't tried these but probably should try one. \* "Feedroller":http://lifehacker.com/5352037/feedroller-puts-rss-and-twitter-updates-across-your-monitor?utm\_source=feedburner&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=Feed%3A+lifehacker%2Ffull+%28Lifehacker%29&utm\_content=Google+Reader -- well I wanted to love this, and it looks great, but seems to have problems updating its content.

And across both machines:

\* "Helvitical":http://www.iamadtaylor.com/helvetical/ and its friends Helvetimail and Helvetireader certainly improve the looks of google apps. A little buggy tho.
