Both of these come from [markpasc.org](http://markpasc.org/weblog/) -- [Shareware Amateurs vs. Shareware Professionals by Steve Pavlina](http://www.dexterity.com/articles/shareware-amateurs-vs-shareware-professionals.htm "Shareware Amateurs vs. Shareware Professionals by Steve Pavlina") -- a nice dissertation on the right and wrong ways to figure out what product to build; and Eric Sink's article on [product positioning](http://software.ericsink.com/Positioning.html) -- the fundamental point being that marketing begins well before you develop your product, not afterwards; and that you better be able to simply articulate what your product is for.
