[Marginal Revolution: Ten percent of the world's music market](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/05/ten_percent_of_.html "Marginal Revolution: Ten percent of the world's music market") is ringtones. Wow.

I draw two conclusions:

\* People want their music mobile. Fixed location music is worth a lot less than mobile music. \* People love to express themselves thru customization -- ringtones, custom engraving on ipods, faceplates, themes for blogs, etc. Never underestimate the demand for this.
