[Yahoo's spyware detector doesn't default to picking up adware](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1605578,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594) -- yeah I've noticed this too.  That said, the Yahoo spyware detector is free and seems to work pretty well.

I also just installed WinXP SP2 and am liking it's ability to detect and disable browser add-ins.
