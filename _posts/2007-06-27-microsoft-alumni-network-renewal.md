Apparently it is time to renew my [Microsoft Alumni Network](http://www.msanet.org/ "Microsoft Alumni Network Home Page") membership. $130. The only value I get is employee discounts on software. It is increasingly hard to justify this, there is darn little I want at the store. If I view the $130 as prepay on software, I have to buy a lot to make the savings add up to more than $130. Used to be I had relatives and friends asking for software a lot but that activity has dried up largely.
