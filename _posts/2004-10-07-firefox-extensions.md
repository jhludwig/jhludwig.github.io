OK I love the fact that there are a gazillion extensions available. But my gosh this is confusing. There is a huge need for an authoritative editorial voice and packager -- someone who pulls together the bundle of extensions needed for normal browsing, for a web developer, for an RSS junkie, for image-centric browsing, etc etc.
