[![](images/korrio-300x173.jpg "korrio")](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/korrio.jpg)One of the companies in our portfolio, "Korrio":https://korrio.com/, is bringing out tools to allow "parents to monitor the brain health of their child athletes":http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2012/01/startup-korrios-focus-on-head-injuries.html. This is a great step, I wish this had been around when we had young student athletes in the family. You don't have to dig around very much to see the frightful effects of head impacts in sports, and anything that raises awareness of the issue and provides tools to manage is a very good thing. There is a lot more to do, I'd love to see impact monitors in helmets that track instantaneous and cumulative impact forces, but this is a great first step, awesome to see this work happening.
