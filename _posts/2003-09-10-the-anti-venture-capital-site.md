Found via a comment on [Rich's](http://www.tongfamily.com) site -- [Venture capital is hazardous to your company's health in 9 out of 10 cases](http://www.antiventurecapital.com/venturecapital.html "Venture capital is hazardous to your company's health in 9 out of 10 cases") -- ouch! On the other hand, maybe he isn't talking about me:  
  
_With the first dollar of venture capital accepted the entrepreneur?s control slips away to 28-year-old MBA wonder-boys with only the shallowest of operating experience._  
  
The age 28 is long behind me, I was off in the shallow end of the operating pool at that time, hopefully I've learned something.
