- [This Idea Must Die](http://www.amazon.com/This-Idea-Must-Die-Scientific/dp/0062374346), ed. John Brockman. [Ben](http://benslivka.com/) pointed me towards this. A bit repetitive, but a lot of pithy observations by very bright people. Will be interesting to revisit in 20 years.
- [The Dream of Perpetual Motion](http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Perpetual-Motion-Playaway-Fiction-ebook/dp/B003A7I2PU) by Dexter Palmer. Need more mushrooms to enjoy this book. And a greater tolerance for farce.
- [Night Dogs](http://www.amazon.com/Night-Dogs-Kent-Anderson/dp/0553578774) by Kent Anderson. This is a rough book -- a rough tale, written roughly, edited roughly. All that said, it is compelling though not always easy to stomach.
- [Wraeththu](http://www.amazon.com/Wraeththu-Storm-Constantine/dp/0312890001) by Storm Constantine. I just don't know about this. It seems poorly written at times, and a little too mystical, and a little bizarre at times. I haven't finished but I haven't given up. It is resting on my desk and I am trying to decide whether to have another go.
