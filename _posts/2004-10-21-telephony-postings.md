\* [Nimcat eliminates PBX](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1681372,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594) -- pretty cool, the PBX functionality is distributed throughout the phones, they autodiscover each other. too pricey tho at $300+ per desk. \* [Grassroots ISP including IPTV and VOIP](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20040930.html) -- a great low end ISP offer. \* [Jon Udell reminds of the difference between VOIP and computer telephony](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/05.html#a1089) and the value of computer telephony

All makes me hopeful that as we move to IP telephony, a lot of innovative energy could be freed up and applied to the market.
