[![](images/otters-009-150x150.jpg "otters  009")](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/otters-009.jpg)Otters are so dang cute. It is hard not to fall in love with them. The picture doesn't do justice to the constant motion as they wrestle and cavort and untangle and retangle themselves. Who wouldn't love these little guys? Such a treat to see them in nature.

And then they crawl under the canvas on your boat and leave fish guts everywhere and crap all over everything.
