Not going to be posting much here. heads down on halloween. struggling last night with interfacing pneumatic valves to my dmx control system. tried a [gilderfluke](http://www.gilderfluke.com/) part to convert dmx input to analog output but it seems quite finicky about dmx input. Looking at maybe using a [Dove Systems MTX-DE8 8 Channel DMX to Analog Decoder](http://www.dovesystems.com/BuildPage.php?page=mtxde8&d= "Dove Systems MTX-DE8 8 Channel DMX to Analog Decoder") which is maybe where I should have started in the first place, since I have a lot of Dove dimmers and they have been rock solid for me. The good folks at [PNTA](http://www.pnta.com/index.html) are helping me sort it all out -- great folks for gear here in town.
