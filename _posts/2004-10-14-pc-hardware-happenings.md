\* [External audio solutions](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1649936,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532) -- the pc is electrically noisy and the amp circuits on sound cards are not that great -- maybe we should be moving all this functionality out of the pc (or the electical/amp characteristics of a pc should be more like an audio amp) \* [One man's attempt at widescreen gaming](http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=8c3c851f-00a1-4f9d-abde-56b50f5d5da5). Salivate. \* [Raid in a single drive bay](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/raid1-in-single-35-drive-bay-022386.php). I guess this is the natural complement to a dual core processor -- dual core hard drives! \* [Jeff Ort on color management](http://www.ortfamily.com/archive/2004/10/color_managemen.html#more).

I totally need this.

So what is the theme to all this? Besides "stuff that I want to buy?" My observation is that the PC Hardware industry continues to innovate like mad, and is going to wipeout all the standalone media boxes, settop boxes, etc.
