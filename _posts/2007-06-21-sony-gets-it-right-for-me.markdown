My [Sony - Reader](http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/ "Sony - Reader") broke, [Brad Feld has documented my support experience](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2007/06/customer_servic.html). Thankfully Sony was responsive and finally got it right, I have a brand new reader now and can get back to using it. I really like the device, and hopefully Sony will get the whole purchase and support solution right for everyone.
