A couple of good primers out on the net:

\* [A Primer on Index Notation](http://civil.colorado.edu/~crimaldi/teaching/cven5313/notes/IndexNotation.pdf ) from Colorado Civil Engineering. Practical intro to index notation \* [A Primer on Index Notation](http://ocw.mit.edu/NR/rdonlyres/Physics/8-07Fall-2005/D46A91E3-C5B0-4065-9ABF-C20927FBDD09/0/indexnotation.pdf) from MIT. A little more theoretical and discussion of use in calculus.

Somehow I did not ever learn about index notation in my past educational life. Time to learn.
