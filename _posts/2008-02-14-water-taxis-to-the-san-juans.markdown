I didn't know about these guys -- [Island Express Charters, San Juan Islands, Washington](http://www.islandexpresscharters.com/ "Island Express Charters, San Juan Islands, Washington"). I've used [Paraclete](http://www.paracletecharters.com/) a lot. If you don't need a car on the islands, way faster and more convenient than the WSF.
