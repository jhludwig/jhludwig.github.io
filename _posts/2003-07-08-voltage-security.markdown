[Voltage Security Inc.](http://www.voltagesecurity.com/ "Voltage Security Inc.") was mentioned in the WSJ yesterday, they seem really interesting as a way to use PKI without the hassle of key management. I have tried at least 10 times over the years to use PKI solutions and have always given up, key management is such a pain. This seems like a real usability breakthru.

Update: [Other VCs](http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2003/07/08.html#a283) are talking about too...
