**Future Vacations.** Looking thru Conde Nast Taveler's latest top 100 lists and dreaming. Around here, the [Aerie Resort](http://www.aerie.bc.ca/index.htm) on Vancouver Island and the [King Pacific Lodge](http://www.kingpacificlodge.com/) up near the Queen Charlottes look very interesting. Also the [Wickaninnish Inn](http://www.wickinn.com/) in Tofino.

We've also heard great things about the [Tu Tu' Tun](http://www.tututun.com/) in Oregon.
