- If price is no object -- [Scarefactory furniture](http://www.scarefactory.com/catalog/furniture1.htm#FRN614) -- most of this is a little too gory for my tastes, but great stuff.
- [Cloud lamp](http://www.emanator.demon.co.uk/bigclive/cloud.htm) - nice little project. I think 10 of these little touches can do a lot more for your setup than one big expensive prop.
- Various ideas on [how to make flickering light effects from LEDs](http://spookyblue.com/halloween/flickerlight/spookyfire/ingenious.htm). Some more [LED flicker ideas](http://johnnyspage.com/LED%20Flicker.htm)
- [PVCplans](http://pvcplans.com/) -- helpful for building structures (mausoleums, etc)

Thanks to [methodzofmadness forums](http://www.methodzofmadness.com) where most of these ideas are traded.
