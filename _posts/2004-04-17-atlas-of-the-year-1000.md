[Atlas of the Year 1000](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/067400678X/qid=1082271235/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-6433474-1582450?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Atlas of the Year 1000") is a great little read. Walks thru the major political structures in the year 1000 around the world, and the changes that were happening to them. Lots of maps.

Really showed how pathetic my world history education is -- history started in 1776 by my education. There are just huge domains of asian, middle eastern, african history of which I am woefully ignorant.

And I'm a sucker for maps.
