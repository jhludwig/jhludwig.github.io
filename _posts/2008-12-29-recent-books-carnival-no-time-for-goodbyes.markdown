\* "Carnival":amazon by Elizabeth Bear. Far future dystopias wracked apart by multilayered conspiracies. Fun story, interesting societies, good characters. \* "No Time For Goodbyes":amazon by Linwood Barclay. Great opening and a solid story overall though it never quite matches up to the evocativeness of the opening.
