Great article about [Lowe's](http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,3959,1124618,00.asp "Lowe's Big Plan") and how they manage their shelfspace. Their use of software to examine buying behaviour and plan out merchandise displays is fascinating. And it is interesting to see how their use of [MarketMax](http://www.marketmax.com/) gets pushed out to their suppliers -- what a great pull for MarketMax. Found via [Anil Dash](http://www.dashes.com/anil/) (whose website is curiously unresponsive today).
