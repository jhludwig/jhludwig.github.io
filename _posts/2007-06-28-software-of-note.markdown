A little unobvious to use. \* [Socialcalc](http://danbricklin.com/log/2007_04_12.htm#socialcalc1_1). I continue to think this is interesting tho I have never installed it. hmm. \* Rich's [guide to cleaning up Raw images](http://www.tongfamily.com/photography/digital_workflow/best_workflow.php) \* [The Alphabetizer](http://alphabetizer.flap.tv/). I can see myself using this occasionally. \* [3 awesome free math programs](http://math-blog.com/2007/06/02/3-awesome-free-math-programs/)
