A burgeoning interest area of mine is adult or continuing education. I seriously considered in the last couple years enrolling in a phd program but the traditional university structure just doesn't work well for adults with families, jobs, etc.

I wonder if programs like [Capella University](http://www.capella.edu/default.aspx) are viable.
