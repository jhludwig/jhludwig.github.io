Excellent [review here](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AmazonKindle.aspx) -- agree with most of it. The integrated wireless and the Amazon.com integration make this thing sing. It has completely changed my reading and my buying habits -- if a book I want doesn't have a Kindle edition, i save it in my wishlist for later, and I'll probably only buy it once a Kindle version shows up. And the Kindle disease is spreading, I just learned that Dad has one as well!
