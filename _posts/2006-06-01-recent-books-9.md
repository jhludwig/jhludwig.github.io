\* "Manifold: Origin":amazon by Stephen Baxter. Read this to complete a trilogy by the author, speculating on the future of our race. Some great ideas but some massively dull narrative, and characters I just didn't care about. Yawn. After this I needed to raise my sights a little. \* "The Bridge of San Luis Rey":amazon by Thornton Wilder. Wonderful book. Makes you want to run to Peru. The bittersweetness of a colonial capital really comes thru -- the center of local society, but longs to be respected by the mother society half a world away. The characters and outcomes are oh so human. \* "The Stranger":amazon by Camus. Certainly a strong story. A strong lesson about failure to commit to and connect with the world. A little harder to connect with than San Luis Rey -- it is much harder to put yourself in the lead character's shoes.

And I didn't read it yet but was motivated by [this review to order Sahara Overland](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001239.php) -- sounds fascinating.
