\* "Coalescent":amazon by Stephen Baxter. Historical speculative fiction about a sub-species of humanity which has developed hidden alongside us. In the hands of Stephen King at his prime, this would have been a killer tale. Still a fine tale but not overwhelming. \* "Chasing Darkness":amazon by Robert Crais. Solid detective tale tho not particularly novel. LA ex-cop PI gets pulled into a police case. Some of his old colleagues hate him, some help him. Pretty standard themes.
