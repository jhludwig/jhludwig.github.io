Nice list at [Neil's World - Pinging service run-down](http://www.neilturner.me.uk/2004/Jan/30/pinging_service_rundown.html "Neil's World - Pinging service run-down") of all the services you might want to ping. I've updated my list, I also ping the folks at http://seablogs.hellbent.org/. You'd think someone would do a ping mirv service so I would just have to ping one thing, and they could distribute the pings out.
