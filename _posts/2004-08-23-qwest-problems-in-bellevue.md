Our phone line is out...The [Qwest online trouble ticket page](https://kai08.qwest.com/cwt/repair/login.aspx) is telling us that it won't be fixed until 8/29 ???

Wow my vonage line+comcast cable modem is better than this...

The really strange thing is that a spurious 911 call was generated on our line the morning it went out. Presumably related in some way.
