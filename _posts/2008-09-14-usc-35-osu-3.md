Sigh. USC is a great team, there was probably no way OSU was winning this game. The turning point was in the 2nd quarter when OSU penalized themselves out of a score. Things just got worse.

You have to pin the poor performance on coaching. USC offense and defense both have commented that they didn't see anything surprising. OSU put no pressure on USC offensively or defensively. No interesting halftime adjustments -- in fact halftime misadjustments as the staff decided to let Boechman carry the load -- an impossible position for him with no running threat to keep the defense honest. There were a lot of stupid penalties and some really poor qb decisions to put the icing on the cake.

Here's hoping that the staff learns something from this debacle.

On the plus side, the USC fans around us couldn't have been nicer. Families, alums, a very pleasant crowd.
