Sigh been trying to make this work and it looks like it never will -- [Networking a mac and a xp computer with a kodak 5500 printer - FixYa](http://www.fixya.com/support/t360707-networking_mac_xp_computer_kodak_5500) -- apparently a lot of printers don't support the necessary features for network use from a Mac. So I am going to have to buy another freaking printer -- [official Mac driver support here](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306684) -- you have to make sure you get one with a "modern" driver.

PS Thanks to the [Pure Networks](http://www.networkmagic.com) guys for helping me figure this out.
