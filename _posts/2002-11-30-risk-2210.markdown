**Risk 2210.** Hey rich when you tire of [Risk](http://www.tongfamily.com/weblog/2002_11_01_archive.asp#85279344), try [Risk 2210](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005LL3I/qid=1038673358/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-7929887-9967955?v=glance&s=toys&n=507846) as well. Faster paced, and some nice touches that inject randomness and the need for extreme strategy shifts into the game.
