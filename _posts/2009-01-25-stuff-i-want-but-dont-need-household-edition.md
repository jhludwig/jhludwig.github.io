- [Imm Living](http://www.imm-living.com/products/totem.php). Love these totem coffee cups.
- And this [woodgrain pillow](http://design-milk.com/woodgrain-pillow/) tho the color choices don't work for us anywhere
- Brilliant little [painting tool](http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/useful_tools_paintbrush_holder_and_paint_can_opener_12339.asp)
- [Corner clamp](http://toolmonger.com/2008/09/08/kregs-new-corner-clamp/) -- looks positively frightening when not in use, like some medieval dentistry tool
