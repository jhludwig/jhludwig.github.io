Frank nails it -- [pseudorandom: "A Kind of Cockamamie Sincerity"](http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/000857.html "pseudorandom: ") -- we couldn't stop watching Johnny Depp. Some of us have seen the movie twice now. I want to see all the rest of Johnny's work now. _Pirates_ may not be the best movie of the summer, but Johnny's performance is clearly among the best of the year.
