Another site recommended by prop builders for pneumatic gear -- [Surplus Center - Hydraulic Equip Electric Motors Engines Gear Reducers](http://www.surpluscenter.com/ "Surplus Center - Hydraulic Equip Electric Motors Engines Gear Reducers") -- apparently they have floor switch mats too. I've never posted this up here but a reminder -- you really want to buy commercial grade pneumatic cylinders for your props. They aren't that expensive. Some folks try to jury rig cylinders out of PVC or screen door closers, but these apparently have the bad habit of exploding and placing shards of plastic and metal into anyone around.
