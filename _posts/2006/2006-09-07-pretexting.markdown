[Wired News: HP Dragnet Grabbed 9 Reporters](http://www.wired.com/news/politics/privacy/0,71749-0.html?tw=rss.index "Wired News: HP Dragnet Grabbed 9 Reporters") -- isn't this just lying? Fraud? Tactics equivalent to social engineering used by identity thieves? Why does the press keep calling this "pretexting"? Seems like felony class fraud to me.
