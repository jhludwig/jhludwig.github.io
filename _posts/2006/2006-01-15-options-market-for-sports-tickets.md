[The Ticket Reserve](http://www.theticketreserve.com/Tritone/home.html) is an options market for sports tickets. Very cool. You pay the quoted prices on top of the face value ticket prices. Seahawks Super Bowl spots going for $750, up $250. $100 for an all-BCS bowl pass for OSU for next year. Very tempting.
