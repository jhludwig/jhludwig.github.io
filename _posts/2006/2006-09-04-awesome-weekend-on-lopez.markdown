We had a great weekend. Some people that made it possible:

\* [Paraclete Charter Service - Your charter and ferry service to the San Juan Islands, Washington](http://www.paracletecharters.com/ "Paraclete Charter Service - Your charter and ferry service to the San Juan Islands, Washington") \* Everyone at [Greene Partners](http://www.greenepartners.com/) -- great job on our place. Just a great design at every level that really worked for us, and super people who helped us with so much more. \* [Jennifer Randall & Associates](http://www.jradesigns.com/jrahome.html) -- also a great job on our place. Everything from broad schemes to little details were just awesome, and again great people. \* [Ravenhill Construction](http://www.ravenhillconstruction.com/) -- also a great job on our place. The workmanship, fit and finish were all great. \* [On-Site Island Services](http://www.wrelopez.com/favlinks.html) -- super job getting everything ready \* [Vita's](http://www.judysbook.com/members/15917/posts/2005/9/157880/) -- awesome takeout and a nice wine recommendation \* Alwyn at [Rhythm Auto Repair](http://sanjuanislands.citysearch.com/profile/10833641/lopez_island_wa/rhythm_auto_repair.html) -- provided us with wheels, very appreciated.

Can't wait to get back.
