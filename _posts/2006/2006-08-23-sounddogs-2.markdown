I've been working on my halloween soundtracks and I needed some new thunder sounds. I've been using some thunder tracks off of old sfx cds but they have a lot of ambient hiss -- sometimes by design to sound like rain, sometimes just crappy recorded. When you amp up these tracks for outdoor usage, the hiss is just too much.

I wanted some clean thunder tracks and so went to [Sound Effects, Production Music, Royalty Free Music, MP3 AIF WAV Sound Effects](http://www.sounddogs.com/ "Sound Effects, Production Music, Royalty Free Music, MP3 AIF WAV Sound Effects"). Great experience -- they have more choices than you can possibly imagine, and they deliver in just about any encoding form you could want. And to reward me, they sent me a free sfx after I ordered -- pretty smart, the marginal cost of them doing this is basically nothing and they have made me happy. Recommended.
