Good thanksgiving at [The Boulders Resort & Golden Door Spa](http://theboulders.com/?s_kwcid=the%20boulders|749892254 "Scottsdale Resorts & Carefree Arizona Hotels - The Boulders Resort & Golden Door Spa") -- maybe not the best family resort in the world, but their service was impeccable, the weather was great, we had a good time. They especially did a great job delivering a Thanksgiving meal to our casita.
