[Why NFL stadiums are so much newer than college stadiums](http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2006_05_01__arch_file.htm#114796151752270128). And for me at least, more boring.

And [pithy excerpts](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/05/measuirng_sport.html) from "The Wages of Wins: Taking Measure of the Many Myths in Modern Sport":amazon -- sounds like a good book.
