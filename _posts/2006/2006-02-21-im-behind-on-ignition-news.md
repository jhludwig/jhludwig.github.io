\* Congrats to the [Judy's Book team](http://www.judysbook.com) on their site relaunch. A new look -- the new page for nonmembers is great. The ability to simultaneously post to JB and to your blog is awesome -- [rich](http://www.tongfamily.com) has been doing a lot of. I'm way behind Rich on posting volume but working to ratchet my rate up. (I'm on the board of directors). \* Congrats to the [Qiming team](http://www.qimingventures.com/) for the launch of their first fund. An Ignition partnership, some of my partners will be spending a LOT of time there.
