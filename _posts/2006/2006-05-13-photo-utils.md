[Rich reminded me](http://www.tongfamily.com/photography/noise_ninja_neat_image_and_dxo.php) of [dxo](http://dxo.com/en/photo/home/default.php) and pointed me towards [noise ninja](http://www.picturecode.com/) and neatimage. Dxo is cool tho I don't know that I really appreciate the coolness of it. NoiseNinja does more for me because I have really noticed the noise in some of my pictures. They all seem to work great.
