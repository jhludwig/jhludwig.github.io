Pretty inspirational guy -- [Survival of the Most Adaptable](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=survival_of_the_most_adaptable), and also his post on [first meeting scott](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=on_me_and_scott). Certainly would make me feel that there was a great leader at the helm if I was at Sun.
