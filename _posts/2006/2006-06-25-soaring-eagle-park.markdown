My close-in park of choice for quick hikes is Cougar Mountain, but [Soaring Eagle](http://www5.metrokc.gov/reports/parkinfo/getParkInfo.asp?PID=2726,Soaring%20Eagle%20Regional%20Park "King County Parks and Facilities Information") looks like an interesting choice too. Thanks to [Steve](http://www.furrygoat.com/2006/06/hiking.html) for the tip. And thanks also to King County for their [killer online trail maps and info](http://www.metrokc.gov/parks/trails/)
