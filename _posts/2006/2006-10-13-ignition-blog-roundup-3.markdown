\* [Melodeo launches with cingular](http://www.bobsplanet.com/serendipity/archives/106-Melodeo-Cingular-Launch.html ) -- congrats! \* Rich on the [Sony HD videocam](http://www.tongfamily.com/home_movies/camcorders/sony_hdrsr1_ship_october_21.php) -- the perfect xmas present! \* Also rich points me towards an [IR-compatible camera](http://www.tongfamily.com/fujifilm_finepix_s3_pro_uvir.php) -- I've been using a Sony DSC-F828 for a couple years and been happy, but would be great to have some lens options. Get your mind out of the gutter, this is for Halloween pix. \* Phil found [deskfinder](http://thebogles.com/blog/2006/10/deskfinder-wireless-search-of-your-desktop/ ) \-- remote search of your desktop from your blackberry. pretty awesome. \* As [Brad](http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/002001.html) notes, [JudysBook](http://www.judysbook.com) has done a major facelift. Looks good... \* Network Magic pricing has changed, and [Jeff has gotten a lot of great feedback and support](http://www.networkgarage.com/2006/10/change_in_network_magic_pricin.html). Great to see the direct engagement with the customers.
