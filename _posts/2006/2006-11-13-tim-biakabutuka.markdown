I don't think there is any Wolverine I hate more than [Tim Biakabutuka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Biakabutuka "Tim Biakabutuka - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") -- he made OSU look silly in '95. A classic game of the Cooper years, OSU came in undefeated and threw up. I still feel the pain.
