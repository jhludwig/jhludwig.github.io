A reader recommended this -- [Haunt Controller - Software for automating your haunt - holiday display - animatronics](http://www.hauntcontroller.com/products_software_pro.php "Haunt Controller - Software for automating your haunt - holiday display - animatronics") -- PC software that interfaces with [these kit74 relay boards](http://www.hauntcontroller.com/where_to_buy.php). Looks kind of cool. I think it is too late for me to play around with this halloween but I would certainly consider for next. I guess it doesn't give me materially different controllability than my DMX software and dimmers but it is a lot cheaper.
