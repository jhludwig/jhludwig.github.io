Rich got me excited about rebates and deals on technology -- [Tong Family Blog: Current Canon Rebates](http://www.tongfamily.com/current_canon_rebates.php "Tong Family Blog: Current Canon Rebates") -- great deals on Canon cameras. I did a quick search because i need a new printer for HP Rebates and wow there are a lot of offers out there -- [HP Rebate Gateway](http://www.hp.com/united-states/rebateGateway.html) , [HP Hot Deals](http://www.hp.com/sbso/special/hotdeals.html), [HP Web Deals](http://www.hpwebdeals.com/?s=100&k=801) (Is this an official HP site?). Oh I might need a new TIVO too and so I found the [Tivo Rebate center](http://www.tivorebates.com/promocenter/tivo/track.html). I suspect if I cataloged all the hardware and software on my home network and methodically looked for logical deals and upgrade offers, I would find a lot of great offers. And then there are all the local retailer deals. It is inconvenient to sort thru all this, I really need an automagic way to harvest all the deals I am likely to be interested in.
