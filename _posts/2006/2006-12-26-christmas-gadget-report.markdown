\* [20Q.net Inc.](http://www.20q.net/ "20Q.net Inc.") -- exceeded expectations. cheap and fun. \* [Wii](http://wii.com/) -- exceeded expectations. The controller makes even simple games way fun. We just need more good games now -- a good flying game would be fun. \* [Sony reader](http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/reader/). Great promise. The display looks really nice. The PC software is not horrible. The visual artifacts on page flipping are really annoying. But a great first attempt.
