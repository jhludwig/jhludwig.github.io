Also a random tip on this page -- _"Want a "dead ringer" for Halloween? Run a string from a grave up to a bell mounted on the tombstone!"_ -- I might try this. \* Another random good tip I read -- used rotisserie motors make great prop animators \* [Electronic Goldmine](http://www.goldmine-elec.com/default.htm) for random electronic and control supplies \* What to do with an old CRT?? Make it into [the world's heaviest strobe light](http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2006/01/how_to_make_a_strobe_out_of_a.html) of course. \* [Article on 4-bar linkage design](http://www.machinedesign.com/ASP/viewSelectedArticle.asp?strArticleId=60469&strSite=MDSite&Screen=CURRENTISSUE&CatID=3) \* [Fittings Depot](http://www.fittingsdepot.com/index.html) \-- for pneuma fittings. Awesome. \* Great article on [how to use a Shiatsu massager](http://www.methodzofmadness.com/php/smf/index.php?topic=2325.new#new) as the basis of a prop. \* [EFX-tek](http://www.efx-tek.com/) prop controllers.
