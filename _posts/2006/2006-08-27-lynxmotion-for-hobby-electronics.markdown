I exhausted myself driving around yesterday looking for connectors and other electronics parts for some halloween projects. [Vetco](http://www.vetco.net/), [radio Shack](http://www.radioshack.com), [frys](http://www.frys.com) were all strike outs as were the local hobby stores.

[Lynxmotion](http://www.lynxmotion.com/Default.aspx?SSLRedirect=true&ContentCode=Home "Lynxmotion Robot Kits") is the place to go, they have all the stuff I needed. Should have started there. I wanted instant gratification but just got frustrated.
