Of course the Buckeyes looked brilliant in beating Texas in Texas as expected. So all is basically right with the world. But look at the rest of these outcomes -- [NCAA Football Scoreboard - CBS SportsLine.com](http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/scoreboard/BIG10/2006/week2 "NCAA Football Scoreboard - CBS SportsLine.com")

\* Wisconsin seemed to win handily over a weak opponent, they can feel good. \* Michigan and Michigan State won by big margins over weak opponents -- but each gave up a lot of first half points. \* Iowa, Purdue, and Indiana struggled to win against clearly inferior opponents. I guess Indiana should feel good about any victory. \* Penn State and Minnesota thumped by top 25 teams. \* and Illinois and Northwestern thumped by weak opponents.

After the 11-0 Big Ten start last week I was feeling pretty good about the league. Not so much now.
