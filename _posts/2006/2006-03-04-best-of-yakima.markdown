OK I have no idea if this is the best of Yakima but it is what I found in 4 days there:

\* Where to stay -- we stayed in the Hojo's, it was merely adequate. Locals tell me that the Red Lion and the new Marriott Courtyard are nicer \* Dining -- [Zesta Cucina](http://www.zestacucina.com/menu/index.html) was great! The find of the trip. Great atmosphere, and they handled our huge group (45+) well. We also dined at the [Olive Garden](http://www.olivegarden.com) -- it was yet another Olive Garden -- and at Tequila's -- standard chain Mexican but in converted railroad cars downtown so kind of fun. Both the Garden and Tequila's also did a good job with our mob. In all cases, do the restaurant a favor -- have one person pay and figure out how to break it up later. \* Lunch -- El Grullense (near the Sundome) is a fine little taqueria. And Miner's (also near the dome) is classic burger drive-in fare. \* Recreation -- well of course if you are there for a high school state tournament or a state fair then you will spend a lot of time at the [Sundome](http://www.fairfun.com/sundome/). Note that they have some fairly restrictive rules about fan behaviour for high school events so you might want to dig into it before you go - signs, bodypainting, too much standing, boomboxes -- all prohibited. As is outside food of any sort. \* Other recreation -- the riverwalk along the Naches and Yakima rivers is a pleasant walk. And you can get into the Cascades to the west in a half hour for hiking etc. The [Naches Ranger Station on Route 12](http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/wenatchee/forest/formain.htm) is a great place to stop and get current condition info, maps, etc. Based on my experience - bring snowshoes if you are heading out in early march, because there aren't many trails clear yet.
