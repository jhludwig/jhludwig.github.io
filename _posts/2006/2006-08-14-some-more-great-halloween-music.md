\* False Positive by [Childman](http://www.lala.com/frontend/action/albumdetails?id=72339069014728496) -- best if you use a voice filter to distort the voice into near-recognizability. \* Bach -- [Toccata in D Minor, Fugue in C Minor, Passacaglia in C Minor, Prelude in G Minor, Fugue in B Minor](http://www.lala.com/frontend/action/albumdetails?id=72339069015099734) -- all these are great organ pieces
