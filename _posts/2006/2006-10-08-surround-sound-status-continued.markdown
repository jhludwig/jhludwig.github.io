Continuing to plug away on my halloween surround sound setup -- [A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: Halloween Surround Sound Status](http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/10/halloween_surround_sound_statu.html "A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: Halloween Surround Sound Status") One awesomely great feature of the [turtlebeach audioadvantage roadie](http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/audioadv/roadie/producthome.asp) is the headphone jack. You can use it simultaneously with the spdif out -- so many sound cards turn off the speaker out when a headphone is detected. here you can use both. the documented use is to attach another pair of speakers to create a 7.1 setup. But for halloween you can use this extra output to drive your lightning controller such as the [i-zombie](http://www.i-zombie.com/).

So my sound is working great. my lighting controllers are all firing. now i am playing around with lights -- halogen worklights, par lights, some low voltage stuff -- to create the best effect.

Oh and i am working on my other surround sound config which won't be lightning, but will be ambient graveyard sounds.
