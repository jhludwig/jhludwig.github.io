[Springs -- from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics](http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/topics/Springs.html "Springs -- from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics") -- good basic primer on springs. Needed for my EE502 class. Once upon a time I learned this stuff but that has been several geologic eras ago.
