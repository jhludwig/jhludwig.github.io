All my gear and props delivered from [door  to door storage](http://www.doortodoor.com/) over the weekend and unpacked today.  I've used these guys for storage for 4 years now and they have been great.

Got my pneumatic valves hooked up to [EFX-TEK :: Prop-1 Controller](http://www.efx-tek.com/topics/prop-1.html). This is my planned controller strategy this year. Seems to work just great -- I don't have air hooked up yet but the valves are all click-clacking away under program control.

Also got my [i-zombie lighting controllers](http://www.i-zombie.com/) today. As is obvious, I am moving away a little from pc-based control this year and towards a bunch of discrete systems -- easier to debug, harder to manage.

Oh and [Scott](http://www.scaredy-cat.com/bio.html) graciously showed me some of his past work -- awesome. I am really motivated to give the axworthy ghost another try tho I may not have the time this year.
