As I mentioned a couple days ago, I'd really like to flip my home phone system to an asterisk-based system, but I need a reseller because a) i don't have time to do the deployment myself, b) i don't want to be frontline support for my household, c) a special case of a, i have some funky analog control stuff wired into my current phone system that i need someone else to spend time figuring out how to plug into asterisk -- intercoms, some mechanical actuators. It is probably not that hard but I don't have a lot of time.

[asterisk reseller - Google Search](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1B2GGGL_enUS175US175&q=asterisk reseller "asterisk reseller - Google Search") -- points me towards [digium](http://www.digium.com/en/ecosystem/resellers/). They in turn pointed me toward [bitstruct](http://www.bitstruct.com/) and [digitalcandle](http://www.digitalcandle.com/asterisk), both of whom have been totally unresponsive -- their websites don't inspire confidence in their asterisk reselling skills either. The [guys that did my home theatre install](http://www.hometechnologies.com/index.shtml) don't do telephony projects, they pointed me towards someone who wanted to sell some exchange/activedirectory integrated thing, not what i am after.

If you know of an asterisk reseller/installer...
