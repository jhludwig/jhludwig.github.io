Been a while since I had time to play with any software.

\* [Beyond Compare 2.4 out](http://www.scootersoftware.com/download.php). What I've been using to keep machines in sync... \* ...but I hear good things about [syncback](www.2brightsparks.com) as well \* [Hamachi](http://www.hamachi.cc/) \-- a lightweight VPN solution. [Rich](http://www.tongfamily.com) pointed me at this. I am a little nervous about putting a VPN server on the home network. \* [Wikicalc latest version](http://danbricklin.com/log/2006_01_12.htm#wikicalc0_3). Now that Google has purchased writely i guess we will see a feeding frenzy around online spreadsheets and presentation packages. \* [Pocketmod](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2006/02/freeware_of_the.html). Low tech but decidedly useful. \* [Rich on backing up game cds](http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/games/backup_up_cds.php). It is a lot of bother. \* [Siteadvisor](http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2006/2/2/1741838.html) plugin. Nice. \* [Why Reboot?](http://www.larkware.com/dg5/TheDailyGrind810.html) A handy little doohickey for the curious. Another handy little thingee -- [Brutus](http://www.tipmonkies.com/2005/12/16/one-click-shutdown-using-brutus) \-- easy shutdown and restart. \* [Phil on structured blogging plugin](http://thebogles.com/blog/2006/01/structured-blogging-plugin-for-wordpress-and-movable-type/). I think edgeio is going to be easy for me to adopt. \* [Rich on video screensavers](http://www.tongfamily.com/pcs/windows/cool_screensavers.php). Tried one and got hung up on not having the right codecs, grrr. Nice idea tho. \* [Hyperwords plugin](http://www.hyperwords.net). Not sure it is that helpful.
