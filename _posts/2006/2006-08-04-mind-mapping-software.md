I need to create a mindmap for a health issue -- something where I can relate symptoms to diseases to indicators to remedies to ... I thought about just doing a database app but I'd like to be able to drag stuff around on the screen easily and look at the web of connections.

So it looks like I could use [Mindmapper](http://www.mindmapper.com) or [MindJet](http://www.MindJet.com) or [Visual Mind](http://www.visual-mind.com) or [PersonalBrain](http://www.thebrain.com/) or a dozen others -- [wikipedia lists a kabillion choices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map). I used Personal Brain years ago and it was ok. It would be awesome if one of these was hosted on a MySQL db so I could also query directly but it doesn't look like that exists. Maybe [freemind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeMind) is the way to go, exports in a nice format useable by an external php/mysql wiki tool.
