Need to equip a car with a mini kitchen -- looking for travel appliances. [Compact Appliance](http://www.compactappliance.com/xq/JSP.jump/itemType.CATEGORY/itemID.567/qx/12_Volt___Travel_Coolers.htm) seems to have a ton of travel coolers but not so many microwaves. Microwaves at [roadtrucker](http://roadtruckerhttp://www.roadtrucker.com/12-volt-kitchen-3.htm). I wonder how these work overnight when the car is off?
