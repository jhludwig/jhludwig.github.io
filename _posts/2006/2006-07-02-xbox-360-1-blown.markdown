OK our first 360 bit the dust. locks up 1 minute after booting. 7 months into owning it -- just out of the warranty phase. so $129 to get it fixed -- this must be the microsoft strategy for making money, $129 every six months...

I considered buying a new one at the msft company store but they don't seem to have them, and i am not sure the discount would be anything special.

the real pain is the amount of time to get it fixed. they are shipping us a mailing box, it will take 3-5 business days to arrive. then another 3-5 to return to them. then 3-5 to fix and 3-5 to get back. so a month gone. during summer vacation high season. not good.
