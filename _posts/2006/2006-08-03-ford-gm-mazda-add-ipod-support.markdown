[Ford, GM, Mazda add ipod support](http://www.betanews.com/article/Ford_GM_Mazda_Add_iPod_Support/1154621157) -- about time. Is there any reason 5 years from now the entire entertainment center of a car won't be replaced by an ipod? basically the manufacturer will install speakers and an amp and a connector for inserting ipods. all that expensive multidisc player hoo-ha will be gone. similar thing happening to home entertainment systems. it's an ipod world.
