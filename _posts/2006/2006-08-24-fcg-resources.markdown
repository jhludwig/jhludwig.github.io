[Kurt](http://www.grimvisions.com "Kurt ") mentioned to me what a draw his Flying Crank Ghost was. Motivated me to look more deeply into. Here are the key resources I found:  
  

- of course, [phantasmechanics](http://www.phantasmechanics.com "phantasmechanics") . The mother lode. They provide a written guide to building your own; kits for you to assemble; or completely assembled props. And they are super responsive on email.
- [The Iron Kingdom](http://www.theironkingdom.com/ "The Iron Kingdom"). A bunch of FCG and FCG-derived kits, plus some other great prop kits.
- A whole gallery of finished FCGs at [Kick The Fog](http://www.kickthefog.com/fcg_guild.htm "Kick The Fog").  
    
- A [plan for a crypt](http://homepage.mac.com/nephilim/imagineerieing/2004/crypt.html "plan for a crypt") to house your FCG
- A [scary ghost](http://www.thehorrordome.com/HDPROPS/crank.htm "scary ghost") to hang off your mechanism
- Ebay has a ton of [FCG related auctions](http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&fkr=1&from=R8&satitle=flying+crank+ghost&category0= "FCG related auctions") -- or better yet here is the [Mpire page analyzing FCG auctions](http://www.mpire.com/buyer/results.page?query=flying+crank+ghost+ "Mpire page analyzing FCG auctions")
