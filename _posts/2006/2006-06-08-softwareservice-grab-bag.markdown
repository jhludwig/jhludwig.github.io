- Using [Lala](http://www.lala.com) a lot these days! We're investors, but I do love it.
- The [IETab](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1419/) plugin for firefox is a requirement if you use OWA. Awesome.
- Trying out [google browser sync](http://www.internet-nexus.com/2006/06/google-browser-sync.htm)...
- [Carbonite](http://www.carbonite.com) -- love the idea and the team is very responsive. They don't support USB-attached drives for business reasons which is kind of a bummer. But the app does seem to work well.
- [Windows Vista user accounts](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1972182,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532) -- probably the only software feature of vista that is a "must have" for me. I run all our machines in user mode today and it is a pain in the ass.
