[Audacity: Free Audio Editor and Recorder](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ "Audacity: Free Audio Editor and Recorder") -- recommended by an online halloween buddy for sound editting. i'm currently using sony's acidpro because i'm doing some mixing and surround panning as well, but this is probably worth trying out. acidpro is overkill for simple tweaking.
