[A VC: Productivity Apps In The Cloud](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2006/06/productivity_ap.html "A VC: Productivity Apps In The Cloud") -- "Except all of Microsoft's editors, including the flagship editor Word, lack the simple functionality of being able to edit and save directly on the web. And as I sit here dreaming about being able to use Google Spreadsheet, that is the one function I want."

Me too. I use half a dozen machines regularly, i use kiosk machines, I want all my docs everywhere. And I don't need all the features of high-end office apps. Writely is fine for me, I am sure an online spreadsheet will be good enough too. And I am so tired of installing software on machines.
