Less than 6 days to the game of the millenium. I kind of prefer the [Sporstline countdown time](http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball)r over the [The Columbus Dispatch](http://www.dispatch.com/ "The Columbus Dispatch") countdown timer. And they differ by an hour?

As far as I can tell, neither of the Detroit papers have a countdown timer, they just aren't serious about the game, which is a strike against them.
