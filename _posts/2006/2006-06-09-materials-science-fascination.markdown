If I were going to college today, I'd be studying materials science. In fact I've been looking at online master's degree programs -- [UW](http://www.engr.washington.edu/edge/materials.html#dept) and [Columbia](http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/b/degrees/msms.html) both have interesting programs. A better use of my time than [Oblivion](http://www.elderscrolls.com/home/home.htm).

I'd be studying materials science because things like the following fascinate me:

\* Batteries that recharge in seconds -- [ScienCentral Video News: Super Battery](http://www.sciencentral.com/articles/view.php3?type=article&article_id=218392803 "ScienCentral Video News: Super Battery") \* Massive increases in data density on disks -- [heat-assisted data storage](http://www.physorg.com/news69077904.html) \* Just because you can make them -- [gold buckyballs](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/270368_buckyball16.html)
