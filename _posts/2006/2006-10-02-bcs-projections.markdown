I don't think I'd do a better job than this guy -- [Bowl Championship Series Ratings](http://www.tellshowbcs.com/ "Bowl Championship Series Ratings"). Obviously the Buckeyes control their own fate. The interesting discussion is the #2 position which USC currently owns. It is amazing to think that if USC wins out and say an Auburn or Florida wins out, USC would go to the title game and the SEC team would get screwed.
