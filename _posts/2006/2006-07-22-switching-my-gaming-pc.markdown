Getting ready to switch from a [WidowPC](http://www.widowpc.com/ "Gaming Computers, Gaming Laptops, Computer Gaming Support!") box to an [Alienware](http://www.alienware.com) box. I've had the WidowPC box 8 months, it is a nice SLI liquid-cooled box, but it has had thermal problems from the day I got it and no longer runs. WidowPC is honestly not that responsive. I think they are just too small -- my order number suggests I am approximately customer number 1000, and my support requests suggests they have handled ~4000 support requests --- not large numbers, and too many requests per box.

Alienware offers onsite service and for the kind of bleeding edge boxes I buy, I think that is worthwhile. I just don't have the time to be front line of support for myself, like [Bob is for himself](http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/07/bobs_pc_struggles.html).
