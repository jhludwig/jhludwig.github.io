- [Don't Buy Product Warranties](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/10/dont_buy_produc.html) -- no shocker here. Anything the stores are pushing that hard can't be good for you.
- [How higher RPM drives rip you off](http://www.internet-nexus.com/2006/09/how-higher-rpm-hard-drives-rip-you-off.htm) -- some contention around this but interesting
- [Hidden light bulb camera](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20060825/hidden-light-bulb-camera/) -- cool
- [Parallel Jaw pliers](http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001300.php) -- also cool
- [Han Solo in lego carbonite](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20060713/lego-art-han-solo-in-carbonite/) -- ouch
- [Unfortunate domain names](http://independentsources.com/2006/07/12/worst-company-urls/) -- very ouch
- [Unlimited gmail addresses](http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/5521) -- wish our stupid exchange server would do this
- [AStores](http://www.webmink.net/2006/09/astore.htm). interesting, I guess I should have one.
- [Viewscore](http://viewscore.com/) -- aggregated product reviews. Would be nice to combine with Astores.
- [Bob points to Hikipedia](http://www.bobsplanet.com/serendipity/archives/96-Hiking-the-web-Hikipedia-and-geotagging.html) -- useful
- [Winsnap in here](http://www.larkware.com/dg6/TheDailyGrind978.aspx) is a nice replacement for the windows screencap tool
- [Getting markdown to work with editpadpro](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/19.html) -- nice, wish this kind of linking was easier to do on Windows.
- [New Wikicalc beta](http://danbricklin.com/log/2006_04_05.htm#wikicalc095). Just love the idea.
- [Sharpcast to cover all file types](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/sharpcast_synch_all_files.php). Might be worth trying again.
- [DropMyRights](http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/09/13/hidden-microsoft-security-gem/) -- useful, previously blogged.
- [Animated BCS Race](http://www.rockytoptalk.com/story/2006/10/3/61456/9311) -- go bucks
- [Adventures in cablecards](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2006/09/adventures_in_c.html) -- I will wait until football is over before I dip my toes back into this pool.
