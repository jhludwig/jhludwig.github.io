Among other reasons, we've been learning lots of new medical vocabulary in our household: [clostridium difficile](http://www.cdiffsupport.com/aboutcdiff.html), [celiac disease](http://www.celiac.org/), [lymphocytic colitis](http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/collagenouscolitis/), [flagyl](http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/metronidaz.htm), [budesonide](http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/budesonide.htm), not to mention [tamiflu](http://www.tamiflu.com/) and [telithromycin](http://www.centerwatch.com/patient/drugs/dru853.html). Not all this was eventually important to know but it has been an interesting winter.
