I love [google maps](maps.google.com) and [mapquest](www.mapquest.com), but if you are planning a multi-leg road trip -- say for instance visiting 8 colleges and universities over 4 days -- [AAA triptiks](http://www.aaawa.com/maps_resources/triptik.asp) are still pretty darn useful. They make it easy to specify multiple stops, save your plans and try variants, and they print out pretty well. I joined AAA for other reasons, I'm not sure I would pay the fee just for triptiks, but if you are already a member, worth trying.
