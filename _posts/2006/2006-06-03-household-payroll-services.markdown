We're adding a household employee and I need to find a service/software to manage payroll -- cut checks, handle all the tax filings, year end 1040s, etc etc etc. At first glance here is what I am finding:

- [Paycycle](http://www.paycycle.com/) gets a good review in [PCMag](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1962506,00.asp) and is paying to be at the top of google listings
- [Surepayroll](http://www.surepayroll.com/) gets a decent review as well but seems to cost a lot more.
- [ADP](http://www.sbs.adp.com/?source=PPC-GO) has a small business offer but I suspect overkill. Ditto [Peachtree](http://www.peachtree.com/gateway/pps/integration.cfm?gcid=S17597x001-smb_integ&keyword=small%20business%20payroll)
- [Buyerzone](http://www.buyerzone.com/personnel/payroll/qz_questions_265.jhtml) seems to have a lead gen system that will generate quite a few quotes from outsourcing services. Hesitate to try, I don't want a blizzard of annoying email. And there is [supplier-match](http://www.supplier-match.com/content_index.jsp?c=Payroll&su=service%20providers&id=1083957938281003027&partner=personnel/payroll/qz_questions_265.jhtml), they are an affiliate of buyerzone, so I guess I pay two fees effectively to get a referal? crazy.
- I am sure the [quickbooks solution](http://www.payroll.com/) is adequate but I don't really want to install software.
- I am not sure how [10dollarpayroll](http://www.10dollarpayroll.com/) differs from paycycle but anyone who uses the blink tag (or the moral equivalent) in 2006 is off my list.
- [Payrollpayroll](http://www.payrollpayroll.com/index-ppc.html) -- I guess they really really know know their their payroll payroll stuff stuff.

I am sure my accountant can recommend some local service providers too. Has anyone used paycycle?
