I've totally set aside my fiction and general nonfiction reading for a while. I'm totally focused on texts to support my materials science education.

\* "Fundamentals of Microfabrication":amazon by Madou. Great comprehensive overview of the MEMS field, tons of info, tho pretty scattered. A good reference but hard to read. \* "Micromachined Transducers Sourcebook":amazon by Kovacs. Much more readable, but not as current. But a nice job of walking you through the basics. \* "Microsystems Design":amazon by Senturia. So far I find this to be a little less essential than the Kovacs text tho there is some unique content in here. \* "Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction":amazon by Callister. Used in undergrad materials science courses, I am reading this just to refresh myself on the basics. Very readable, I am breezing through it, tho it probably helps that I have seen all the material at least once before.
