Met Kurt today -- [Grimvisions.com](http://www.grimvisions.com/ "Grimvisions.com") -- another Seattle Halloween enthusiast. Some great stuff up here and some stuff I should have thought of -- bending PVC with a heat gun instead of just depending on finding the right fixtures. Also in person Kurt gave me another great pointer -- [Sculpt or Coat](http://spike.pnta.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=SOC) to weatherproof props.
