Need an equation editor for my UW Course. Don't have office installed anymore and so don't have the free one that comes with office. [SourceForge.net: MathCast Equation Editor](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mathcast "SourceForge.net: MathCast Equation Editor") seems to be the leading open source altenative -- also requires [a font package from MIT](http://web.mit.edu/atticus/www/mathml/mit-mathml-fonts-1.0-fc1.msi). Seems a little obtuse but hey I am editing equations so I am swimming in obtuse. I guess OpenOffice has an equation editor too but I don't want to install all that cruft.

[Smarth](http://smarth.sourceforge.net/) is an online alternative but doesn't seem to function that well in Firefox. I really wish google docs would support equations but oh well.
