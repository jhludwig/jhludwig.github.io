Excellent analysis of the fair value of a college atthlete -- [The Sports Economist](http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2006_08_01__arch_file.htm#115669400768460679 "The Sports Economist"), the [Merc](http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/sports/colleges/15372865.htm). Basically, a bunch of adults and other athletes are benefitting from the value created by star football and basketball players on big programs. It is no wonder that we see a constant stream of rules violations given the market value of these players.
