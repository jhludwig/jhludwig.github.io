I hit Rattlesnake ledge this am at 630 -- [Rattlesnake Ledge Hike - a photoset on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/capnqwest/sets/72057594080170357/ "Rattlesnake Ledge Hike - a photoset on Flickr") (not my photos) -- a good wakeup hike. Saw no one on the way up, 2 people at the top, and then passed 40 people on the way down -- it is going to be crowded up there today! Great to hit it while it was still quiet.
