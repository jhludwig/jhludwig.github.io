\* We've got a new version of our website up -- [Ignition Partners — HELPING ENTREPRENEURS SEIZE OPPORTUNITY](http://www.ignitionpartners.com/ "Ignition Partners — HELPING ENTREPRENEURS SEIZE OPPORTUNITY") - way more modern \* and [we expanded our last fund](http://www.ignitionpartners.com/press/ignition_partne.php) \* [Mpire](http://www.mpire.com) [hires a new ceo](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/archives/103748.asp). \* I can't keep up with all the [jobster](http://www.jobster.com) news but [jason's blog is a great place to start](http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2006/06/loving_it.html). Among other things, they've acquired [jobby](http://www.gojobby.com/). \* The [judysbook](http://www.judysbook.com/cities/seattle/) team has done a lot of site upgrading recently too -- looks waaaay better.

I'm way behind honestly on reading ignition portfolio news, I have missed a bunch of stuff...
