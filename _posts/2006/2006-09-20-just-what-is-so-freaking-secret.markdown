I've been thinking about HP's actions -- [A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: "Pretexting"](http://www.theludwigs.com/2006/09/pretexting.html "A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way: "Pretexting"") -- and I've been wondering -- just what is the board of a public company talking about that is so freaking secret? Why do they feel the need to treat a leak like a threat to national security? I really can't wrap my head around this. I wonder why more board meetings aren't open like many government proceedings are. I bet that would put a damper on ceo pay abuses among other board missteps.
