- [Obscure but handy firefox extensions](http://gurge.com/blog/2006/08/29/ten-obscure-yet-handy-firefox-extensions/). I've used several of these, generally good.
- [Ten Windows Apps You Need](http://gurge.com/blog/2006/08/22/ten-windows-apps-you-need/). I can't agree with the Picasa reco, Picasa doesn't seem happy with my photos stored on a remote server. But Notepad2 is awesome, ffdshow is nice, etc.
- [Fineprint raves](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/08/22/fineprint-changes-the-way-youll-use-your-printer/). It doesn't excite me but I guess I should try it for a week
- [Windows Live Writer](http://thebogles.com/blog/2006/08/windows-live-writer/). Phil seems to like. I don't know, I just don't have the time to install software on the 4-6 machines I regularly use.
- [EasyPrototype](http://www.extremeplanner.com/easyprototype/). I could see using this occasionally.
- [Dymo stamps](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1969966,00.asp?kc=PCRSS02129TX1K0000530). I've got a dymo label printer so maybe this is worth trying
