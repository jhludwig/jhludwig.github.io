[jkOnTheRun: LogMeIn buys Hamachi](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2006/08/logmein_buys_ha.html "jkOnTheRun: LogMeIn buys Hamachi") -- a while back I was all excited about remote pc access software, and i still occasionally use it. But increasingly I store all my data in the cloud in various places. OR i completely replicate my really big datasets (like music), and i just don't really get the remote access scenarios anymore.
