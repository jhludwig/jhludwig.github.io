- [Process Library taskmanager plugin](http://www.processlibrary.com/quickaccess/). Just OK. does make it marginally easier to get process info but i had hoped it would pull info right into taskmanager instead of just a generic link icon. and processlibrary hides so much of its info behind a subscription wall. Still I appreciate the effort.
- [Snarf](http://Research.microsoft.com/community/snarf). Seemed intriguing but I just don't retain enough email to make it interesting.
- [Griffin ifill](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/ifill/). Need to try.
- [Gamedrive](http://www.farstone.com/home/ensite/products/gamedrive.shtml). I tried virtual cd drives a couple years ago and gave up, they were too clunky. maybe time to retry.
