[Moore's Lore: new technology. Computing, connectivity, mobile, convergence, communications, software, etc.](http://www.corante.com/mooreslore/20031001.shtml#57395 "Moore's Lore: new technology. Computing, connectivity, mobile, convergence, communications, software, etc.") -- ouch, equates HP of today with Novell at the beginning of the Frankenberg era. Not a good place to be.
