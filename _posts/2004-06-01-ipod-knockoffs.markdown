Rich wants to try some [Ipod knockoffs.](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_gadgets/2004/05/31/ipod_competitor_the_iriver_igp_100.html)  As I commented, my experience with the dell and gateway variants was bad -- terrible UI.  And my kenwood phatdisk in the car has miserable UI too -- I'd have been better off with an IPOD and FM interface.
