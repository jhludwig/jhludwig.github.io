I am sure there are cheaper ways to build a voice transformer -- PC-based software, homebrew circuits -- but I got a [Roland VT-1](http://www.rolandus.com/products/details.asp?catid=15&subcatid=0&prodid=VT%2D1 "Roland US - Products") and I love this box. I predict it has the greatest impact of any single addition to my halloween haunt this year -- I am going to place the output inside the scary tree i built. I'm combining it with some good Bose outdoor speakers so that I get really good fidelity with low noise out of the system. Really worth playing around with, a trial last night had our dogs cowering in the corner of the yard.
