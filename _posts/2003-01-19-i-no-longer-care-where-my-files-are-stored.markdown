**I no longer care where my files are stored**. Dead on -- [0xDECAFBAD: I second that sacrilege](http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000386.phtml). And please make it work across the LAN. In our house, no one knows whether the file is on my machine, my son's, my daughters, my firewire-attached drive, or the file server -- and no one cares to know. Just find the dang thing for me.
