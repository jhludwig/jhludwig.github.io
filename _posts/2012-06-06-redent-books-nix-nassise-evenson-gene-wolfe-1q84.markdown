In order of increasing strangeness.

\* "A confusion of princes":amazon by Garth Nix. YA space opera, kind of reminiscent of the tales of my youth or even back to John Carter books. \* "By the Blood of Heroes":amazon by Joseph Nassise. WWI and zombies. First in a series. Acceptable but there are better zombie books. \* "Immobility":amazon by Brian Evenson. A nearly invulnerable amnesiac wakes up in a post apocalyptic wasteland and tries to deal with the remnants of humanity. Hint: no one is really his friend. \* "The Sorcerer's House":amazon by Gene Wolfe. I last read a Wolfe book maybe 20 years ago and at that time thought "wow he is weird". Well he still is. \* "1Q84":amazon by Haruki Murakami. Childhood sweethearts reunite after 20 years of separation. Oh and she is an assassin, he is involved in a fraud, they're fighting against a religious cult, some very strange supernatural creatures who might be good or incredibly evil are pulling strings, there is an extra moon in the sky, soulless doppelg√§ngers are wandering around, and other strange shit.
