[Scott Hanselman's Computer Zen - Logitech Harmony One Remote Control Review](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LogitechHarmonyOneRemoteControlReview.aspx). -- Nice review of this remote.  It is a pretty good universal remote and I am also pretty happy with.  The one huge problem is lack of bluetooth support to control a PS3 as a DVD player.  But overall a pretty good experience.
