[The Furrygoat Experience - Annoyance: Software Updates](http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=126bcb6b-73d1-4507-9fda-f31398cc14a7 "The Furrygoat Experience - Annoyance: Software Updates") As steve says, updating software sucks, and is one of the reasons I install less and less of it. I'm surprised MSFT hasn't seen the business opportunity here -- they have the scale and infrastructure to handle update delivery and install for all Windows apps -- they should run the update service for all ISVs (and of course charge them a modest fee for the service -- this is worth something to ISVs and users). I'd sure rather have just one updater running on my machine rather than the billions of them that try to run now.
