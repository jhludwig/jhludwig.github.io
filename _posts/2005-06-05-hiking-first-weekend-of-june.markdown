OK we had intended to hit [Rattlesnake Ledge](http://www.washingtonhikes.com/1999/rattlesnake/index2.html) this morning but life got in the way. Perhaps next weekend. Instead I got back out to [Cougar Mountain](http://www.metrokc.gov/gis/vmc/Recreation.htm#CM) for the second time this week. Starting from the RedTown trailhead, i went out on the Wildside trail and then did a counterclockwise loop on the Marshall's Hill/De Leo Wall circuit. A nice circuit, I strongly recommend the counterclockwise direction, or you face a killer trail up the De Leo Wall.

Also I love my [new REI Summit Trekking Poles](http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&catalogId=40000008000&productId=5312&parent_category_rn=0&vcat=REI_SEARCH) -- first poles I've had and man they can really make a difference in stability and speed. Now I'm starting to think about getting [anti-shock poles](http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&catalogId=40000008000&productId=47920372&parent_category_rn=0&vcat=REI_SEARCH) or [ultralights](http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&catalogId=40000008000&productId=47873584&parent_category_rn=0&vcat=REI_SEARCH) . Thanks to [Terry](http://www.dystrick.com/webputty/images/hanold.jpg) for turning me onto these (Hey Terry you need a blog).
