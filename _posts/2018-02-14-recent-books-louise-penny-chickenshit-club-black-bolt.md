- [Still Life](https://www.amazon.com/Still-Life-Inspector-Gamache-Mystery-ebook/dp/B001OLRMZA) by Louise Penny.  Great start to this series, homicide in the Quebec countryside.[![](images/glass-houses-cover-197x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2018/02/recent-books-louise-penny-chickenshit-club-black-bolt/glass-houses-cover/)  I feel like I have read another in this series but can find no evidence of it.
- [Glass Houses](https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Houses-Novel-Inspector-Gamache-ebook/dp/B01N9ZULCJ) by Louise Penny.  And the latest in her series, also excellent.
- [The Chickenshit Club](https://www.amazon.com/Chickenshit-Club-Department-Prosecute-Executives-ebook/dp/B06XBZFQR2) by Jesse Eisinger.  The premise is good and there is some interesting detail in here, but the book loses its way in the detail.   I expected to be angry about corporate crime and lack of consequences after reading this book, but I just felt kind of tired.
- [Black Bolt](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Bolt-Vol-Hard-Time/dp/1302907328) by Saladin Ahmed.  I dip into graphic novels every once in a while to see what is up.  This one got great reviews.  It was just ok for me, a little difficult to relate to the characters or situation.
