OK I originally had some problems with this -- [a little ludwig goes a long way: XP SP2 and Remote Desktop](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001573.html "a little ludwig goes a long way: XP SP2 and Remote Desktop") -- but I was contacted by some very nice guys from MSFT and we walked thru config and usage. The problem seems to have gone away, could have been my misconfiguration, tho I have a niggling feeling not, but whatever, I am working now. Thanks guys.
