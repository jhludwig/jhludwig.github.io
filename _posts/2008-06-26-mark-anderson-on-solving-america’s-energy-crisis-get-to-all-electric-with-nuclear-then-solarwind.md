[Strategic News Service Blog » Blog Archives » Solving America’s Energy Crisis](http://www.tapsns.com/blog/?p=142) -- a reasonable approach. I heartily agree with the idea of getting to all electric as soon as possible. We need an Apollo-like program -- we need the leadership to propose it and to get everyone focused on it. The whole country focused on the July 20 1969 Apollo landing and rallied around it -- we can do the same around the date of the last tanker docking at our shores from overseas.

As I've mentioned to some people -- there will never be a solar embargo, there will never be a solar cartel, the sun isn't controlled by governments inimical to our interests, "peak solar" is billions of years away, and solar production economics are going to follow a Moore's-Law-like curve. What is not to like?
