My winter ass-kicking -- [MSE 565](http://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/mse.html#mse565). Purportedly non-quantitative but the notes from the first lecture dive deep into wave equations. Going to be a tough one.

Removing Fall Quarter class info from my sidebar:

- [EE502 Video](http://www.engr.washington.edu/edge/ee502/ee502vd.html)
- [EE502 Class Page](http://anytime.engr.washington.edu/course/view.php?id=80)

Did fine in this course, aided by my outstanding project team.
