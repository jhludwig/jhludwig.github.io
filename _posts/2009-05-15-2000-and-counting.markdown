I didn't note this yesterday tho many did -- 2000+ days since OSU has last lost to UM, as [the counter on the Dispatch page constantly advises](http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/buckeyextra/dispatch-stories/osufootball.html). Still haven't fully recovered from the shame of the Cooper years but an excellent start. Though the rivalry needs a little more drama if it is to remain the top rivalry in sports.
