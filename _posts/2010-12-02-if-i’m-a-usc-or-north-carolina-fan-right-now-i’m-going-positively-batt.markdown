Taken from "CFN's take on the Cam Newton affair":http://cfn.scout.com/2/1027298.html, man do I agree with this. The NCAA has proven its incompetence. There are differences in the cases, but the USC penalty is SOOO much worse than the Auburn result. The NCAA clearly has no ability to enforce its dip$&!t rules.
