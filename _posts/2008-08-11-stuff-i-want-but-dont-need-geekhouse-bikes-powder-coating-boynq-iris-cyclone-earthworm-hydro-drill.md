\* [Geekhouse Bikes Powder Coating Graphics](http://www.coolhunting.com/archives/2008/08/geekhouse_bikes.php) -- I never ride my bike, but wow could it look cool collecting dust \* Now that I've installed [Edison](http://www.verdiem.com/edison/), let me burn up all my savings with this [dynamic LED keyboard](http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/a85c/) \* [Boynq Iris](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080805/boynq-iris-combines-all-of-your-desktop-gadgetry/) webcam-speaker-light-mic combo. I was just asking myself, where can I get a webcam-speaker-light-mic combo? \* [Cyclone metal cleanup tool](http://toolmonger.com/2008/08/04/cleaning-with-cyclones/). As they say, if only this worked for sawdust \* [Earthworm Hydro Drill](http://toolmonger.com/2008/08/04/earthworm-hydro-drill/). I actually could use this for routing cables for Halloween in the yard, tho it seems like it might be a disaster.
