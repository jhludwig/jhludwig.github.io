[![webgl](images/webgl-300x225.png)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/webgl.png)Playing with [shadertoy](http://www.shadertoy.com), [threejs](http://www.threejs.org), [kineticjs](http://www,kineticjs.com), [chrome experiments](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl/). I can feel my macbook heat up and i can watch the battery drain! Pretty stunning what you can do with webgl.

I am trying to figure out the best practice for integrating webgl with a webpage, in particular text. Overlay of CSS/HTML on a webgl element? Stuffing the text right into the webgl? Does the next version of webgl change anything? What lib to use on top of wegbl to make this easier?

Historical aside -- what a huge missed opportunity for Microsoft, read for instance [Alex St John's story of the early days of really expressive content on the web](http://www.alexstjohn.com/WP/2013/07/25/the-advent-of-web-3d/). Microsoft had a browser code-named Chrome in the 90s that had the idea of webgl built into it. Sadly internal machinations killed it -- political infighting about ownership of graphics leadership within the company, and a lack of vision in senior management -- not enough people were excited about the idea of a browser and web content that brought a PC to its knees, failing to understand that thanks to Moore's Law, this problem would go away within a short time.
