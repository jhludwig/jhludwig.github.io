I'd never seen this before [Creature Supply](http://storea.sprawlingdelusions.com/product_info.php?products_id=33&osCsid=5b61718aae485d5b3f5f5d042073ea3d "Creature Supply") -- records 4 minutes of firing events for 6 output lines, and then replays on receipt of an input trigger (IR, switchmat, etc). Seems useful.
