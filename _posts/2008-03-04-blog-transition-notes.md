Motivated by [Rich](http://www.tongfamily.com/testing_wordpress_bluehost.php), I am finally moving [A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way](http://www.theludwigs.com/ "A Little Ludwig Goes A Long Way") off my own server and onto a hosted service. Back when I started this thing, it was fun to have it on my own box and twiddle directly with the bits. But I am past that, and doing my own MT and OS upgrades has become tiresome.

I am trying out [SiteGround](http://www.SiteGround.com) and [wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com) as my new alternatives. I've duped all my content to a new shadow site, and am tweaking that. Seems to work OK, soon I will flip the domain to point to the new site.
