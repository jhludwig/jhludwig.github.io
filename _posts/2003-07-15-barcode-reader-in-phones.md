Satoshi found [QCode](http://blog.neoteny.com/nakajima/archives/005929.html "Satoshi's Wireless Weblog: User Interface is an Art: QCode is very cool") and is excited about it -- a nice way to pass around digital data on paper. I've thought this seemed like a great idea for a while, tho many barcode schemes have come and gone -- remember the [Cauzin Softstrip](http://www.pcworld.com/howto/article/0,aid,109713,00.asp)? Maybe this one will stick since cameras on phones are nearly ubiquitous and we need something useful to do with them.
