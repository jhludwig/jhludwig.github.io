\* "How To Talk About Books You Haven't Read":amazon by Pierre Bayard. A great treatise on what the act of reading is really about -- how books enter your brain, how they are retained, how they enrich you, how you connect with others about what you've read. If you are a thoughtful reader, this is an excellent book.

\* "Deal Breaker":amazon by Harlan Coben. I am not sure what it says about me that I immediately read a formulaic series thriller after the Bayard. But Coben's books always please. This is the first in his Myron Bolitar series and as good as all the later in the series.
