- [The Library Book](https://www.amazon.com/Library-Book-Susan-Orlean/dp/1476740186/) by Susan Orlean. A peek inside the history, operations, and stories behind the LA Public Library, written by someone who loves books and libraries. Really enjoyable.
- [Rules of Civility](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Civility-Novel-Amor-Towles-ebook/dp/B004IYJDVG) by Amor Towles. Surprisingly fantastic tale of a young woman in Manhattan finding her way in the world pre WWII. Started slow but oh my gosh did it pick up. Inspiring in many ways.
- [The Doubtful Guest](https://www.amazon.com/Doubtful-Guest-Edward-Gorey/dp/0151003130) by Edward Gorey. Just because I needed some weird.
