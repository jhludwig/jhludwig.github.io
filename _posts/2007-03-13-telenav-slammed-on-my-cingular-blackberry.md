A [TeleNav!](http://www.telenav.com/ "TeleNav - Always find your way!") app was slammed on my blackberry today. I didn't ever install it, it just showed up on the homescreen. Basically a kind of spam from cingular I assume.

Anyway i tried it. It wasn't terrible, but I can't see why anyone would bother, the google maps app is so much better. The telenav app is a bit of size/speed pig, it doesn't show traffic data, no satellite views, no white/yellow pages lookup, an annoying upsell ad on the front page. I deleted it.
