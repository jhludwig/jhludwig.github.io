Two handy docs -- [Windows Server command reference](http://channels.lockergnome.com/news/archives/010524.phtml) and [Win XP Command line reference](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx).  Driverquery, msinfo32 -- all kinds of cool stuff in here.
