**Halloween Status**. Got the big fogger system working this weekend -- now I can flood our yard and the street and the neighbor's yard with fog. All the big props in place. All power and [DMX](http://www.usitt.org/DMX/DMX512.htm) control cables in place. Next big work items -- deployment of small props, deployment of x10 control for small electrics, testing of all the above.
