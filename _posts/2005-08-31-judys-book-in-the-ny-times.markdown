Very remiss in noting some of the good press that Judy's Book got in the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/15/technology/15ecom.html  ) -- happened when I was travelling. Nice work guys. Number of postings is growing quickly. (Ignition is an investor in the company)

My favorite Judy's Book game -- be the first to post in a city or area. I've staked out Salt Lake City. Love the maps feature.
