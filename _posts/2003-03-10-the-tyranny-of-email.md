**The Tyranny of Email**. Good read here -- [Critical Section - The Tyranny of Email](http://w-uh.com/articles/030308-tyranny_of_email.html). Another good reason to turn off the blackberry on weekends, and maybe during the week sometime too. The blackberry makes the tyranny pervasive, and that is not a good thing.
