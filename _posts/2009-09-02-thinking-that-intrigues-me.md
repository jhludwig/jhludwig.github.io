\* [Touchable holography](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-P1zZAcPuw). Uses tracking cameras and directed ultrasound to create interaction and physical sensation. Cool demo. \* [Algortihmatic](http://www.algorithmatic.com/) \- online library of algorithms and IDE. Cool tho limited. \* [The LED's dark secret](http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/optoelectronics/the-leds-dark-secret/0). Droop in LED performance to be overcome for broader use. \* [Plasmobots](http://www.physorg.com/news170865567.html) -- "their previous research has already proved the ability of the mould to have computational abilities". \* [Ford Mike Rowe video](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/ford-quality-is-a-dirty-job/). I didn't realize they automatically tracked every single assembly operations through the tools. Fascinating. \* [Brad Feld's open office hours](http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2009/08/community-hours-trying-something-new-for-random-meetings.html). An intriguing idea. Commendable.
