Seems like I ought to learn more about \[removed site\]Â -- lots of smart people are entranced with it: [RasterWeb!](http://rasterweb.net/raster/200408.html#08132004074000 "RasterWeb!"), [Jon Udell](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/08/16.html#a1060), Udell [again](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/08/11.html#a1057).

Update: OK I joined and tried it out. I admire it's simplicity. But...I already have a way that I post links with notes and tags -- that is called my blog. I don't want another site I have to dupe all this effort at. I want something that looks at my blog posts, compares those with posts of others, and gives me the union of all that posting activity -- I guess that is technorati.
