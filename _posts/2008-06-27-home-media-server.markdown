Now that I have a PS3 I want to serve up photos etc to it. Trying to decide between all the choices out there:

\* [Google's new media server](http://desktop.google.com/plugins/i/mediaserver.html?hl=en) \* [Free Media Player Streams iTunes, Syncs Content, Converts Video for iPod, PSP and Xbox 360 - SimpleCenter](http://www.simplecenter.com/) \* WMP 11 of course \* [One man's guide to all the choices out there](http://www.rbgrn.net/blog/2007/06/how-to-set-up-media-servers-for-your-ps3-or-xbox-360.html) \* [Eyeconnect](http://www.elgato.com/elgato/na/mainmenu/products/software/EyeConnect.en.html) seems to be liked on the Mac \* or [Mediatomb](http://mediatomb.cc/)

I have a TON of photos and I need something that will perform well, not clear which of these is the way to go. Time to start experimenting I gues
