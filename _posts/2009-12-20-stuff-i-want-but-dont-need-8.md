- [Toshiba Escargot Vacuum](http://nexus404.com/Blog/2009/07/09/toshiba-escargot-vc-z100l-cyclone-vacuum-cleaner-japanese-collaboration-with-electrolux-really-sucks/). Japan only, boo hoo.
- [The Storyboard book](http://www.thestoryboardbook.com/). Very nice.
- [See-through sink trap](http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/12/see-through_sink_trap_with_clog-cle.html). Not clear that I want to see what is in there but still a cool idea...
- [Design plate challenge](http://www.design21sdn.com/challenges/19). Great looking plates...
- [Wireless HDMI](http://www.gefen.com/kvm/dproduct.jsp?prod_id=4318). Way too expensive, and hate the resolution limit.
