[![](images/4848135998_1ef84a8380_m.jpg "http://www.flickr.com/photos/thartz00/")](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/4848135998_1ef84a8380_m.jpg)OK it is wonderfully fast, the 768G SSD is awesome, Aperture opens in seconds. I love the speed. Love.

But -- one spontaneous reboot. Address Book hangs on first run. The migration utility took forever and silently gave up trying to transfer my music and photos over, I had to do those manually. Had to boot into the repair utility to fix some "strange permission problem":http://osxdaily.com/2011/11/15/repair-user-permissions-in-mac-os-x-lion/. Software Update tool failed updating iTunes twice.

Not conclusive yet but something seems a little off.
