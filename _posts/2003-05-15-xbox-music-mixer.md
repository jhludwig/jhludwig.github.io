Huh, the [xbox.com || musicmixer](http://www.xbox.com/musicmixer/default.htm?det=1&nrmode=published&nroriginalurl=%2fmusicmixer&nrnodeguid=%7b81ab5cb2-db12-4abb-882f-813d5916a025%7d&nrcachehint=guest "xbox.com || musicmixer") is developed by our friends at [WildTangent](http://www.wildtangent.com). Certainly the xbox would be a more fun media receiver than the hp media receiver or the sony box. The description of the xbox product makes it sound like i am going to have to manually copy a bunch of stuff to the xbox, I hope that is not the case.
