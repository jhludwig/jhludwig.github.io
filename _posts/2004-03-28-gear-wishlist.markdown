Random collection of hardware that I'd love to pick up:

\* via [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7301f0b7-385e-49e6-86e7-7da5fb2bb742), the [Quaddisplay](http://www.digitaltigers.com/tigervista-quad.shtml) from Tiger. Beautiful. \* via [PVRBlog](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2004/03/prebuilt_mythtv.html), a [prebuilt MythTV box](http://www.d1.com.au/hmc/) (because I am too lazy to build one myself) \* a [glowing USB mousepad](http://www.gadgetmadness.com/archives/20040325-flexiglow_fx_illuminated_mouse_pad.php) \* via [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/entry/5448992789156435/), a bluetooth wireless surround sound system. I would love to place these around my office and pipe anyone of my PC's sound to them. \* I'm not a Mac user currently but the idea behind the [Sailing Clicker](http://www.gadgets-weblog.com/archives/salling_clicker_review.html) is cool, why can't every phone do this? \* A [Java OS pc from Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product_listing.gsp?cat=132690&path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937%3A86796%3A132690) (via [the register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/36480.html)). I'm not sure why, I guess just to see the current state of a windows alternative. \* The NEC MobilePro 900C mentioned over at [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/entry/7425434787718633/). I'm not sure why, this form factor has always appealed to me. \* A [nano-itx](http://postneo.com/2004/03/19.html#a3327) machine. Continuing the assault on the tower and mini-tower form factors. \* via [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/etymotic_research_mobile_headset.php), the [etymotic earbud](http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/etycom-f.asp). \* OK I can't buy this yet but I love the idea of a [noise-cancelling PC](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/15/2322222) \* and of course, trolling thru the japan importers ([list from Martin](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/000637.html)) always generates a list of things i want to have.

As with software, I just don't have time to try all this stuff. Installation and config is so time consuming. If these guys all want me to continue to be a healthy consumer of gadget gear, they better be hammering on integration and config features. I want devices that autorecognize all the crap i already have, slot themselves in nicely, grab the right state data from my existing config automagically, and require absolutely minimal cabling.
