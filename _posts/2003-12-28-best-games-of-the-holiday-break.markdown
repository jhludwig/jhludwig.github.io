We've played a lot of games over the holiday. Our grades:  
  
[Call Of Duty](http://www.callofduty.com/index.asp "Activision: Call Of Duty"): A+. Multiplayer incredibly fun, servers easy to connect to, firewalls not a problem. The only real beef is the stupid bunny-hopping behaviour that some players adopt to avoid incoming fire.  
  
[Counterstrike](http://www.valvesoftware.com/): A-. Great multiplayer gameplay. But aged graphics, ridiculously painful downloading required to get up and going, and confusing game lobby behaviour.  
  
[Halo for PC](http://www.microsoft.com/games/halo/). B+. Fun, not a bad way to spend time. But just doesn't seem to have the same addictiveness of Call of Duty or Counterstrike.  
  
[SSX 3](http://www.easportsbig.com/games/ssx3/home.jsp). B+. OK we are suckers for snowboarding games. This is a reasonable next version of the SSX line.  
  
[XIII](http://www.xiii-thegame.com/uk/virtualtour/). C+. A great idea and a good story line. But incredibly stupid save game behaviour makes the single player missions painful -- needless repetition of solved missions is no substitute for real challenge. Oh and the end of level bosses are juvenile, making the game feel like a Mario title.  
  
[Hidden and Dangerous 2](http://www.hidden-and-dangerous.com/hd2/index.aspx?bhcp=1). C-. A nice looking game, but so realistic that the fun is sapped out of it. Yes I am sure a single shot from that gun would really take me out of commission, but a fun game needs to be a little more forgiving.
