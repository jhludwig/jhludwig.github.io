OK I know OSU played a game last weekend but really, the season starts this weekend. Here is my prereading:

\* The [Columbus Dispatch](http://www.buckeyextra.com/) site of course. Most of their stuff is posted daily first thing in the morning. \* [Tressel's World.](http://tresselsworld.blogspot.com/) M-rated, definitely not for the kiddies, and may piss off some OSU fans, but I find it freaking hilarious. \* [Austin American-Statesman](http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/longhorns/index.html) for the Texas view. \* Longhorn blogs - [bevosports](http://www.bevosports.com/), [Burnt Orange Nation](http://www.burntorangenation.com/) \* [Every Day Should Be Saturday](http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/) for general college football goodness \* And [M Go Blog](http://mgoblog.blogspot.com/) to get just generally pissed off at Michigan, because it doesn't matter who we are playing, "F@$% Michigan" is still a good sentiment.
