[Marginal Revolution: The Return of the Zombie](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/08/the-return-of-t.html): _"The Congressional Budget Office [estimates](http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/96xx/doc9649/08-20-SocialSecurityUpdate.pdf) that there is only a 7% probability that someone born in 2000 will receive their Social Security benefits as promised today"_

I don't think anyone in the family is confused about this but in case you are...
