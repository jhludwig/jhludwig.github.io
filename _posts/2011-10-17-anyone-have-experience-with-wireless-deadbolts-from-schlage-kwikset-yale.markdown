[![](images/b55cf51a3945b850d8351555b30d6da9.jpg "Deadbolt")](http://www.gokeyless.com/product/720/2/schlage-be365ply613-keypad-deadbolt-lock)I'm going to try out a wireless deadbolt so that I can remotely manage and track access to a location. There are offerings from Yale (for instance [this Yale deadbolt](http://www.yaleresidential.com/en/yale/yale-USA/Real-Living/product-details/Keypad/Keypad1/)), Schlage ([this deadbolt](http://link.schlage.com/Products/Pages/DeadboltStarterKit.aspx)), and Kwikset. I am trying to understand the pricing and features of their remote access choices. Schlage seems to want $8.99 a month for remote access which makes me unhappy. The Yale product works with a [Vera2 controller](http://www.gokeyless.com/product/748/5/micasaverde-vera2-zwave-home-automation-system) and seems to offer free monthly basic services, tho it seems like this controller might work with the Schlage as well?

Anybody have a positive or negative experience with any of these? I also wonder a lot about security of course, worried about creating a huge risky backdoor into the location.
