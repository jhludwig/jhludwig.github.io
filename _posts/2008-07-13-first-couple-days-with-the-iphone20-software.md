After [activation woes](http://theludwigs.com/2008/07/iphone-servers-crumble-under-activation-strain/), the experience has been pretty good. The things I like:

\* The [Exchange](http://www.microsoft.com/exchange "Microsoft Exchange Server") support. Wasn't completely obvious how to enable. You have to delete your old imap/webdav email account info, and create a new Exchange account type, and turn on the cal and contact synching. It will wipe all your on-device cal and contact info so sync up first! Getting the entourage/ical sync disaster out of my config is a very good thing. \* The App store. nice selection, a lot of good choices, and seems to work well. Apps I like so far: \*\* Urbanspoon. The interface is just cool \*\* GuitarToolkit. Chord reference and tuner, very nice \*\* Todo. Integrates nicely with [RememberTheMilk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com) for a complete app and website experience. Jott is great too with the nice voice interface but Todo wins for the rememberthemilk integration \*\* SmugShot. Replaces the iPhone camera and photo apps, and is integrated with [SmugMug](http://www.smugmug.com)

Things that aren't doing it for me:

\* What is the new Contacts app for? Seems like a subset of the phone app \* The Google app. Not really clear what value this adds beyond the existing search in Safari \* Games. They look nice but the interface limitations of the device really hurt. I won't get rid of my DS. \* Still no cut and paste?? Am I missing this somewhere?
