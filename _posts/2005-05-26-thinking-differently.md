From [JK On The Run](http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2005/05/how_to_think_di.html), hints [on how to think differently](http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2005/05/18.html#a1150). I like _"Learning Something Outside Your Comfort Zone: If you're an artist, learn about String Theory. If you're a scientist, learn about the aesthetics of music. The more novel and uncomfortable and strange it is, the more it will liberate your calcified brain."_
