All these great packages and I haven't tried a one. Why? I am a huge consumer of software and am generally willing to install anything. The impediment is state management. Increasingly I use 5-6 machines interchangeably on a regular basis -- 2 at work thru a KVM, 3 or 4 at home in different places, and public machines at other workplaces, hotels, etc. It is not helpful to have an app installed on just one machine -- and it is too time consuming to install it on all. Really I want to install stuff just once, on my webserver, and have it be available on any machine that I work from. I am a bleeding edge PC user but I think this is going to become a more prevalent issue for all consumers...
