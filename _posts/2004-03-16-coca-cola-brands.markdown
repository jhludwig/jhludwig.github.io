I was reading the [Coca-Cola annual report](http://ir.thecoca-colacompany.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=94566&p=irol-reports) tonight. What was most interesting to me was the partial list of all the brands they have worldwide.

\* _Diet Pop_. Now that is marketing magic. Ditto _187168_. \* _Bimbo Break_. I guess we know the target market for that one. \* _Diet Almdudler, Drim, Tuborg Squash_. Now don't those sound refreshing? \* _Beat, Burn, Hit, Shock,_ and _Slap_. For the masochists in the crowd. \* I knew about _Dr. Pepper_ and _Mr. Pibb_, but did you know about their buddies _Disney Winnie the Pooh, Fraser & Neave, Master Chill, Master Pour, Mickey Mouse, Pepe Rico_, the _Pocket Dr._, the _Robinson Brothers_, _Samantha_, and the _Thextons_? \* _Chivalry_ and _Neverfail_ sound very uplifting. \* Combine _Ripe N Ready_ and _Love Body_, which via a _Wink_, leads to an _Urge_, and then _Joy_ -- but don't forget _Safety First_. \* _Chaudfontaine, Diet Inka Kola, Guarana Jesus, Jurassic Well, Sparletta Iron Brew, Water Salad_. No idea what these are, but I'd buy a can of any of them in a second.
