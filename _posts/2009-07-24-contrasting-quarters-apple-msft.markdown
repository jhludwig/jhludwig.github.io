Apple's quarter ([NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/technology/companies/22apple.html?_r=1&scp=7&sq=apple%20earnings&st=cse)): "We're making our most innovative products ever and our customers are responding"..."unexpectedly strong sales of Macintosh computers and a surge in iPhone purchases pushed Apple's profit up 15 percent in the third quarter"..."PC shipments for the industry fell 3 to 5 percent over the last three months. But Apple said it sold 2.6 million Macs in the quarter, up about 18 percent from the 2.2 million it sold in the previous quarter"..."overall gross profit margin grew to 36.3 percent, from 34.8 percent in the year-ago quarter"..."Revenue rose to $8.34 billion, from $7.46 billion last year".

MSFT's quarter ([NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/technology/companies/24soft.html?scp=2&sq=microsoft&st=cse)): "has been humbled, both by the recession and by problems of its own making"..."Year-over-year revenue and full-year sales of Microsoft's flagship Windows software dropped for the first time"..."29 percent drop in net income"..."17 percent drop in quarterly revenue"..."warned that people should not expect a major bounce-back in technology spending when the economy recovers."

Hmm. Apparently the economic downturn is worse among PC buyers than among non-PC buyers.
