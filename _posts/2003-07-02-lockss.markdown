Saw a reference to [Lockss](http://lockss.stanford.edu/ "Lockss Web Site") in the recent [Economist](http://www.economist.com) tech review. Its basic mission:

_"let us save what remains: not by vaults and locks which fence them from the public eye and use in consigning them to the waste of time, but by such a multiplication of copies, as shall place them beyond the reach of accident." -- Thomas Jefferson_

All well and good for libraries, but I need this for all my personal stuff too. I wish I had a dead simple way for instance of replicating all my digital photos to 3-4 different places, so that I was never at risk of losing them.
