OK the last 6 weeks have been personally...complex...but I have managed to read a few things.

\* "Gallipoli by Alan Moorehead":amazon. Good (but not great) picture of warfare. The primitive communications technology, primitive logistics, byzantine command structure -- all led to disaster. Personally, I find "Black Hawk Down":amazon and "The Red Badge of Courage":amazon to be more memorable, impactful, but this is still a compelling book. \* "Knife of Dreams by Robert Jordan":amazon. I keep torturing myself with this series. Something about the inventiveness behind the core characters and society has me hooked. Certainly not the pacing of the story or the writing. The pacing is better in this installment but still slower than it should be.

Oh and here is a [great compendium of Best Of lists for the year](http://www.fimoculous.com/year-review-2005.cfm) -- books and more.
