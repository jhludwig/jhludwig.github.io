\* [Great Jobster momentum](http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2005/06/momentum.html) -- man this is a great and fun team. I am proud that Ignition is involved with them. \* [Tim Dowling](http://timgdowling.typepad.com) of [Pure Networks](http://www.purenetworks.com) has a blog now... \* Martin blogs on [the morphing of allconsuming](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/05/bravo_new_all_c.html) (I'm a sucker for anything about books) and [energy independence](http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2005/06/two_important_r.html) \* Phil has found some greasemonkey-like plugins for IE -- [trixie](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/06/trixie-greasemonkey-for-ie.html), [turnabout](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/06/turnabout-open-source-plugin-for-ie.html). I have converted so totally to firefox, it is hard to find the time to go back and try these out. I would love a realtime CSS viewer/editor plugin for IE, like some of the web developer plugins for firefox. One probably exists. \* Rich on [digicam reviews](http://www.tongfamily.com//2005/06/01/best_digicams.html) [and GPSs for biking](http://www.tongfamily.com/biking/components/2005/06/07/garmin_etrex_vista_color_and_legend_color.html) -- I too need a GOS tho for hiking. Some requirements are same -- durability, weather proof, low weight -- but some are different -- topo maps, trail maps. \* Rich on [the gayot guide for restaurants](http://www.tongfamily.com/travel/seattle/2005/06/01/guyot_restaurant_reviews.html) and his [remembrances of Chez Shea](http://www.tongfamily.com/travel/seattle/2005/06/01/chez_shea.html) -- for me, Place Pigalle at the market has the same great memories associated with it.
