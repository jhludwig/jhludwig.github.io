Good read -- [Amazon.com: Books: Justice Hall](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553581112/qid=1058146509/sr=8-5/ref=sr_8_5/002-5782222-4497647?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Justice Hall") -- the latest in a series involving Sherlock Holmes in his later years, now married. A little deeper and more modern characterization than I remember from the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle works.
