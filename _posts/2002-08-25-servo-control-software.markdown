**Servo Control Software**. Lots of good discussion on the MOM site about servo control software. [Robo-Ware Robotics Servo Control Software](http://www.rentron.com/Robo-Ware.htm) is recommended, supports downloads to basic stamps. [Visual Servo Automation - Overview - The Solution for Mini-SSC Servo Control Software](http://www.brookshiresoftware.com/overview.htm) gets a lot of recommendations too but no download to basic stamps, you need to keep the PC in the picture.
