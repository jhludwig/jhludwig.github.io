Been reading thru a bunch of guidebooks on France. The Lone[ly Planet](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/174059343X/qid=1068619905//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl14/002-5880129-3574433?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) series seems to resonate the most with me -- good detail, very evocative, seems to talk about the things I want to hear about -- a good mix of typical touristy stuff plus some outdoors activities. The [Michelin guides](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/2060000297/qid=1068620053/sr=1-10/ref=sr_1_10/002-5880129-3574433?v=glance&s=books) are certainly detailed but I don't know, everything starts to blur together, not evocative at all. They might be the guides to carry around tho.
