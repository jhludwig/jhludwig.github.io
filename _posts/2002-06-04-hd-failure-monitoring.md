**HD Failure Monitoring**. This [tool](http://www.panterasoft.com/) will monitor your hard drives and warn you of potential failures via e-mail or "instant" messages. -- "The program uses Self-Monitoring and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) built into all newer hard disks, and can predict problems with your hard drive(s)."
