- [The Clockwork Dynasty](https://www.amazon.com/Clockwork-Dynasty-Daniel-H-Wilson-ebook/dp/B01LXFO711) by Daniel H. Wilson. Fun story about automatons who have been hiding within human society for eons, and their struggle to understand their own morality and purpose. I'm not sure it is a 4.5 star read but I was entertained.
- [Radical Uncertainty](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Uncertainty-Decision-Making-Beyond-Numbers-ebook/dp/B07TJ1YW3Q) by John Kay and Mervyn King. A little academic but I still loved it. Our mania for models and planning is all for naught in a world swept by health care crises, climate crises, social crises, financial crises. We need to continually focus on what is going on underneath the numbers, and invest in resiliency to make it through the shifts and shocks. Good read.
- [Good Economics for Hard Times](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Economics-Times-Abhijit-Banerjee-ebook/dp/B07PCQLKSS) by Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo. Interesting discussions but not as foundational as Radical Uncertainty.
