OK here are some of the highlights from the remainder of our trip:

\* Isola bella on lake maggiore. Previously blogged. Beautiful and the lake seems way cleaner than lake como. If we went back to this part of the world I think we'd stay on lake maggiore instead of como. \* Florence. My initial impression was ?gosh this is a butt ugly city". But it grew on us -- the beauty is clearly not in the streets but in the art, culture, interiors of buildings, etc. And it is a very manageable size. \* The [Uffizi](http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/) was much more to my liking than the Louvre -- a manageable size, and I just prefer the style of painting. And of course [David](http://www.sbas.firenze.it/accademia/) was just amazing. I just didn't understand the scale at which these artists operated -- when you see the size of the works and the level of detail, it is just amazing. I know, my fine arts education is woefully lacking, I am discovering all this somewhat late in life. \* Venice was of course beautiful, we didn't have enough time there. We had one really great meal there at [Osteria Oliva Nera](http://www.ed.cl/0210/0403.htm), a family run place. \* Milan. Everyone told us ?ugly, no point in visiting?. But in many ways I liked even better than Florence and Venice. Florence and venice are ?cities in amber? -- frozen in time, operated for the benefit of tourists. Milan is a living breathing city, I like a living vibrant city. \* [Ferrari museum](http://www.galleria.ferrari.com/) out in modena. Man this place is like a shrine. A huge number of "pilgrims" visiting, getting their picture taken with the Enzo on display. What a car.
