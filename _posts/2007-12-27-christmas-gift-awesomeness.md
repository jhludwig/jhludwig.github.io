\* The "Kindle":amazon is awesome. The awesomeness is due to the wireless delivery of books. And the fact that I can browse Amazon at my PC and direct books to my Kindle with one click. (Similarly, the Unbox/Tivo integration is awesome for the same reason -- Amazon is silently building a great asset here). The book selection is soooo much broader than that for the Sony Reader. \* [Call of Duty 4](http://www.callofduty.com/) is awesome. the ranking/challenge system keeps you engaged. Haven't cracked the UT box yet, so entranced with COD4 -- must get to 5-star general. \* Stupid little RC helicopters that we got are fun. Available from lots of vendors. Pretty uncontrollable, watch out lamps!

Everything else is awesome too! I will blog it all in the fullness of time.
