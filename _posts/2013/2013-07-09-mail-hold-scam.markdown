title: "Mail Hold Scam"

So we haven't received mail for about a week and I stopped at the post office, a 1 month temporary vacation hold was placed on our mail. The hold was placed at the USPS website, anyone can do this, there is no security. They had my name and address correct tho they supplied a NYC cell phone number as a contact number. Or maybe it was just a random number.

So I am trying to figure out if this is some sort of scam, was someone intending to pick up my mail (because no valid ID was demanded to pick it up), or were they planning on having it redelivered somewhere (tho the hold order had it being delivered at the end of the month to my address)?

Or was this just a db error at the post office?

I don't seem to find anything on the internet about vacation mail hold scams but very curious.
