I recently left my Kindle on a plane, and now I have to get a new one (or migrate to ipad or whatever, the device used is not the point).

I've purchased 515 books over the years and read many of them. It is a disaster getting just my unread or currently-reading books over to a new device. The "Manage your Kindle" web page has no indication of read status, I have to go through each title and figure out what to do with it. And I can't group or organize on the webpage at all. A really terrible experience. And hasn't improved in years. Amazon has done nothing for the core Kindle market, people that actually read a lot of books.

Annoyed. Wasting my time, Amazon.
