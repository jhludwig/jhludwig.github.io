title: "Confused about which Hadoop distribution to use"

Playing around with Hadoop a little and I am completely confused about where to start:

- [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org).
- [Hortonworks](http://hortonworks.com/download/).
- [Cloudera](http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products/cdh.html).
- Pivotal. Not yet available publicly but early access program available
- [Intel](http://hadoop.intel.com). Probably the standard licensing restrictions on Intel software, probably not viable.
- AWS. Except I want to host locally.
- And yet more [distributions](http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Distributions%20and%20Commercial%20Support).

More confusing than choosing a linux distro.
