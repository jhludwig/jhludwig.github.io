So [Minnesota fired Tubby](http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/9096499/minnesota-gophers-dismiss-tubby-smith-day-ncaa-tourney-ouster). [@MedcalfByESPN](https://twitter.com/MedcalfByESPN) is pretty clear that the real problem lies within the Minnesota athletic program and community -- failure to build facilities, failure to support program, etc:

> That's the truth. Gophers need to invest a lot of money to right the ship. I'm gone. Feel free to disagree.

> You can get lost in Minneapolis. When the Gophers are good, everyone cares. When they're not, they go away. That's just how it is.

> The Gophers need so many additional resources to compete with the best teams in the Big Ten and the country. Limited investment.

Pretty classic mediocre team problem. The institution thinks it is a premier program, and thinks it deserves premier people and premier results. The truth is different.
