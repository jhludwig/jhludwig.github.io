[![win8](images/win8-155x300.png)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/win8.png) This thing is stuck on my desktop, on the left side of the screen. No matter what I do, it won't go away. Persists when I maximize and minimize windows, when I bring up the metro interface or any metro app. Not just a classic desktop phenomenon.

Oh and this is a machine without a touchscreen. I can't follow its directions. Mousing over it, clicking on it doesn't do anything. Ok well actually the arrow animates.

When I try to bring up a context menu on an icon near it, this tip overlay is on top of the context menu. It wants to be the boss, dammit!

I presume it will disappear on reboot.
