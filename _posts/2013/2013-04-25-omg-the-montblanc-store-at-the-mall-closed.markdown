[![http://www.flickr.com/photos/kusabi/](images/montblanc.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/montblanc.jpg)Where am I going to buy $500 pens now? I'm devastated.

I hope they open [a cupcake shop](http://theludwigs.com/2012/02/how-many-cupcakes-do-they-expect-us-to-eat/) in the spot, we need more of those.
