In all my playing around with arduinos and raspberrypis, I haven't really gotten into wearables. But for some reason this [color sensor](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1356) just seems totally cool. And then I get drawn to the [lux sensor](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1246) and the [GPS module](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1059) and [accelerometer](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1247) and well just about all of it. I don't really have a great idea what to do with it -- maybe tie it into OneBusAway and have something light up with the bus is near, time and gps wise?
