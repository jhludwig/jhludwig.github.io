The [reviews of this thing have been pretty tepid](http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-cameras/sony-cyber-shot-dsc/4505-6501_7-35827131.html). And if you review this thing as a competitor to a point and shoot, the reviews are right -- this is a pretty funky/bad point and shoot. Clumsy to handle, poor UI, hooking this onto your phone feels downright clumsy and bizarre.

But the concept is super intriguing, though not as a point and shoot replacement. But the ability to mount the lens in one location and control from another is very cool. There are scenarios where I would love this. GoPro scenarios. Events. I have to noodle on.

One thing they have to fix is the horrible custom SSID thing. That is just terrible. Because it means my iPad or iPhone can't simultaneously connect over wifi to the internet. It should either connect over bluetooth or use an available wifi network.
