Random things I've stumbled on in the last week, and that I am sure I will need to know again.

- [...permanently delete some files from Github?](https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data) Like when you check in something to the wrong project accidentally.
- [...temporarily show a localhost web service to someone?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6080048) Horribly dangerous but sometimes useful.
- [...peek inside really big files from the command line?](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/07/15/unix-commands-for-data-science/) Nothing earth shattering here, I just forget to use these tools.
- [...edit Python code?](http://andrewbrookins.com/tech/one-year-later-an-epic-review-of-pycharm-2-7-from-a-vim-users-perspective/) Pycharm worth a look.
- [...structure a flask application?](http://mattupstate.com/python/2013/06/26/how-i-structure-my-flask-applications.html) One man's opinion.
- [...use ansible to modify a file or install a package or whatever?](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/modules.html#contents) All the modules are listed here.
- ...use [graphviz to make a certain graph](http://www.graphviz.org/Gallery.php) or a [certain shape node](http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes)?
- [...build a python command line?](https://github.com/Birdback/manage.py) Seems less obtuse than some of the solutions I've looked at.
- [...pick a messageq framework to use?](http://x-aeon.com/wp/2013/04/10/a-quick-message-queue-benchmark-activemq-rabbitmq-hornetq-qpid-apollo/) No idea but this post suggests that perf differences are dramatic.
- [...snapshot vagrant boxes?](https://github.com/dergachev/vagrant-vbox-snapshot) Very handy if you are trying out a lot of config options.
- [...install packages from other repositories on CentOS?](http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories)
