However you feel about Snowden's actions, whether he is a patriot or traitor, brilliant or naive, you have to give him credit for having the balls to take a stand. [![http://www.flickr.com/photos/insouciance/](images/bunnyhat.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bunnyhat.jpg)He has put his life and liberty at risk for something he believes in. He has thrown away his career, his relationships, his home, everything. I'm not completely sure how I feel about all his actions, though I have a strong bias towards more openness and more government accountability and more transparent oversight. But I certainly admire his courage.

Contrast with [members of Congress who apparently were afraid to break a subcommittee rule.](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2013/06/intelligence-committee-wyden-snowden-came.php) Gosh, what happens if you break a subcommittee rule, do you have to sit at the wrong table at lunch, or do you lose your parking pass, or do you have to wear a funny hat on Thursdays? It must be horrific.
