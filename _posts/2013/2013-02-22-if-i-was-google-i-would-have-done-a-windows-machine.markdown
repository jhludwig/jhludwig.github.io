[![pixel](images/pixel.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pixel.jpg)So the new "Chromebook Pixel":http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/02/chromebook-pixel/ is out, and it is an interesting move. Nice hardware, but expensive, and of course limited to whatever software runs on Chrome.

Being the "proud" owner of a Surface RT -- another nice piece of hardware limited by its software -- I'm not betting that this is going to be a big seller.

If I was Google, I would have built a Windows machine with great Google service integration and a Google/Chrome alternative to the new Win8 interface

\* PC OEMs are not doing an amazing job on building machines, the field seems wide open \* One less thing to explain to users -- it is a Windows machine, it runs all Windows software if you want to, no need to explain Chrome \* Probably easier to get wide distribution -- it is just a great Windows machine \* Users have to deal with a new interface on Win8 anyway -- the time is ripe to offer something that is different than Metro (and maybe supports the classic Windows look better) \* It would befuddle Microsoft. They can't hate or attack a Windows machine.

I'll never buy a Chromebook. I'd think about a great Windows PC with great Google integration.
