[![http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikelove/](images/chips-300x225.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/chips.jpg)Crap there are too many choices. [XDA dev](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=2537) has somewhat popular options for the ATT G2

- Cleanrom is the most popular and scrapes off all the AT&T goo while leaving LG goo. This seems like a reasonable approach
- AEON is second most popular but man the pages feel sketchy.
- Basic rom is the third choice and seems to wipe off AT&T and LG cruft.

Then there is some Korean derivative and a stock AT&T rom that has been rooted.

This is probably all going to turn into a chocolate mess. Don't be surprised if you call me or text me and never hear back.

UPDATE: Ok I am working first on rooting the phone. This is so obvious:

- Go to Settings, General, About Phone, Software Information, and whale away on "Build Number" until developer mode unlocks. Crappiest easter egg ever.
- Back to Settings...General...Developer Options and turn on USB Debugging.
- On your PC, download the LG drivers from [the LG support web site](http://www.lg.com/us/support/software-manuals).
- Hook up the phone to the pc
- [download the ioroot package](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2448887) pointed to by the xda forums

OK so I guess I am rooted now. Yay. Geek merit badge partially redeemed.
