- [Disappearing Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-Earth-novel-Julia-Phillips-ebook/dp/B07H72JM68) by Julia Phillips. I have read 0 books set in Kamchatka, an interesting look into the lives of isolated and distressed women on the peninsula.
- [Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538873-mr-penumbra-s-24-hour-bookstore) by Robin Sloan. Just OK. Fun precept but characters were less than 2 dimensional.
- [House of the Rising Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25205414-house-of-the-rising-sun) by James Lee Burke. Haven't ever read a Burke. Western with archetype characters and a lot of action. Fun but probably not meaningful.
- [The Spinoza Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12715691-the-spinoza-problem) by Irvin Yalom. Huh I knew nothing of Spinoza sadly, this was a very interesting fictionalized introduction to him and his thinking.
