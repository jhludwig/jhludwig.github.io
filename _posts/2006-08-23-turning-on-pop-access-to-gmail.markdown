Spent time today helping a friend do this...the google site is pretty good, but doesn't really give guidance on what to do if your pop client keeps getting rejected. google has a [anti-robot test](https://www.google.com/accounts/UnlockCaptcha) you need to complete involving a captcha. perhaps this is just for new gmail accounts.
