A large selection of fonts for halloween -- [Bloody Fonts](http://www.goblinville.com/fonts/bloody.htm "Bloody Fonts"). Recommended use is to for templates for tombstone lettering, etc. Tho I found some really nice stencils at Michael's last year that were supposed to look like logs and sticks but looked a lot like femurs and tibulas.
