**Image Selection Tool**. Gleaned from [Clay Shirky's](http://www.shirky.com/) newsletter, [Image Selection Tool](http://www.imageselectiontool.com/) has some really interesting ideas (tho the worst name imaginable?). The idea of melding storylines and storytelling with pictures is very interesting.
