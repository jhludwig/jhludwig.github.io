For all my Ohio friends, some links to get you ready for the game this weekend:

\* [University of Washington Huskies sports: news, scores and features | Seattle Times Newspaper](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/huskies/ "University of Washington Huskies sports: news, scores and features | Seattle Times Newspaper") -- Seattle Times main page. Lewis is Pac-10 defensive player of the week, Willingham thinks this is his fastest team yet out here. \* [Seattle Times sports blog.](http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/huskyfootball/). Still tickets available \* [Husky forums](http://forums.seattletimes.nwsource.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=19895&sid=c392721625bdb296952166dd30a4e216). Very gentile, lots of "thank yous" and "nice post". No one casting any aspersions about inbreeding, deviant sexual behaviour, etc \* [PI Homepage](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/cfootball/). Nice compact page. Locker jerseys are selling fast; huskies doing well on turnover margin (unlike the buckeyes) \* [PI blog](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/huskiesfb/). The Huskies look good re injuries, everyone looks ready to go \* [Huskies fanblog](http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/huskiesfan/)

Should be fun!
