In this year's battle of one-off kitchen tools: The [SlotDog](http://www.slotdog.com/) kind of smashes your hotdog, but it does seem to work, the hotdogs are attractive and tasty. The [watermelon slicer](https://www.amazon.com/Watermelon-Slicer-Corer-Server-STAINLESS/dp/B01AV1WVNG) is pretty erratic, it mostly just smashes your watermelon and produces a lot of oddly shaped pieces and juice. A sharp knife is a much better tool.
