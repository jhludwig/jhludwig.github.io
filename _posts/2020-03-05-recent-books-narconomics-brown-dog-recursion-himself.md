- [Narconomics](https://www.amazon.com/Narconomics-How-Run-Drug-Cartel/dp/1610397703) by Tom Wainwright. They may be criminals, but they have all the same economics and behaviours of commercial enterprises. Good insight into why attempting to eradicate narcotics at the source is such a waste of time.
- [Brown Dog](https://www.amazon.com/Brown-Dog-Jim-Harrison-ebook/dp/B00CIWZ7LU) by Jim Harrison.  Great character, great writing.  How has this never been turned in a tv series?  Fargo-style stories in the Upper Peninsula.
- [Recursion](https://www.amazon.com/Recursion-Novel-Blake-Crouch-ebook/dp/B07HDSHP7N) by Blake Crouch.  Nice time-travel romp, well reviewed.  I am not sure it quite lives up to the reviews but still a solid tale.
- [Himself](https://www.amazon.com/Himself-Novel-Jess-Kidd/dp/1501145185) by Jess Kidd.  An orphan returns to his home town to uncover the truth around his parents, with a healthy assist from townspeople and ghosts.
