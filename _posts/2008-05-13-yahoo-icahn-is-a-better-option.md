OK Yahoo could have been a Microsoft division, all of Microsoft's internet ambitions would have been handed over to them, they would have been able to run semi-autonomously.

Or they can be [ripped apart by private equity guys like Icahn](http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/Y/YAHOO_ICAHN?SITE=WIRE&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2008-05-13-17-29-00) -- massive layoffs, milking their current traffic levels for cash flow, spinning off parts.

This is preferable? Did Yahoo management not foresee this??
