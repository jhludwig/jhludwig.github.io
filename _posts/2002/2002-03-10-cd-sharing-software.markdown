**CD Sharing Software**

One great use for a cheap NAS that [Rich](http://www.tongfamily.com/weblog/) has been talking about creating is to create a virtual CD Jukebox. I wonder how well [this software](http://www.mediapathtech.com/zdefault.htm) works.

Update -- a better list of potential software up on [download.com](http://www.download.com) when you search for virtual cd. [Virtualdrive](http://www.farstone.com/home/en/html/productsvdn.htm) seems like an interesting commercial software option.
