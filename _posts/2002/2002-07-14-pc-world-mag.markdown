**PC World Mag**. Haven't read this in a long time but picked it up on a lark. Hey it was actually useful. [Six Degrees](http://www.creo.com/sixdegrees/) seems like something I should try, tho with my aggressive email deletion policy I wonder if it will do much for me. The utilities on the [download section](http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/collection/0,collid,1210,00.asp) seem interesting -- filemon, regmon, registry drill, bugtoaster, commview. [DriverGuide](http://www.driverguide.com/) seems like a good place to go to get drivers for old hardware like my NEC Z1. [Annoyances.org](http://annoyances.org/) seems like a good forum for Windows issues. And [\[H\]ard|OCP](http://www.hardocp.com/) seems like yet another good site for PC tweaking.
