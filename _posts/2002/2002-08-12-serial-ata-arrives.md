**Serial ATA Arrives**. Article from [Tom's Hardware Guide](http://www.tomshardware.com/storage/02q3/020812/index.html). Anyone who has ever tried to add an IDE device will be happy about this. I will certainly demand serial ATA on my next PC. Not sure it is worth retrofitting existing boxes but I will consider.
