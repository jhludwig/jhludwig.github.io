**Coins** I'm getting hooked on ebay again. Not buying so much, as just watching the action. I purchased some SLC Olympic coinage from the [US Mint](http://catalog.usmint.gov/wcs/wcs_command/0,,cginame_a=CategoryDisplay&querystring=cgnbr;4080+cgmenbr;1000+parentCategory;+nextCategory;+prevCategory;,00.html), and now I am watching all the [Olympic Coin auctions](http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&ht=1&SortProperty=MetaEndSort&query=olympic+coins) on ebay. Lots of fun.

I used to collect coins as a kid and I still have the 76 Olympic Silver Dollar I bought up in Parry Sound that year. I guess I am kind of restarting my Olympic coin collection.
