**The Outback Bowl**

From my Dad, today's guest blogger:

"Whoa! What a second half and a fantastic fourth quarter! We were glued to our seats for the entire game!(after the first half---there were some who wanted to leave!) We prefer to think that Ohio State lost the first half 14 to zip...but won the second half 28 to 17! The team played well but our offensive coordinator needs a little work. We expected them to go for the bomb on the last few seconds of the ball game...not with so much time left on the clock.....in my opinion the coaches got lost in the excitement of the game amd lost site of their objective. We would of preferred overtime to this ending! Oh well...there are many fans who believe Tressel will really make his presence felt in the oncoming years!"
