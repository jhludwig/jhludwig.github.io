**Oregon Trip**. We're back. Had a great time in [Cannon Beach](http://www.cannon-beach.net/) at the [Stephanie Inn](http://www.stephanie-inn.com/welcome.html). And then in Portland for a couple nights. Also drove around a lot and saw a lot of central Oregon -- Bend, Redmond, Sisters. Some beautiful territory there.

All while Liz was paddling her way down the Deschutes river with her [Outward Bound](http://www.pcobs.org/) course. She had a great time, although she struggled thru food poisoning and a day when it was 107 in the shade. But another great outward bound experience.

BTW Oregon has sucky wireless coverage. Blackberry worked in Portland and in a very narrow band around. I was surprised there was no coverage on I-5. And digital cell phones have very limited coverage on the major highways. In central oregon and on the coast, only analog roaming was reliable.
