**Permalinks Redux**. Despite some misgivings I have added permalinks to my site. Convinced by email from [Olivier Travers](http://webvoice.blogspot.com/). I am very doubtful about my ability to maintain the permanency of these links over the lifetime of my blog, as I expect my blog to operate for the remainder of my natural life and I expect to change the underlying implementation many times. The blog community is young and the technology is young, I think we are all kidding ourselves about the durability of the chosen design point and syntax. Only time will tell.
