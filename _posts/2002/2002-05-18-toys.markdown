**Toys**. Need to try out [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/main.html), haven't looked at in years. Also recommended is [Photoshop Elements](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopel/main.html) for digital photo munging. And [moodlogic.net](http://www.moodlogic.net/) looks like a great way to use my CD collection.
