**Sight Gags**. [The Gag Works](http://www.gagworks.com/index.htm) looks like the best source...I need some of the "arrows thru head" for my Custer costume. Or maybe a nice [Monk Robe](http://www.garbtheworld.knownworldweb.com/monks.html) or [another](http://www.imperialweapons.com/costumes/8-234.html) if I go as the hunchback again.
