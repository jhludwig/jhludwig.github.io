**Neuros**. Love the FM output so that it can be wirelessly hooked up to existing car stereo, home tuner, etc -- [John Robb's Radio Weblog](http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/11/12.html#a2832). Now we just need a better wireless connection, one which doesn't suffer from the range compression and other artifacts of FM.
