**Hard Disks+Broadband vs DVDs.** [Joshua](http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/2002/12/18.html#a262) wonders why people bother with trying to burn DVDs. I had a similar experience recently. I had to get a copy of a video to someone. After capturing it from my camera, I went thru the trouble of trying to get it back on a DVD, worrying about +R/-R formats, hoping the DVD would work in their player, etc. And then had an aha moment and just jammed the video in 4-5 different encodings on my website. Worked great. Leave the DVD burning to someone who wants to screw around with DVD compat issues.
