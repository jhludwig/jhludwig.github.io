**Gaming PCs**.

I am getting ready to start spec'ing out and building my next PC. I am starting to collect inspiration -- the [alienware site](http://www.bestbuy.com/ComputersPeripherals/specials/AlienwareMain.asp) has some cool machines but I fear I want more.

[Tech Junkie](http://www.tech-junkie.com/) also seems like a great source of inspiration. Quit a few articles on overclocking the GeForce 4.
