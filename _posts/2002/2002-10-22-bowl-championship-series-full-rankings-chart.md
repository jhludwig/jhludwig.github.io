**BCS**. First rankings out -- [Bowl Championship Series - Full Rankings Chart](http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/2002-2003.html).

OK how can Ohio State be considered to have the weakest schedule of the top 6 teams, but have the most points for quality wins? Makes no sense at all.

I guess it doesn't really matter now...we just need to beat Penn State Saturday and trust that things will work out.
