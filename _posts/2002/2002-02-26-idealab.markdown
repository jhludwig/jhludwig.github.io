**Idealab**

We are an investor in [Idealab](http://www.idealab.com/), and boy have we learned hard lessons here. Our one really bad dotcom mistake. Bill Gross the founder is brilliant but things have not turned out well. [Business Week](http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2001/nf20011221_2747.htm) had an article on. And our lawsuit against the company is mentioned in [Fortune](http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=artcol.jhtml&doc_id=206543) and in [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0304/044a.html) (sorry you have to register at Forbes to read the article).

This was the quickest investment decision I ever made and the worst. The connection is obvious....
