**Outage**. Off the web most of yesterday, as was our office at [Ignition](http://www.ignitionpartners.com). Routing problem at [Conxion](http://www.conxion.net). Surprising how hard it was to find -- you would think that they could have discovered the problem in less than 8-10 hours.

Surprising how useless I am without the net for a day. No email. No shopping. No research. I just kept running "ping 206.204.4.6" all day long, trying to see my DNS server...
