**Population Stats**. I'm on the board of [Forest Ridge](http://www.forestridge.org) and I am trying to get a good handle on demographics and population forecasts for the next 10-20 years. Here is what I have found so far -- the [Economic Development Council of Seattle and King County](http://www.edc-sea.org/research_data/economic_demographics.cfm); and it's source data from the [Washington State Office of Financial Management](http://www.ofm.wa.gov/popagesex19702020/popagesex19702020toc.htm). Very interesting -- it suggests that the middle school population in the area is declining in size in the next 5-10 years.
