**Xbox Live experience**. Installed this on christmas day. Overall a fun product but some issues. Whacked is a fun social game that we've been playing a lot. Very easy to join up with others. The big problem is the communicator voice attachment. It seems like a great idea, and I think when you are playing with known friends it will be fun. But wow did I hear some salty language in the random games, comments that were just not appropriate. And you can imagine sick people taking advantage of a system that let's them talk anonymously to kids.
