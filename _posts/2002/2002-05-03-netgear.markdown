**Netgear**. As a break I installed the [Netgear](http://www.netgear.com/) FS 105 100mbit switch, upgrading one of my minihubs. Wow was this painless. The autodetection of uplink port and cable type made this soooooo simple. Love it.

These guys totally get the "First 30 Minutes" principle. If the first 30 minutes of a product are great, you will have an enthusiastic and committed customer. If the first 30 minutes are rocky, well that is trouble.
