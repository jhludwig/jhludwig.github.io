**Axworthy ghost status**. Making good progress on this. I have a small motor -- an appliance fan motor. May be too fast and too low torque but am going to try it. I've got my drive wheel -- an old lawnmower wheel to mount on the motor. I've got my carriage wheels -- wheelbarrow wheels. I've got my carriage line -- 100 lb test fishing line. Doing a lot of parts prep and assembly this week, I hope to have a limping system this weekend. See my halloween blog for links to [axworthy ghosts](http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html) if you don't know what i am talking about.
