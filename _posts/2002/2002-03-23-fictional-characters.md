**Fictional Characters**. From NPR, the [100 best of the last century](http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html). I'm embarrassed about how few of these titles I have read. Equally impressive is [paul maritz's book collection](http://www.imvumbu.com/books/Book%20Collection%2012-2001.htm) \-- i am embarrassed about my own massmarket reading habits.
