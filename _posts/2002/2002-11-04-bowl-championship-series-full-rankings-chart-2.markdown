**BCS Rankings Nov 4**. WHOO HOO! -- [Bowl Championship Series - Full Rankings Chart](http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/index.html). Ohio State is #2!!!!!!!!!

OK here is what needs to happen to guarantee we stay there:

- Ohio State has to win out.
- Va Tech needs to beat Miami. This would ice it.
- WSU needs to keep winning. They should but the UW game will be emotional.
- It wouldn't hurt if OSU's other opponents kept on winning -- Michigan, Texas Tech, Penn State, etc. Keep that strength of schedule gap vs Miami.
- Oklahoma needs to keep playing tough and hopefully leapfrog Miami in the USA Today/ESPN poll.
