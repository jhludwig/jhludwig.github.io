**Windows Update**. A friendly reminder -- if you are running a win98 or better system and aren't checking [windows update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com) periodically, you should be. the number of critical security fixes flowing thru win update is high and some of these are pretty important. you can ignore all the optional components but the critical security fixes seem like goodness.
