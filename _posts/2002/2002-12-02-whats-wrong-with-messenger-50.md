**What's Wrong with Messenger 5.0**. Besides all [these problems](http://actsofvolition.com/index.cfm?article=614#614) (some of which don't bother me), the biggest problem is the confusion between MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger, which are both now running on my system and fighting with each other. Blake, David, Chris -- help!
