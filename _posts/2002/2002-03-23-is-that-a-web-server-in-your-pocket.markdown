**Is that a web server in your pocket?** From my buddy Adrian Smith -- "Ahh, the pieces are coming together for my web-browsable doohickies - ? just saved me weeks of dev time ! [http://www.siteplayer.com/](http://www.siteplayer.com/) Pretty neat little webserver on a 1? sq board for $30. Doesn?t run ASP scripts but you can poke variables into the web page it creates. Now need to find an 802.11 version !"

I want to bundle one of these with a battery and an 802.11 card so that I can carry my blog on my person as I walk around. Why? I don't know, it just seems cool.

In the shorter term I guess I can just make my Pocket PC a [web server](http://www.newmad.se/software.asp)...the toshiba [e570](http://www.csd.toshiba.com/pda/pda_home.html) comes recommended as the best 802.11 pocketpc...
