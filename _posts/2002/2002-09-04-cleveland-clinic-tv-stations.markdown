**Cleveland Clinic TV Stations**. I'm flipping channels at the guest house here. A saudi network, abu dhabi, kuwait, indian, another arabic channel, a turkish channel? Very interesting spread, indicates a lot about the customer base. Why no european, no spanish language, no asian? Where do these people go for cardiac care?
