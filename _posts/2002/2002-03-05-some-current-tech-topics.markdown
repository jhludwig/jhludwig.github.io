**Some current tech topics**

My buddy Rich has a lot of great info up on his [weblog](http://www.tongfamily.com/weblog/) about a variety of topics. Recently he and I have been captivated with low cost storage systems. He's figured out the way to build a really low cost 120GB file server for your network, including full mirroring for disaster recovery purposes. Very cool, I will probably build one of these. With something like this on your home network, you don't need to worry about buying big hard disks on your PCs in the future.

Another thing coming to your home network is wireless networking. [This site](http://80211b.weblogger.com/) is a great source of news and tech tips.

We've also noticed in compusa and other computer stores recently that routers and wireless routers for the home are flying off the shelves. For instance look at the [top sellers](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/658666/ref=pc_hp_ln_ne/103-9804194-5298262) at Amazon in this category right now. Everyone who has a dsl or cable modem connection is wiring up their house to get all their PCs on that connection -- and wireless is often the way to go.

We're excited about this. With all this networking getting deployed, there is the opportunity to provide the solutions and apps on top of this infrastructure that consumers really want. For instance, why is it so hard for me to share pictures with the rest of you? Why don't new pictures that I take just show up on your home network for viewing?
