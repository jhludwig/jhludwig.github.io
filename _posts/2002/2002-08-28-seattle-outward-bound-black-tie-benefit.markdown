**Outward Bound event**. Liz and I think we'll go to the [Seattle Black Tie Benefit](http://www.pcobs.org/information/2col.asp?NavPageID=19855) for Outward Bound -- looks like a lot of fun, more fun than a normal auction event. Interesting to read the corporate sponsorship list -- [Endeavour Capital](http://www.endeavourcapital.com/) looks interesting, a very different kind of investment firm than is Ignition, but very similar values -- I suppose some of the principals there are Outward Bound alums.
