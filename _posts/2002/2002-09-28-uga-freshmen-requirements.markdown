**Kudos to UW Admissions site**. This [chart](http://www.washington.edu/students/uga/fr/reqs/odds.htm) is great, provides very clear direction to students about their likelihood of admission at the U. Last year's version was even more detailed but this is still great. Wish every university did this.
