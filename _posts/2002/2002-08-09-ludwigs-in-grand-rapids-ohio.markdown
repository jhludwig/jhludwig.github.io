**Ludwigs in Grand Rapids Ohio**. Hmm someone did a google search for "ludwigs grand rapids ohio" and hit my site accidentally. But hey I know something about this topic as my grandfather Cleo is from Grand Rapids and was involved in the acquisition of the [Isaac Ludwig mill](http://www.metroparkstoledo.com/canal.html) which is apparently now part of the Toledo Metroparks system. So if you are out there, drop me a note and we can chat.
