**Home NAS** I got my NAS installed last night. NAS == Network Attached Storage in case you weren't aware. I used the Promise [ConnectStor](http://www.promise.com/product/subsys_detail_eng.asp?pid=13&fid=4) naked NAS chassis, with 2 [Western Digital 120GB Drives](http://www.wdc.com/products/products.asp?DriveID=12). I used a Raid 1 configuration, the default. So for under $1000, I have 120GB of fully redundant storage. I don't need big whopping disk drives on my pcs anymore -- not that the cost per pc is a big deal, but i am tired of forgetting what file is where. And I am tired of moving files from PC to PC when I upgrade. And of course I never backup so this gives me some improved reliability.
