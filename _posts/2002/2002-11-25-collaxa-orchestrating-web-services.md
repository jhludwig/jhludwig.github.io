**Java and .Net both a disaster**. Edwin discusses this on the [Collaxa](http://www.collaxa.com/news.blog.html#85680551) site. I agree with the tenor of his thoughts -- people need to do smaller, more incremental development. I also think the platforms are just too complex -- we need a simpler platform for the next generation of apps, one that a developer can get their head around in a day with minimum expense.
