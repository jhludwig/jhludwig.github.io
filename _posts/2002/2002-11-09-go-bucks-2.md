**Go Bucks!!!.** Yee Ha. A close one but a win is a win, and with Oklahoma's loss, we should clearly be #1 in the BCS based on my initial calculations. Even without the bonus for beating WSU (who won again, so we get that bonus) it still seems to me that we will be #1. Only if the Miami victory over Tennessee causes major changes in the computer polls (due to the perceived toughness of Tennessee) will OSU lose its #1 position.
