**Xbox Live and 802.11a**. I'm trying to figure out if this combo will work well. My xbox is in one of the few rooms in my house without a cat5 tap and so I want to use 802.11a to bridge the xbox onto the lan. I can find little info about this config on the net. Officially, Microsoft says it [won't support wireless connections](http://www.xbox.com/support/con-wireless.htm). But on the [xbox forums](http://forums.xbox.com), many people have said they made it work. Many of them recommend the [Linksys WET11](http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=432&grid=22) bridge. I'll probably try that.
