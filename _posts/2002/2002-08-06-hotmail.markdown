**Hotmail**. Hotmail is declining in utility for me. The hotmail team has obviously started to break the HTTP-DAV interfaces so that I can no longer check email from Outlook or Outlook Express. I guess if I pay for extra storage or MSN8 that I will get the feature back, but given the silent unannounced breakage I am worried that it won't be turned on very cleanly and supported well. And I have 4 hotmail accounts that I regularly check and I don't want to pay for all of them separately.

I am going to start looking at other web-based email solutions. I guess I could host my own mail server but I am willing to pay a small amount to outsource it, I am not excited about taking on yet another IT task and management burden.
