**X10 Halloween**. Deep in the throes of getting all my x10 setup debugged for halloween. Man x10 just sucks. The gear is fragile, all kinds of mysterious communication problems, the software sucks. I hate it. But it is cheap and widely available.

I am close to dumping the gui software I use and just write some scripts. I see that there is Perl support available [here](http://members.aol.com/Bbirthisel/x10.d/). And a web interface on top of perl support at [X10 Web Control](http://www.homeautomationzone.com/x10-web.shtml).

Next year tho I may just pick up a few more dmx dimmers and do away with x10 altogether. I don't see anything on the web abour perl/python interfaces to dmx tho.

Maybe next year I should be an early adopter of uPNP or some such crazy scheme.
