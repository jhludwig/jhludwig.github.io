**GB Ethernet**. After a night of trying to move captured video files around, I am ready to sign up for gigabit ethernet. At least one site recommends the [dlink product line](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,661881,00.asp) -- i hope they have a switch with more than 4 ports. Surprising little discussion of gigabit ethernet on the enthusiast sites based on my quick scan -- for instance i found nothing on tom's hardware. are people really not playing around with this in the home?
