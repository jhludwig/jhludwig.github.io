**My site Architecture**. Starting to think about the next iteration of my site architecture. The current site is just blogger driven+some minor template mods. There are a lot of things I want to do tho that I am not getting from this architecture -- a good search interface, a good URL command line interface, categories, private password-protected posts, server-side aggregation of various feeds, complete separation of content from template. [Bloxsom](http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/) is an interesting alternative, and of course I have already paid for Radio.
