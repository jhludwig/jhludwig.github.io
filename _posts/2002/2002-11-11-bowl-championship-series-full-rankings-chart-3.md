**BCS 11/11**. My [projections](http://www.theludwigs.com/CollegeFootball/BCS%20Components.htm) were darn close to the actuals -- [Bowl Championship Series - Full Rankings Chart](http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/index.html). I gave Miami more credit for improving schedule strength than they actually got. I had all the computer components right. We'll see how I do next Saturday.
