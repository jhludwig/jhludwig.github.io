**FLAC v1.0.4**. From [Lockergnome](http://www.lockergnome.com):

_I don't claim to be an audiophile, but I still love good music. I'm content with the quality and sound of an MP3 file, but I do have some friends who don't like MP3s because of the loss of audio quality in the compressed format. That's great, but who wants a bunch of huge WAV audio files taking up all your hard drive space? [FLAC]( http://flac.sourceforge.net/) stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, and basically that means that you can use FLAC to compress your WAV files without losing audio quality in the compression process. FLAC won't let you make a file nearly as small as an MP3, but it was able to turn one of my 42MB WAV files into a much smaller 30MB FLAC file. That may not seem like a lot, but imagine doing that to an entire music directory! FLAC also comes with a plug-in that allows you to listen to FLAC files in Winamp. FLAC does run from a command prompt, but on the same Web site you can download a Windows GUI front end that makes the whole conversion process much easier. For you programmers out there, FLAC is open source, so that means that you have access to all the source code and can incorporate this codec into your own applications. I guess my best friend may not have to buy a second hard drive now!_
