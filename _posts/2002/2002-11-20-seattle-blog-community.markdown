**Seattle Blog Community**. Lots of interesting blogs up here -- [eatonweb portal :: the original weblog directory](http://portal.eatonweb.com/state/Washington). I see there is an attempt to have a [meet tonight](http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00000671.html). Can't do this one because of L's birthday but will try to get to the next one. Or organize one.
