**Forest Ridge Board meeting**. We had a great board retreat last week. Some really great people on the board -- Mike Russell at [Accenture](http://www.accenture.com) and Walt Orlowski (formerly of MD and [Boeing](http://www.boeing.com)) are great new additions to the board. I really enjoyed their articulation of the challenging market we face -- every school is getting better, we have to improve just to keep our current enrollment -- and of the need to have a strong quantative assessment of the market as the baseline for our planning. Really good vibe.
