**UK Universities**. One of the family wants to look at UK universities and colleges. Man am I dumb about these. My coworker Adrian Smith turned me onto [UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service)](http://www.ucas.com/), which seems to be the clearinghouse for applying to schools. There are some good online rankings sites as well -- [EducationGuardian.co.uk | University guide](http://education.guardian.co.uk/universityguide) for instance, and pointers to several at [UK University Ratings](http://www.britishcouncil-usa.org/education/ratings.shtml). Fascinating to dig into this -- a whole different language of requirements, test scores, courses of study, etc.
