**Geek Fishing.** Tong's new tech blog, focused on wireless toys and ideas -- [Geek Fishing](http://www.geekfishing.net/). OK I am now officially involved with blogs using Radio, Cafelog, and Blogger. Now I want a meta-blogging client that will let me edit and create content, and post it to any and all of my blogs.
