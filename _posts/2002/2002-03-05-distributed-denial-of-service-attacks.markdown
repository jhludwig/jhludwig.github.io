**Distributed Denial of Service Attacks**

A [great article](http://grc.com/dos/drdos.htm) on another recent attack. A sidebar -- if you all have recent Windows machines (Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP), you should all be running [windows update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com) periodically to ensure that you have all the latest security fixes. The fixes marked "critical" are the ones you want at a minimum.
