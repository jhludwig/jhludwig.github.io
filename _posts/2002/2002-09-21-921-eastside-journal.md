**9/21 Eastside Journal**. "Boeing issues more layoff notices". Picked up from the Oregonian -- ["Dotcom collapse, terror attacks left puget sound economy in ruins"](http://www.oregonlive.com/business/oregonian/index.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/business/1032350150249720.xml). Dow down 326 yesterday.

Meanwhile in another article, Harvey Pitt is quoted as saying it is "more than safe" to invest.

I guess I don't get the boosterism of investing. There is no real good news to make me think equities are going to take off. The economy in this area at least has not bottomed out. There is no evidence for a recovery.
