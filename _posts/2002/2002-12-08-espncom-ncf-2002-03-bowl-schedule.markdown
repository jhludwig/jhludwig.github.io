**Bowl Schedule**. [ESPN.com: NCF - 2002-03 Bowl schedule](http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2002-03_bowls.html) -- the Rose, Orange, and Fiesta all seem pretty interesting. Sugar Bowl is too regional to really have much buzz. I am also interested in the Outback Bowl -- Michigan vs Florida, two great programs. Virginia vs WVU in the Continental Tire Bowl seems like a fun matchup. The Seattle Bowl sounds like a snoozer -- just no heat between Oregon and Wake Forest.
