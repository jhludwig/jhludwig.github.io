**Living in the City.** Friday night -- take John to friend's house in Woodinville. Out to dinner with C in Bellevue. Up to Liz's school for Volleyball match. Saturday morning -- drop off Liz in U district at UW. Stop in Redmond for coffee and errands at Home Depot. Pick up John in Woodinville and take him back home to Bellevue. Back across the lake to UW to get Liz in the midst of the Huskies game traffic. Back to Bellevue, drop off Liz. The rest of us to downtown Seattle for some errands. Stop in Mercer Island on way there to get gas, on way back to pick up dinner.

Someday I will be glad to live in a smaller town again...
