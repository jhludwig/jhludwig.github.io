**Your Tax Dollars at Work**. The Ohio State Legislature, after 200 years of statehood, is finally rectifying an [obvious oversight](http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=124_SB_264) -- choosing a state amphibian. Thank goodness. It can join now the state beverage -- tomato juice -- and the state fossil -- trilobite -- and the many other fine symbols of Ohio.

Here in Washington we are [waaaay behind](http://www.leg.wa.gov/legis/symbols/symbols.htm) -- we have a state insect, fish, fossil, tree, but no amphibian. Are slugs amphibians? They'd get my vote.
