**Halloween Lighting**. Started to deploy lighting tonight. Step one -- replace all the bulbs in exterior carriage lights with flicker bulbs. These bulbs can be hard to find at retail, I get mine at [Kelsun Distributors](http://www.seattleindex.com/showcat3.asp?comp=52016) in Bellevue. Next is to place all the lightning lights. I have a variety of lights that trigger off my thunder soundtrack -- a mix of small strobes, big strobes, 120v incandescent floods, and this year i added in some 12V floods as people on the MoM group say they respond more quickly (basically, lower voltage lights have faster response times). All together I have about 20-30 lights that go off with the thunder spread around the yard. All I did tonight was place the lights. This weekend I have to distribute my DMX control cable and actually start triggering them.
