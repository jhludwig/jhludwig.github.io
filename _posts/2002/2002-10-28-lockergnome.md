**Lockergnome**. Love this [newsletter](http://www.lockergnome.com). More great stuff over the weekend. [Phone Scoop](http://www.phonescoop.com/) for user reviews of cell phones. [Serial ATA Working Group](http://www.serialata.org/) website for info on serial ATA -- I am dying to get this in my PCs, existing cabling is just too intimidating. Amaze your friends with [A List of the Keyboard Shortcuts That Are Available in Windows XP](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q301583). See how deleted your files really are with [Deleted File Analysis Utility](http://www.mywebattack.com/gnomeapp.php?id=105454). Quick kb access to directories in open/save dialogs with [Pathbuddy](http://www.mywebattack.com/gnomeapp.php?id=105465).

And for some reason nothing appeals to my sensibilities like [Scott's Box Shot Maker](http://www.boxshotmaker.com/).
