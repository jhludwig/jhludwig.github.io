**Fireball**. Brad Chase is looking at the [Escient Fireball](http://www.escientconvergence.com/fireball.htm) as a potential media hub. certainly claims to do it all. expensive -- i wonder if it is worth it. It all depends on the integration -- I can do all this much more cheaply with a PC but I have to use 25 different pieces of software. If the fireball really makes it easy to do all the things it claims, the integration would be worth something.
