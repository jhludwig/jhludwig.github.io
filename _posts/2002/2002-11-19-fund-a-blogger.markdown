**Fund a Blogger?** [Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) asked me in a [comments](http://radiocomments.userland.com/comments?u=1011&p=1771&link=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0001011%2F2002%2F11%2F14.html%23a1771) thread if we would ever fund a blogger. And the answer is "of course". Both [Tong](http://www.tongfamily.com) and I are very high on blogs -- the amount of energy and innovation around blogs is exciting! There are certainly going to be good businesses here somewhere. I don't think we know what a good business in the blog space is yet, but we are certainly observing with interest and are happy to hear ideas.
