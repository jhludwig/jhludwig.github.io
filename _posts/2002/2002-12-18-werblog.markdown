**Blog Backup**. Why I continue to stick with blogger -- [WERBLOG -- Back from the Dead](http://werbach.com/blog/2002/12/18.html). With blogger I get a little disaster recovery capability -- if my server explodes tomorrow, the content is up in blogger servers, and if blogger goes toes up tomorrow, the content is on my server. If i move to MT or Radio, then I have to take on a backup burden too, and experience has shown that I suck at backup (like many people).
