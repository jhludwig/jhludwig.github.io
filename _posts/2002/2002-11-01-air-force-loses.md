**Air Force Loses**. Check out what happened last night -- [ESPN.com - NCF - Recap - Colorado State at Air Force - 10/31/2002](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=223042005). Why do I care? Because it further weakens Notre Dame's strength of schedule rating (Air Force was one of their vaunted opponents) and thus weakens their BCS rating. Go Bucks!
