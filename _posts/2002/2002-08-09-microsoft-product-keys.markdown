**Microsoft Product Keys**. I get a consistent number of Google referrals of people looking for Microsoft Product Keys. The traffic seems to be growing. Hey folks I don't post any keys here. Actually I wonder if the traffic isn't from Microsoft or its agents looking for evidence of piracy.

UPDATE (7/3/07). Hey folks. THERE ARE NO PRODUCT KEYS HERE AND I AM NOT GOING TO HELP YOU FIND ONE. If you have a legitimate need for a key, call Microsoft.

This blog is predominately about [Halloween](http://www.theludwigs.com/halloween/), [The Buckeyes](http://www.fanblogs.com/big10/ohio_state/), [books I've read](http://www.theludwigs.com/Books/), and a variety of tech and business topics as they interest me. It is not about product keys.
