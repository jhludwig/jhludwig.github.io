**Drive imaging**. I've suffered thru several recent system failures and have had to reinstall Windows+Apps which has been no fun. Time to start imaging my hard drives. Norton ghost is the obvious choice and i am also trialing [PowerQuest: Drive Image 2002](http://www.powerquest.com/driveimage/didetails.cfm). So far I don't love either one of them. I want to back up to my NAS and they are more geared to CD backup.
