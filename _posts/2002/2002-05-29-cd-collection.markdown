**CD Collection**. Finally finished ripping my entire cd collection (about 1000 discs) to my server. 96k, wma encoding, and I convert to mp3 for appliances as necessary.

Great to be done. Has been a background task for the last month. You can see what I am currently listening to on the left side of the page in the playlist section. I've been using windows media player for all my ripping (because it is less buggy than a lot of the tools i have tried and has less ad-ware than products from real) but the web page playlist feature motivated me to switch to [winamp](http://www.winamp.com) for playback.

I'd love to just get rid of all the cds now but I will have to rip these all again in 5 years or so when my hard disks are big enough to handle lossless uncompressed storage. So I'll keep them around for a while.
