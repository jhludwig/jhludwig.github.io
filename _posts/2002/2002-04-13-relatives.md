**Relatives**. A fun game to play on the net is to see what you can find out about your relatives. Extra points for obscurity. Not an exhaustive list below but some fun things I found out about my relatives:

Grandfather Cleo is a great supporter of the [4-H organization:](http://www.ohio4h.org/4hfoundation/histsupp.htm) "4-H gave me an opportunity for accomplishment, boosted my ego and brought me out of my shell of shyness and unworthiness." -- Cleo Ludwig, Founder, L & K Restaurants.

Sister Laura is easy to find -- tons of mentions due to her job at the [Ohio Department of Public Safety](http://www.state.oh.us/odps/division/ems/ems_local/default.htm). Ditto Cousin [Carolyn](http://www.bcschools.net/Administration.html).

Cousin John had a stint with the [Reds](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/all_time_stats/players/c/5382/)! Cool.

Cousin Susan's efforts are apparently appreciated by the [Franklin Country Democrats](http://www.fcdp.org/office.html). While her husband Erick is a member in good standing of the [Buckeye Beemers](http://home.columbus.rr.com/buckeyebeemers/reports/0002.member.html).

Brother-in-law Garry Curren is on the [all-time all-OAC team](http://www.heidelberg.edu/athletics/football/alltimeoac.html)! And is a heck of a [dog trainer](http://www.michiganvizsla.org/w98idx.htm). Speaking of dogs, [Aunt Carrie](http://www.marioncomputer.com/hutchman/) is a huge dog lover too.

Check out the high school/middle school photo of Dad -- [Pictures](http://www.geocities.com/schrade9/), near the bottom of the page, open the one named Paul Ludwig (if you can't find it there, try [here](http://www.theludwigs.com/Images/young%20paul.bmp)). And the [high school pics](http://www.pixi.com/~jharbin/classmates_58.html) of Rosemary and Garry!

No picture for Mom, but she and dad are appreciated by the [United Way](http://www.unitedwaymarion.org/bronze.htm).

Cousin Rob is well known in [Norwalk](http://www.norwalkoh.com/industries.html) -- home of the [Hen House](http://www.henhouseinc.com/).
