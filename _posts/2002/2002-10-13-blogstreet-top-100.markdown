**RSS Feeds**. [Dave](http://www.scripting.com/) recommends [BlogStreet: Top 100](http://www.blogstreet.com/top100.html) as a good source for RSS feeds. Also points to [DMOZ](http://dmoz.org/Reference/Libraries/Library_and_Information_Science/Technical_Services/Cataloguing/Metadata/RDF/Applications/RSS/News_Readers/) as a source for readers.
