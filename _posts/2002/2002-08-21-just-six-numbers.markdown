**Just Six Numbers**. I like [this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0465036732/qid=1029962788/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-5849507-2126540?s=books&n=507846) a lot -- fairly straightforward read about cosmology. I particularly like, in the discussion of dark matter, his analogy of the sea -- dark matter as the bulk of the undersurface water that we never see, "bright" matter as the small layer of frothy stuff on top we can see. A very humbling view of our position in the universe.

And the Woody Allen quote is great -- "Eternity is very long, especially towards the end."
