**SSL Not So Secure After All**. From [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26620.html), -- Microsoft's Internet Explorer and KDE's Konqueror are both guilty of not following proper procedures when using sites that employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections. Any site that has a valid VeriSign SSL site certificate can pretend to be an entirely different site, even going as far as impersonating another site and intercepting supposed- secure information.
