**Hunger at Thanksgiving**. I heard from friends back in [Marion](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion,_Ohio) that 1000 free meals were served yesterday from just one church for the holiday. Multiply this by the number of active churches, organizations, shelters, etc, and that is a pretty phenomenal number of meals for a town with a population of 35,000, in a county with a population of 66,000.

It is saddening that so many people need help -- but I am glad there are so many people back in Marion who are helping out.

When I stopped at [QFC](http://www.qfconline.com/) this am, i bought one of their pre-packaged bags of groceries for the food bank. Something I intend to do every trip to the market from now on.
