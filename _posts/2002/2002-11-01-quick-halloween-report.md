**Quick Halloween Report**. Another great evening. At least 400 kids came by. We gave away a car trunkful of candy. Big successes: my tombstones, the floating graveyard lantern, the creepy shipping crate. Failures: my axworthy ghost quit running after a short time. My "Ben" rat crate fizzled totally -- soundtrack died, door rattling motor died. My DMX remote failed so I couldn't manually turn on the doghouse fogger, tho the automated system did just fine. I know I should relax but I am already starting to think about next year -- replacement of all x10 with DMX, a better remote control option (maybe using a pda and 802.11), some pneumatic effects.
