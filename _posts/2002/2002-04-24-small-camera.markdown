**Small Camera**. Here's a [cool small camera](http://www.dynamism.com/cubik/index.shtml).

Makes me wonder about the limit to size of a camera. As moore's law drives down the size of necessary circuitry, I guess the limits to size are a) batteries, b) lens structure, and c) control surfaces. I would have in the past said storage media was a driver of size but no more, not with solid state media. Lens structure is a feature decision -- how much optical zoom, size do you want. I bet batteries can get very small as designers go to low power circuits. These cameras are going to get very very small....
