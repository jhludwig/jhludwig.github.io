OK I don't really find X10 to be that appropriate for haunt automation. Too much latency in the gear, and too unreliable a protocol. The latency is the big problem. That said, there is a lot of product available and it is relatively inexpensive. You can find x10 and also higher end home automation here -- [ASIhome](http://store.yahoo.com/asihome/index.html). Also All things x10 here -- [SMARTHOME.COM](http://www.smarthome.com/index.html)
