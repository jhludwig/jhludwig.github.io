**Christmas Wish List**. Here's my geek wishlist as of 10-31. The [Xantech MRC88](http://www.xantech.com/mrc88/index.htm) multizone audio controller, so i can centralize and control all my Halloween audio. Or maybe the [AVM20](http://www.anthemav.com/NewSitev2.0/AnthemProduct/AVM20/Specs/AVM20Specs.html) for the same purpose. The [Video xb](http://www.videoxb.com/) -- one simple box to add on to my PCs to solve all my video capture, storage, and authoring issues. Something from [Azden](http://www.azdencorp.com/home.html) for wireless distribution of all my Halloween audio. The [Cambridge SoundWorks Radio CD](http://www.hifi.com/store/category.cgi?category=search&item=c188cdxx&type=store) to replace my noisy cheap Timex alarm/cd player. The [Samsung 24" LCD Monitor](http://www.samsungusa.com/cgi-bin/nabc/product/b2c_product_detail.jsp?eUser=&prod_id=240T-Silver) for my desk. The [RCA Scenium 35-Hour Digital Media Recorder (DRS7000N)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000078OMG/qid=1036106026/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-1880996-6886562?v=glance&n=507846) to replace my existing DVD player and add another HD recorder in addition to my Tivo box. Some nifty [Verbatim Vinyl CDs](http://www.verbatim.com/products/products.cfm?pro_id=393). And the [Nike psa\[play - Portable Sport Audio by Philips](http://www.nike-philips.com/product_details.jsp?product=psa128max&lang=en) for treadmill time. And a late addition, the [Casio exilim](http://exilim.casio.com/camera.cfm) camera/mp3 player.

For the garage I need the [Wall-Mount Desk](http://www.duluthtrading.com/a/shop/dproduct.asp?UID=2002110200105091&GEN0=&GEN1=&T1=WD696&c=&s=3DTC2) from Duluth Trading.

Finally for the music hour, the [Yamaha SLG100N](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/srs7/sid=021101221354206204189011626143/search/g=home?q=slg100n) would be a nice practice guitar tho it is dorky looking. And the [Chordmaster](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/srs7/sid=021101221354206204189011626143/search/g=home?q=chordmaster) is way cool for finding chords.
