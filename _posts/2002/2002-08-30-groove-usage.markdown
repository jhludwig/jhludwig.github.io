**Groove Usage**. [Ray](http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/08/30.html#a53) notes that 25% of Groove users use it to sync their own files across multiple locations. The home/work sync problem is a huge one that, with broadband homes, ought to be solveable. Groove is a way but very heavyweight for the intended purpose. There has to be a solution that is much lighter that plugs into Windows and native Windows apps in a cleaner way. I've tried setting up my own VPN server at home but that is not worth the hassle. The WinXP remote desktop stuff is so unintuitive, it is not a good solution. I just want to be able to access any of my work or home files from any location without installing whole new app (like Groove) and without paying some service fee to store the files up in the cloud -- I already have tons of storage, thank you.
