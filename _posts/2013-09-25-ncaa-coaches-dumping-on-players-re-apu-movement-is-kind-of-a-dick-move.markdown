[Fitzgerald "disappointed"](http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/dennis-dodd/23826786/northwesterns-fitzgerald-disappointed-in-quarterbacks-decision-to-participate-in-apu) -- OK when you read the details, Fitzgerald actually is pretty reasonable, but still his word choice "disappointment" is what carries the day. And he should know that. A guy in position of power, making millions of dollars, expressing any disapproval of a young player who is under-compensated and has few rights -- that is a dick move. Saying it is a team issue and should have been handled within the team, and then talking to the press about it and expressing disappointment -- how exactly is that a team move on the coach's part?

Hopefully some coach will get on the right side of this issue.
