- [Age of Fracture](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Fracture-Daniel-T-Rodgers-ebook/dp/B004Z17I8M) by Daniel Rodgers. I really really wanted to like this book, it is well-regarded and seems to have an interesting thesis about what has happened in the last 50 years in our country. But overly wordy and repetitive, I just couldn't stay with.
- [Exit, Voice and Loyalty](https://www.amazon.com/Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Responses-Organizations/dp/0674276604) by Albert Hirschman. What a difference from the work above. Tight, focused arguments with detailed supporting notes, with clear economic thinking. Really enjoyed this, a lot of insight into company behavior and political party behavior. Very nice.
- [Medusa Uploaded](https://www.amazon.com/Medusa-Uploaded-Novel-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B0756K6X32) by Emily Devenport. Starts out super strong, a laborer on a generation ship stumbles into layers and waves of conspiracy. But flags in the last third.
