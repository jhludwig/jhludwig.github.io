Every year we play a couple board games over the holiday season. This year's winner was [Dead of Winter.](https://www.amazon.com/Plaid-Hat-Games-PH1000-Winter/dp/B00HFKITJC) The combination of collaborative play with individual secret objectives is great -- encourages a lot of dialog but you never quite know if you are hearing the truth. And the surprise changes to objectives or surprise events that happen every turn keeps everyone hoping. Not a short game to play but a lot of fun. We played with 5 people and it was perfect.
