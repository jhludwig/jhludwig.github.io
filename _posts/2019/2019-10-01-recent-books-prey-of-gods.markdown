- [The Prey of Gods](https://www.amazon.com/Prey-Gods-Nicky-Drayden-ebook/dp/B01LY7NUYQ/) by Nicky Drayden. Started out great with some novel characters and South African setting, kind of sputtered out.
- [The Long Ships](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Ships-Review-Books-Classics-ebook/dp/B003WUYOP2) by Frans G. Bengtsson.  OK how did I miss this for so long??  What a delightful escapade set during Viking times.  I am stunned I never found this when I was younger.  Thoroughly entertaining.
