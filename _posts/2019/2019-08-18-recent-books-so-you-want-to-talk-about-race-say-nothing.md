- [So You Want To Talk About Race](https://www.amazon.com/You-Want-Talk-About-Race/dp/1580058825) by Ijeoma Oluo. Very helpful coverage of a very tough topic.  Horrific recent news stories about personal attacks on the author.
- [Say Nothing](https://www.amazon.com/Say-Nothing-Murder-Northern-Ireland/dp/0385521316/) by Patrick Radden Keefe.  A deep slice of history during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  One hopes that the divisions being fostered in our own country never become as deep as those in Northern Ireland.
