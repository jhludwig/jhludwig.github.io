- [Our Towns](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Towns-000-Mile-Journey-America/dp/1101871849) by James and Deborah Fallows. An uplifting walk thru towns and cities across America, each of which is finding its way and wrestling successfully with renewal, growth, education, immigration. There is a lot of great stuff happening everywhere — we shouldn’t let the national miasma blind us. One observation they make — almost every town on an upward track has a micro brewery.
- [Those Who Knew](https://www.amazon.com/Those-Who-Knew-Idra-Novey/dp/0525560432) by Idra Novey. Not my usual style but a satisfying tale of a corrupt politician whose life ultimately unravels, and lifting of that weight off the people around him.
- [Senlin Ascends](https://www.amazon.com/Senlin-Ascends-Books-Babel-Book-ebook/dp/B074M62D7Y) by Josiah Bancroft. First in a series about a world dominated by a steampunk-ish Tower of Babel. Part allegory, part swashbuckler. A great deal of fun.
