I bought a Lytro back in the day. It spent a week in my bag before it hit the technology graveyard in the corner of my office.

My [narrative clip](http://getnarrative.com/) lasted maybe a week. Everyone around me was freaked out. And mostly I just ended up with a lot of pictures of the edge of my desk.

I just got my [Pixy](http://www.charmedlabs.com/pixystart). Maybe I am doing it wrong but this thing doesn't seem to detect squat. Maybe it works great in some super controlled setting but not worth my time.

Of course I had to order a [Centr](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1307511016/centr-interactive-panoramic-video-in-the-palm-of-y).

I am eternally optimistic. One of these things is going to be useful.
