- "The Cloud Atlas":amazon by Liam Callanan. A little slow but builds nicely. A tragic tale set on the margins of WW II. Well researched. Ultimately I'm not totally sure I understand the main character's behaviour tho, I can't imagine most people enduring the abuse in this way.
- "The Innocent":amazon by Harlan Coben. Ok but not his best work. A little too mary-higgins-clark-"I am your twin sister separated at birth"-ish for me.
