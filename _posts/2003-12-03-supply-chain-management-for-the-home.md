[Wi-Fi Networking News: Supply Chain Management for the Home?](http://wifinetnews.com/archives/002619.html "Wi-Fi Networking News: Supply Chain Management for the Home?") -- hmm, interesting. Obviously homes don't need enterprise-quality SCM but I think we would all agree -- finding and managing vendors and service providers for the home is a PITA. Maybe I am just the worst records manager in the world, but when my garage door opener died recently, it was a major effort to find the piece of paper with the installer's name from 5 years ago. And when you sell a home, all that info generally is lost.  
  
It would be cool if, at the neighborhood level, we could all easily share referrals on service providers, see comments, etc.
