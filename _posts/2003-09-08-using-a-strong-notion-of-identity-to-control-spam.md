This seems inevitable to me -- [Techno-News Blog](http://people.uis.edu/rschr1/archive/2003_09_07_archive.html#106301832858501506 "Techno-News Blog") -- we need a stronger system of identity on the net if we really want to stop spam. I would switch to a mailsystem today that had a stronger notion and in fact I am evaluating all kinds of solutions currently.  
  
Update: Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha. So I decided to start acting on my words and I thought I'd get a certificate so I could start signing all my email sent from Outlook. I clicked on the link in Outlook to get a certificate and I was take to [this page](http://office.microsoft.com/marketplace/PortalProviderPreview.aspx?AssetID=EY010504891033&CTT=6&Origin=EC010272491033&&helplcid=1033) -- my guess is that NO ONE tries to get certificates for Outlook based on this.
