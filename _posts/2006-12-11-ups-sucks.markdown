Boy [UPS](http://www.ups.com) let us down this week. We had perishable food shipped Friday in their approved containers to us for Saturday delivery. Saturday came and went, no packages. The tracking site indicates the packages were left behind overnight for some reason. I called and UPS's responses:

\* "did you call us saturday during the day and raise an issue? Because we would have prioritized them." What am I supposed to bird-dog all the packages I send? I didn't realize this. \* "oh you used a UPS store? you shouldn't do that, they are unreliable, you should go straight to UPS facilities." So maybe you don't want to lend your brand to all those stores because as far as I am concerned, UPS now sucks.

I am waiting for email from UPS explaining all this.
