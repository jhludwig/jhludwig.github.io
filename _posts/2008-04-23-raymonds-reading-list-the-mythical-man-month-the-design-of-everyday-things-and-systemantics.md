Great recos from Raymond -- [The Old New Thing : Raymond's reading list: The Mythical Man-Month, The Design of Everyday Things, and Systemantics](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/16/8398400.aspx) -- I've never read the last but need to get it. The Mythical Man Month is awesome and if Systemantics is as good, then well worth reading.
