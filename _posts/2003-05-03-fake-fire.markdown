Halloween tip of the day -- From the MoM yahoo group -- Fire is usually created visually with cantalope colored orange (pale amber)and with bright pale yellow in random patterns. My suggestion would be to place the light fixture in a coffee can through the bottow with venting on the sides as too not get too warm and then gel the tops with colored gel. The plastic lid, after cutting out all of the center and leaving a half an inch of the lids outer egde and the grip , is great for a holding on the plastic sheet of gel. Gel is a plastic sheet, sold in 20" x 24" sheets for $4.99 It changes the color of your regular white light source to the color of the gel. A quick and easy way to set an entire mood in a theatrical space for a fraction of the cost of a couple of colored bulds.
