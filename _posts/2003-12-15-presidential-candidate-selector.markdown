[ProfessorBainbridge.com: My Results: SelectSmart.com 2004 Presidential Candidate Selector](http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2003/12/my_results_sele.html "ProfessorBainbridge.com: My Results: SelectSmart.com 2004 Presidential Candidate Selector") -- interesting. I tried it and Kerry also came up very high for me. I have no idea what algorithm the site is really using, and it seems to focus on general platform statements versus demonstrated behaviour, but a useful tool nonetheless.
