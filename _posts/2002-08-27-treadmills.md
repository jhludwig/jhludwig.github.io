**Treadmills**. Looking for a good one for home use. Need to get that daily exercise going!

Some models that get good press -- [Precor M9.55](http://www.precor.com/hpr_tre_955.php), the [True Fitness](http://www.truefitness.com/treadmills/residential/res_intro2.html) lineup, the [Landice Roadrunner](http://www.landice.com/RoadRunner/rr-details.html) with built in 6CD player, the [Smooth](http://www.smoothfitness.com/products/models_treadmills.htm) lineup, the rest of the [Landice](http://www.landice.com/Pages/modelspage.html) lineup.

Good review sites include [Advanced Fitness Treadmill Reviews](http://www.advancedfitness.com/info/monster.htm), [TreadmillDoctor](http://www.treadmilldoctor.com/), and the [About.com Treadmill](http://walking.about.com/library/gg/aatptreadmillquality.htm) site.
