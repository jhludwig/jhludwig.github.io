Wow these just keep getting better -- [PhotographyBLOG -:- Home](http://www.photographyblog.com/weblog.php?id=P713 "PhotographyBLOG -:- Home") 4 megapixel AND a 3x optical zoom in a small form factor. I have loved my casio ex-m2, but the picture quality has been so-so. The ex-z3 looks like a great holiday gift i can ask for.
