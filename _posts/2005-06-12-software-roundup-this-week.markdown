\* [Microsoft's Acrylic](http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/). Installed. I'm not a graphics wonk but certainly seems easier to use than GIMP. \* [Sysinternals process explorer](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.html). Another great tool for finding out what is going on in your PC. I wish it explained rundll hosted DLLs a little more clearly. \* [Dumeter](http://www.dumeter.com/). Nice for seeing what traffic is really hitting the net from your system. Wish this tied back to something like the process explorer so I could see by process. Hey Pure Networks folks... \* Phil is [hosting an infocom interpreter for blackberries on his site](http://www.thebogles.com/blog/2005/06/play-infocom-classics-on-your.html). Fun memories. \* [Biopassword](http://www.biopassword.com/bp2/products/b%2Didentified/overview.asp). Thought about trying but passed. But I like the idea. \* Gadgetopia recommends [BitLord](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2005/05/30/BitLord.html) for torrent downloading, I haven't tried. \* A [pointer to FireANT](http://rasterweb.net/raster/2005/06/09/fireant/ ). I may start videoing some of my hikes and may want to play around with this. \* Something here about [Ajax debugging](http://javascript.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000233045841/), seems interesting. \* Matt Croydon thinks [A9.com](http://www.a9.com) [rocks](http://www.postneo.com/2005/06/10/a9-search-beta-rocks ). I haven't looked at for a while, I did today, it does seem to be getting cooler. \* Several bloggers pointed towards [the real-time update log of Wikipedia](http://www.weblogg-ed.com/2005/06/09#a3648), so much so that the service went down. Too bad, this would be fascinating to watch. I'm embarrassed to admit that I haven't contributed anything to Wikipedia yet.
