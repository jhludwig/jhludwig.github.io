- [High-Rise](http://www.amazon.com/High-Rise-Novel-J-G-Ballard/dp/0871404028) by J. G. Ballard. [![eb](images/eb.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2016/05/recent-books-high-rise-travelers-song-machine-the-whites-electric-barracuda/eb/)The community in a modern high-rise starts to fall apart in "Lord of the Flies" fashion...actually "Lord of the Flies" seems pretty tame after this.
- [The Travelers](http://www.amazon.com/Travelers-Novel-Chris-Pavone/dp/0385348487) by Chris Pavone. A travel writer is coopted and stumbles into a job as a spy, and slowly learns that nothing is as it seems in his life. Fun.
- [The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory](http://www.amazon.com/Song-Machine-Inside-Hit-Factory/dp/0393241920) by John Seabrook. No surprise here, pop music is largely a manufactured product.
- [The Whites](http://www.amazon.com/Whites-Novel-Richard-Price/dp/0312621302) by Richard Price. Couldn't finish. Supposedly a gritty police drama but kind of dull.
- [Electric Barracuda](http://www.amazon.com/Electric-Barracuda-Novel-Serge-Storms/dp/0061876917) by Tim Dorsey. I generally don't like farce, but there is something endearing about this character -- a wise-cracking serial killer with a heart of gold.
