[Seattle Weekly: Food: Dining Guide: Dining Showcase 2003 by Roger Downey](http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0317/food-dgintro.php "Seattle Weekly: Food: Dining Guide: Dining Showcase 2003 by Roger Downey") -- this is a great guide to restaurants in the area. Seems like citysearch has been destaffing its Seattle guide, it has become pretty useless for finding restaurants in town. This is a much better guide.
