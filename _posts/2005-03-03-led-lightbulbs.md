I am a big fan of non-incandescent light bulbs -- I am moving the whole house slowly to lower power/lower heat alternatives. I found [these LED bulbs](http://www.cyberguys.com/templates/searchdetail.asp?T1=250+0176&dept=&search=&child=) recently and tried a couple.

Not ready for primetime. Light is too directional, too blue, and not bright enough. But great for places like the garage where those problems aren't an issue.
