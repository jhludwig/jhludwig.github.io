Scandinavia week, I may be visiting the area this fall:

\* "Modern-day Vikings":amazon by Christina Johansson Robinowitz and Lisa Werner Carr. Subtitled as a practical guide to getting along with Swedes, this book is a brief guide to Swedish history, culture, and manners. A quick and interesting read. 4.5 stars on Amazon, not sure any book in this genre can really be a 4.5 star book, but a useful book. \* "Denmark - Culture Smart!":amazon by Mark Salmon. Not quite as good as the book above but still useful. \* "City Of My Dreams":amazon by Per Anders Fogelstr√∂m. Purportedly a popular novel in Sweden, the tale of a young man coming to Stockholm and living his life during the very early days of the industrial revolution. A poor brutish but honorable existence, with moments of hope, joy, and kindness. A very human tale, 4.5 stars on AMazon. I liked it, much more readable and less overwritten than say Dickens.
