**Color Scheme Designer**. Might be worth trying to figure out color schemes for pages since I have no abilities in this domain -- [download page at myWebAttack](http://www.mywebattack.com/gnomeapp.php?id=105677). OK I tried it. Pretty cheesy software. Not clear that it is smarter than I am by far on color choices.
