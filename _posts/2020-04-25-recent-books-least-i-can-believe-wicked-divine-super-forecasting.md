Cleaning up the bookshelf during the pandemic -- a little eclectic.

- [What's the Least I Can Believe and Still Be a Christian](https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Least-Believe-Still-Christian-ebook/dp/B00AZ3W2IU) by Martin Thielen. I was raised Presbyterian but it didn't really take. I still tho got a lot of value out of this book, particularly the first half which debunks some of the worst behaviours of some "Christians". Recommended for believers and non-believers both.
- [The Wicked + The Divine](https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Divine-Vol-Faust-Act-ebook/dp/B015X9BE8Y) by Gillen, McKelvie, Wilson, Cowles. I try a graphic novel every so often and this got good reviews. Didn't really catch my attention, jumped in midstream to the characters and I didn't ever bond to any of them.
- [Super Forecasting](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock-ebook/dp/B00RKO6MS8) by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner. Great book about forecasting and leadership. The basic rules resonate across so many fields -- be tangible; measure performance; iterate. Really nice work.
