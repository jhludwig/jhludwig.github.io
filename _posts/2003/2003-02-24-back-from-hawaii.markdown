**Back from Hawaii**. I'm back -- had a great 12 days at [Kona Village Resort](http://www.konavillage.com/) -- a long time favorite of ours. and then another 3 days next door at the [Four Seasons Hualalai](http://www.fourseasons.com/hualalai/) -- our first time there, a beautiful place, tho not quite as relaxed and intimate as Kona Village. Great weather, lots of humpback whales, a fun trip up to the caldera, some good stargazing. No Blackberry coverage, no laptop, no internet terminals, no cellphone, no tv for most of the stay -- it was great to disconnect, I am thinking about going internet/pc/tv free on every saturday from now on.
