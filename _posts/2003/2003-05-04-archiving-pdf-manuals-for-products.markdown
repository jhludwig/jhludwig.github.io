Tong has a great idea here -- [Tong Family Blog: Suunto Advizor](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_biking/000876.html "Tong Family Blog: Suunto Advizor") -- archiving the PDFs of product manuals. Man I wish I had done this as a practice, it is so hard to find support info on older products. Gosh it would be nice if this was easy and automatic to do somehow -- like when I buy a new product, I enter some universal product code on my pc, and wham I get the manual archived.
