[PhotographyBLOG](http://www.photographyblog.com/weblog.php?id=P1389 "PhotographyBLOG -:- Home")points to Pixory, another photo sharing app, apparently akin to [Electric Shoebox](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001217.html) which I mentioned last week. BTW the Electric Shoebox team contacted me and were very solicitous of feedback, they seem like good guys.
