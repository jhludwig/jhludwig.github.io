[Gary Burd: NATs and Internet telephony](http://gary.burd.info/space/entry-76.html "Gary Burd: NATs and Internet telephony") -- Gary points out that some VOIP developers are struggling with the implications of NATs. Like [Jeremy](http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/2003/09/17.html#a230), I just had a good experience with VOIP -- I was a little surprised when I tried out my Vonage service last night for the first time, and the Cisco VOIP Modem automagically found its way thru the NAT/Firewall with no problems. It was a lot easier than I expected it to be. I have learned to avoid the PC as an end device like the plague for VOIP calling because I've never found PC mics and sound systems to be that great for phone calls, but maybe that situation has improved since last I tried. But using regular phone handsets with the Cisco modem supplied by Vonage was painless.
