Met [Frank Boosman](http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/000845.html "pseudorandom: Meeting John Ludwig") this week -- great guy, anyone who even remotely compares me to Tiger Woods and Yao Ming is ok by me. Oh and by the way there are other great ex-MSFT VCs too -- my partners here at [Ignition](http://www.ignitionpartners.com) for instance, or Pete at [Second Ave](http://www.secondave.com/SecondAvePartners.html), and many others I am forgetting.
