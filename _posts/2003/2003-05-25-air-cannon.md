We don't care for most of the items sold at[Gore Galore](http://www.gore-galore.com/ "Gore Galore manufactures haunted house props, haunted house supplies, halloween props, halloween masks, costumes, corpses, special effects, body forms, halloween supplies") because we try to run a PG-rated Halloween event, and we are just not into monsters and gore. But the [air cannon](http://goregalore.hypermart.net/images/Da_Boom_Air_Cannon.jpg) they are going to offer is right up our alley, this would be a super cool addition to say our pirate scene.
