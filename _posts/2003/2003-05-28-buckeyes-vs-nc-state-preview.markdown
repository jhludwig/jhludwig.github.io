Only 90-some days til the home opener -- and here is a nice preview of one of the games this fall -- [Perspective Piece - NC State vs. Ohio State](http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2003/Preview/MZ/PPNCStatevsOhioState.htm "Perspective Piece - NC State vs. Ohio State"). My favorite part of this article -- _please, let's not think that Washington has a snowball's chance in a furnace of matching the Bucks for toughness and resilience; the marshmallow-soft Huskies should get summarily throttled by "Gray"_
