Like [Tim](http://endofthebench.blogspot.com/2003_11_01_endofthebench_archive.html#106869113335192364), I'm also on the Flip bandwagon. And starting to get excited about the Sonics -- winning back to back on the road is hard. My expectations were low low low after the Collison and Ray Allen injuries, but the Sonics are getting great play from everyone else on the team, particularly Flip. As was mentioned on [Sports Radio](http://www.kjram.com) this am, the absence of Ray may be a blessing in disguise, as everyone else is having to step up and learn how to do more.
