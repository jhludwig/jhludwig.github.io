Dave says [they need a CEO and new management team, maybe they are for sale.](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/07/08#When:1:25:46AM "Scripting News in Manila") John Robb [left](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/07/07#When:1:21:54PM), and now [his blog has been wiped](http://jrobb.userland.com/) so you can't read his statements about his leaving. Seems like a soap opera.
