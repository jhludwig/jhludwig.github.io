[Falcons Enter Saturday's Game Fearless](http://www.go-bucks.com/football/2003/BowlingGreen/falconsnoscared.htm "Falcons Enter Saturday's Game Fearless") -- BGSU has the top-rated offense in the company, they have already beat Purdue at West Lafayette, and perhaps the biggest motivator -- many of the players at BGSU were probably spurned by OSU and would love to take OSU down a notch. These intra-state games have been tough for OSU every year, this one will be no different.
