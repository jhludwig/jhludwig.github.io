[Pac10 College Football - Fanblogs.com: Pride Came Then The Fall (The Story of USC)](http://www.fanblogs.com/pac10/archives/000392.php "Pac10 College Football - Fanblogs.com: Pride Came Then The Fall (The Story of USC)") -- USC clearly celebrated a little too soon this past weekend. From Sunday's LA Times coverage of the game: ?_When you get on a streak...you get to thinking it can never happen,_? Carroll said. ?_It can. You can get beat.?_

Oregon fell prey to complacency as well this week. ?_We were still thinking about the Michigan game and I don't think we were fired up_,? Oregon receiver Sammie Parker said. ?_Everyone is usually fired up in the locker room, but we were really quiet today. We were just kind of waltzing around and I don't think we were ready to play_. ?

Now the Pac-10 is basically out of the national championship hunt. A lesson to all the other teams and conferences out there.
