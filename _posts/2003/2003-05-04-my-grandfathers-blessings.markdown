I'm halfway thru [My Grandfather's Blessings](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1573228567/qid=1052071573/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-2670430-9495005?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) by Rachel Naomi Remen. What a great book, very inspirational, recommended to me by C. Best read a bit at a time I think, a reading or two every morning would be a good dosage.

I just finished a reading concerning fear, certainty, and control. The basic point being there is no certainty in life, so get over your desire for it. A great quote from [Roberto Assagioli](http://www.aap-psychosynthesis.org/Assagioli.html) in this reading -- _"There is no certainty; there is only adventure. Even stars explode."_
