BTW I'm aware that my comments are semi-broken. If you try to leave one, you will receive an error message about not have permission. in fact the comment is captured, but i don't currently allow the actions of anonymous users to cause a rebuild of my index pages. i am thinking about ways around this, need to look for other commenting packages that people have used.
