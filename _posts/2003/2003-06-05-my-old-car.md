Hey make an offer on it now before it is gone -- [Park Place Ltd., Sales Department](http://www.parkplaceltd.com/webinventory/details.asp?id=1774 "Park Place Ltd., Sales Department"). I love this car, rides like a dream, but ultimately, it just wasn't me.

To wit: Last year at Halloween, I was at Home Depot picking up some 10' lengths of PVC pipe, for my [floating lantern](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000703.html) project. So there I am in the parking lot, running 10' lengths of PVC pipe from the front passenger foot well out the left rear window. This made the Jag look really classy.

A guy walks by with his wife, observes my loading, notes the [Ohio State](http://www.ohio-state.edu/index.php) alum sticker in my window, and says sotto voce to his wife: "_Isn't that just like a guy from Ohio. He buys the nicest car he can buy, and then he loads it up with lumber."_

Made my day!
