[The Chronicle: 6/6/2003: Scholars Who Blog](http://chronicle.com/free/v49/i39/39a01401.htm "The Chronicle: 6/6/2003: Scholars Who Blog"), pointed to by some of my friends at [Forest Ridge](http://www.forestridge.org). Good discussion, much worrying about whether blogs are just a fad. Maybe the current technology is a fad, but self-expression and self-publishing seems pretty durable.
