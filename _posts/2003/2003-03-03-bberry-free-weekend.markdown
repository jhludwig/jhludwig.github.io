**BBerry Free Weekend**. Left the [BBerry](http://www.blackberry.net/) on my nightstand this weekend. How refreshing! I have been a slave to email, you start to get driven by your inbox and forget what your goals really are. It was great to be free, I am going bberry free every weekend from now on. And another huge benefit -- my family is much happier!
