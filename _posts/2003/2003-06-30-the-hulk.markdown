This movie is in trouble. While watching [The Hulk](http://www.hulkmovie.com/ "The Hulk - Smashing Into Theatres June 20, 2003"), two 20-something guys in the theater fell asleep and were snoring. When your core market for comic-based movies can't stay awake thru the film...

Contrast with [Bend It Like Beckham](http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/benditlikebeckham/) which was just great.
