Ok I previously mentioned[Ridemax](http://www.ridemax.com/ "Disneyland - Spend Less Time in Line") which is software to optimize your time in Disneyland. We tried it out and I have to say it seems to be a winner. We hit way more rides than we normally have and never felt ourselves to be standing needlessly in line. We were kind of in shock about how well the day went. Definitely worth trying.
