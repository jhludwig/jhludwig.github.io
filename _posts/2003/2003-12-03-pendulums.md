Last night's homework was on Pendulums -- good site here -- [Period of a Pendulum](http://online.cctt.org/physicslab/content/Phy1HON/lessonnotes/pendulums/period.asp "Period of a Pendulum") -- I had forgotten that, for simple pendulums, the period is basically independent of the mass -- cool! Overall this is a high quality site for basic physics info.
