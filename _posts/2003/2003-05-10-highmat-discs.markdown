HighMAT and Microsoft have just announced HighMAT CD Writing and Viewing software for Windows XP -- [20030507 Lockergnome Digital Media](http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/digitalmedia/20030507.html "20030507 Lockergnome Digital Media"). I agree with the Lockergnome analsys -- I've read the HighMat site three times now and I still can't figure out why I would want to be creating HighMAT media.
