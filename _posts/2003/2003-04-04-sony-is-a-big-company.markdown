I just found this site -- [Screenblast](http://www.screenblast.com/screenblast2/index.idml?identifier=mainroot&idmltype=ui "Screenblast") -- a full range of video/picture/sound editting software, a lot of it looks rebranded. And the big company angle? Well this software looks to be completely different than the [software that comes bundled with the Vaio PC line](http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start;sid=JcGFU-elK1iFYtko6f2PWKiqisWdt8Er00o=?CatalogCategoryID=194KC0%2eN7oAAAAD0n2q0sFhP&Dept=cpu&TemplateName=item%2fsy_item_b&ProductID=F2YKC0%2eNa_kAAAD02xK0sFhS&ContentItemPage=).
