[Fittings, Inc.](http://www.fittingsinc.com/ "Fittings, Inc. Home page") seems to be the place to get pneumatic gear (fittings, hose, valves, cylinders, etc) here in Seattle. They look a little odd at you when you start talking about building animated Halloween props, but they have all the right gear.
