As one of the Amazon reviewers says, [Passage](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553580515/qid=1061766790/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-5693187-3796024?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: <i>Passage</i>") is a "fascinating topic, so-so novel" which "seems bloated and frequently dull". I liked the _Doomsday Book_ by this author (who didn't), but _Passage_ was trying.
