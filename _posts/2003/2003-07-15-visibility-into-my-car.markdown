[Dana points to the CarChip](http://www.corante.com/mooreslore/20030701.shtml#44645 "Moore's Lore: new technology. Computing, connectivity, mobile, convergence, communications, software, etc."), a digital recorder you can plug into the standard interface in a car and collect diagnostics. Looks like fun! A great holiday gift for geek friends.
