I'm curious to know what I can do with my Cisco ATA Voip interface box provided by Vonage. [Shawn Djernes](http://www.djernes.org/~shawn/ata186.htm "Asterisk") has a little how-to on getting to the web interface, tho I am worried that Vonage has password-protected it. Here's a [hack from last year](http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/5PP0G0K75U.html) that might let me in, I don't know what firmware I have tho. Anyone have any recos on how to look into the box?  
  
Update: some more good links over on dslreports like [this guide to configuring the cisco ata186](http://www.iconnecthere.com/nonmembers/eng/accessories/accessories_ata.html).  
  
Well dang, none of these work, because they are all specific to version 2.14 or lower of the firmware and i am on version 2.16. Still digging...  
  
Update: the cisco site has some more [documentation on](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/gatecont/ps514/products_configuration_example09186a00800c3a50.shtml)...seems like maybe i should try accessing the device thru the IVR and perhaps opening up the device for web config.
