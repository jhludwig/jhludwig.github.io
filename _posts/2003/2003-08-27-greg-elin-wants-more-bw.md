[Bring On The Bandwidth](http://duhblog.com:8668/duhblog/space/2003-08-27#Bring_on_the_Bandwidth "DUH BLOG :: 2003-08-27") -- start wanking away on DV files -- just one tape in raw format from my canon gl1 is 25G in size. Totally a pain in the ass just to transfer around the house, let alone moving it across the WAN. I'm a huge believer in ongoing demand for bandwidth, especially for consumer apps.
