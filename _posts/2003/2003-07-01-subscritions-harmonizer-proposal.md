Dave has an idea for a [Subscriptions harmonizer](http://www.xmlrpc.com/subsHarmonizer "In progress: Subscriptions harmonizer") so that you can use multiple aggregators. I'd certainly be a customer. I kind of solve it today by using Newsgator which I leave running all the time at work; and then I use Outlook Web Access to browse my aggregated news folders from home. It works ok but it doesn't let me use arbitrary aggregators at home, or keep sub lists in sync across multiple aggregators.
