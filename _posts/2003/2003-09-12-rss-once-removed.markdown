A feature request for my aggregator -- [NewsGator - the RSS news aggregator for Outlook](http://www.newsgator.com/ "NewsGator - the RSS news aggregator for Outlook") -- I'd like to be easily able to see the RSS feeds of the sites to which I am subscribed. E.G. I have a subscription to the feed from [MediaSavvy](http://mediasavvy.com/), I'd like to also see the feeds from the blogroll on MediaSavvy. I want my aggregator to auto-discover the list of feeds and go gather their most recent headlines on my demand.  
  
Back in the day when I used to actually visit blogs, it was easy to discover new websites by occasionally walking thru their blogrolls. With aggregators, I lose that behaviour as I rarely go to visit the sites, and so my reading list gets stale and static.
