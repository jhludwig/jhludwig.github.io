[RCN offering home networking packages : Small Net Builder](http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/News_story_268.php "RCN offering home networking packages : Small Net Builder : Real Help for Your Small Network from Tim Higgins") -- I wonder how successful this will be. And what the margins on the business for RCN will be. My friends at [pure networks](http://www.purenetworks.com) have been thinking about software to automate all this work, I wonder if that is a viable business.
