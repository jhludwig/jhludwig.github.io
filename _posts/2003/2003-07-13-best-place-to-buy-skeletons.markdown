I post this every year or so but always worth a reminder -- this is the site at which to buy skeletons or parts of skeletons -- [The Bucky-n-Thrifty Boneyard Bargains Page](http://www.boneyardbargains.com/ "The Bucky-n-Thrifty Boneyard Bargains Page - Rus Hardy") -- the bags of bones at $2 a pound are always handy -- pick up 10 or 20 pounds today!
