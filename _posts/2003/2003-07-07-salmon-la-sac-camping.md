We were up at the Salmon La Sac campground this weekend (see [Cle Elum Campgrounds](http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/wenatchee/recreate/camping/clecg.htm "Cle Elum Campgrounds")) and it was a wonderful area. A great wading and swimming river, one of the best swimming and diving holes we have seen -- you jump from the bridge entering the campground into the river, it seems plenty deep. A beautiful place.
