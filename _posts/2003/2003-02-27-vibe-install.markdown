**Vibe Install**. After reading [Walt's glowing review](http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/solution-20030226.html) of [vibe](http://www.sharethevibe.com/) yesterday in the [Journal](http://www.wsj.com), I downloaded and tried today. The download and install were fine but I hit a brick wall -- it requires a static IP address. Ouch, that seems like a pretty big mistake.
