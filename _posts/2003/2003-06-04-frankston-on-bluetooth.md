I generally agree with [Bob Frankston](http://www.satn.org/#200381233 "SATN.org: Comments from Bob Frankston, David Reed, Dan Bricklin, and others") that Bluetooth is troubled. But I did manage to make my first use of Bluetooth yesterday -- I sent a picture from my [Nokia 3650](http://www.nokiausa.com/phones/3650) to his t68i and it worked amazingly. And then he sent a business card back and it worked.

The #1 way I'd use this would be to transfer entire phonebooks between phones if this was possible. Right now the phones just let you send single contacts at a time, this sucks.
