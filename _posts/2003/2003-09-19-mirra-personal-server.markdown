[Mirra Personal Server Debuts](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1274131,00.asp?kc=PCRSS02129TX1K0000530 "Mirra Personal Server Debuts") -- I love the product concept, a box that handles all my home or small business storage issues. It will live and die based on the quality of the software -- if accessing the files is funky, or if the backup is errorprone, or if it causes my file access to slow way down, then it will fail.
