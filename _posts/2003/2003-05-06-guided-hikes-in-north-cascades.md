I'm looking for some good guided hike trips in the north cascades. [Cascade Corrals](http://www.courtneycountry.com/hike.html) seems to offer some good trips -- and you don't have to carry a pack. [Sun Mountain Lodge](http://www.sunmountainlodge.com/summer.html) has some packages with a little cushier accomodations. [Canadian Expeditions](http://www.canadian-expeditions.com/welcomeframe.html) has some more rigourous trips up in BC. I think I'd prefer the Cascade Corrals level of exertion and rusticism.
