Back from Banff. Great time, wonderful weather. A little smokey some days due to the forest fires in BC, Alberta, and Montana. As always, got some reading done on vaca. [Did Monkeys Invent The Monkey Wrench](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684832747/qid=1060809534/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_2/103-6210435-2967010?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Did Monkeys Invent The Monkey Wrench") -- moderately entertaining, I know more about the origin of such classics as the Vise-Grip wrench now. [The Left Hand of Darkness](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441478123/qid=1060809677/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-6210435-2967010) -- this has aged very well, still a great read. [Blood Meridian](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679728759/qid=1060809748/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-6210435-2967010?v=glance&s=books) -- couldn't put it down, what great language, how did I miss this all these years? [The Calcutta Chromosome](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380813947/qid=1060809830/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-6210435-2967010?v=glance&s=books) \-- a good read, not your normal scifi fare, but personally I think Tim Powers has done the supernatural-world-spanning-conspiracy-all-around-us better.
