[SEC College Football - Fanblogs.com: Vandy Eliminates Athletic Department](http://www.fanblogs.com/sec/archives/000284.php "SEC College Football - Fanblogs.com: Vandy Eliminates Athletic Department") -- this seems dumb. Running an athletic program is a significant body of work, quite distinct from that of running an educational program. NCAA rules and regulations, budgeting, facilities, recruiting -- it is all different than what your normal university administrators deal with. One way or another you are going to have dedicated staff focusing on the issues; denying their existence is not going to help the quality or professionalism of the effort.
