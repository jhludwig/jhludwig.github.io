I mentioned [this](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000279.html) a while back but here is some more press on MIT's Open Courseware -- [Wired 11.09: MIT Everyware](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/mit.html "Wired 11.09: MIT Everyware"). What a great great initiative. I want to work my way thru some of these courses in the next year -- I haven't taken a college level course in years, I need to dip my toe back in the water. As my grandfather [Cleo](http://users.ipfw.edu/zeppp/Nature/provid.html) says, "the day you stop learning is the day you start dying."
