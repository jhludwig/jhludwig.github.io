Kevin expects the laptop market to collapse -- [VentureBlog: The End Of The Laptop?](http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000212.html "VentureBlog: The End Of The Laptop?") -- a view I empathize with, tho for different reasons. Personally I have quit buying laptops because a) their price/performance is dreadful compared to desktops; b) they suck for playing games; c) i don't really want to haul all my data around all the time, i want it to be ubiquitously available (kevin's server idea); d) they are fragile as hell and expensive to keep running; e) my blackberry is good enough for computing when i am out and about. I can see buying a super-blackberry that can do more, but I will never go back to a laptop.
