[Amazon.com: Books: Bioinformatics for Dummies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764516965/qid=1059970722/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/103-6178200-5387869?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Bioinformatics for Dummies") -- I guess "Dummies" is a relative term. In this case it means "People with advanced degrees in molecular biology who want to learn how to use the various internet-based bioinformatics analysis tools". An interesting read but the terminology was way beyond my high school biology. Basically tho bioinformatics seems to be an amalgam of db programming, string processing, and some probability/statistics. I certainly understand better now why people would want to create a [Bioperl](http://www.bioperl.org) project.
