Looking for self defense courses in the area. [Home Alive](http://www.homealive.org/classes.htm "Home Alive: Classes") seems like the best organization in terms of affordability and time commitment. [BCC](http://at-campus.net/bccsched/index.html?print=/bccsched/output/course_7152.htm) has some courses too. [Insights Training](http://www.insightstraining.com/ps/courses/unarm/usd.htm) seems like it might be for harder core people, some parts of the website scare me. A lot of the martial arts studios offer courses as well such as [this one](http://www.artofdefense.com/index.htm#wo_fr.htm&wo_myths.htm).
