**Pneumatics for Halloween**. A pointer to a good pneumatics primer on my [Halloween at the Ludwig House](http://www.theludwigs.com/radio/2003/02/26.html) blog. I'm thinking that a pneumatics project will be my big effort this year. I'd like to learn about the gear and my feeble attempts at animation last year (small motor driven) basically sucked.
