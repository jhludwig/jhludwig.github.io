We've raised our own personal terror alert to [Blue](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020312-5.html "Homeland Security Presidential Directive-3") -- we are "guarded". We had three police cars in our driveway this morning, after 3-4 young people celebrating a 21st birthday got out of hand, broke into the boat locker in the park next door, stole a canoe, landed at our dock, and wandered thru our yard to the street at 6:45am. Unfortunately they parked their car at the park, and were nicely caught on a security camera, so they spent the remainder of the day in jail.
