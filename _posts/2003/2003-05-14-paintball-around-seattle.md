We've been getting into paintball a little. Just finding a field in the seattle area is tricky. There are a lot of really stale pointers to fields on the web. [Splat Attack](http://www.splatattackonline.com/field/ "Splat Attack") appears to be the place to play south of town. [STP](http://www.stpfield.com/) is the place north of town. A "paintball portal" for the northwest is [PaintballNW](http://mortonwebdesign.com/PaintballNWmenu.htm).
