Hmm I thought this was already established fact but here's some new confirmation -- [Slashdot | Haunted Houses Explained: Infrasound](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/08/1042217 "Slashdot | Haunted Houses Explained: Infrasound") -- I'm not sure how exactly to create infrasound in my Halloween setup -- maybe just a subwoofer with a signal generator emitting a <15Hz signal?
