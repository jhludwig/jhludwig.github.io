Here's the transcript -- [](http://www.go-bucks.com/football/2003/NCstate/geigertranscript.htm)\-- Andy seems quite testy in the interview, this has clearly been a trying process for the school. And I am sure he is still worried about the implications for the school and program -- there is a strong denial in the interview that this will affect the school in any way but I am sure it is a concern.
