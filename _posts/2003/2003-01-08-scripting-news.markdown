**Dave wants us to build directories**. I like the core idea here, my [Halloween blog](http://www.theludwigs.com/Halloween/halloween.html) is basically a directory of useful Halloween links -- [Scripting News](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/01/08#When:8:36:03AM)

> _If I had a billion dollars I'd pay each of you $10,000 to read this page carefully, think about it, and then get started building a directory for each of three subjects you're passionate about and knowledgable of_

I've been unhappy with standard blog tools as the way to build my halloween page, because a date organization is just not interesting. Maybe i should be building it as fundamentally an XML site and worry about html-ization of it later.
