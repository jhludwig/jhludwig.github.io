**Pneumatic Circuit Software**. I'm trying to find some software to help me calculate loads, capacities, latencies in pneumatic circuits. Up at [FluidPower.net](http://fluid.power.net) they have lots of pointers to various packages but they seem more academic and less engineering-oriented, or they are expensive industrial control packages. [Automation Studio](http://www.automationstudio.com/english/html/professional/) looks pretty cool actually -- but there is no price listed, you have to contact them for a quote, that means $$$$$. Autocad has pneumatic symbols but it doesn't look to me like it does the calculations (and I don't want to pay that much). Nothing on [download.com](http://www.download.com), nothing on [sourceforge.net](http://www.sourceforge.net). There must be some cheapo package somewhere that universities use -- couldn't find much tho at the [UW fluid mechanics course site](http://faculty.washington.edu/forster/classes/me333/). I guess I have to calculate my Halloween circuits by hand -- I am going to have 10 loads of various sorts with various duty cycles, I was hoping for some software that would calculate reservoir tank needs and compressor size needed based on input configuration, duty cycles, cylinder sizes, etc.

[Fluidraw](http://www.festo.com/INetDomino/coorp_sites/en/8157963c12bb991cc1256b570034a693.htm) is another option I just found. Seems to be more a drawing package tho than an analysis package. But a good site on pneumatics.
