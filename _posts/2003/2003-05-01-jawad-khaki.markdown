Congrats Jawad on your [national award](http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=cronkiteaward29e0&date=20030429&query=jawad).

I remember vividly my first business trip with Jawad. We were down at 3Com. In the middle of the meeting, he excused himself, pulled his prayer mat out of a bag, oriented himself in the conference room, performed his devotions, and then rejoined the meeting. I was so impressed with this -- someone who had such confidence in and commitment to their values. I have been a huge fan of Jawad's ever since.
