**Top Selling Digital Cameras**. Interesting to look at this -- at [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/new-for-you/top-sellers/-/photo/281052/ref=p_hp_rs_1_1/104-6694531-1231959), clearly weighted towards the $150-300 price range. 6 Canon, 5 Sony, 4 Olympus, 3 Kodak, 3 Fujifilm, 2 Minolta, 1 Nikon, 1 Sipix in the top 25. The [Walmart top seller list](http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product_listing.gsp?cat=4468&path=0%3A5426%3A3959%3A4468) is a little different -- 4 Canon, 3 each of Kodak, Olympus, HP, 2 each of Nikon, Vivitar, Fujifilm, and Sony, and then 1 each fo Toshiba, Meade, Concord, Minolta. I need to check some retail locations too to see what is selling.
