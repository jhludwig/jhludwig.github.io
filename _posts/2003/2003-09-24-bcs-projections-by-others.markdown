Rich Tellshow also does BCS projections -- [Bowl Championship Series Standings](http://www.geocities.com/rtell/main.html "Bowl Championship Series Standings") -- his top 5 is the same ordering as mine, the only big difference is I have OSU and USC being very close in points, while he has a real spread. The difference is in the computer rankings section, where he must have a very different Massey estimate than I do, or a different estimate for other computer polls. Or is he not throwing out the high for each team? His projections are discussed [here](http://denim.bbboy.net/rtsbcsmessageboard-viewforum?forum=1).
