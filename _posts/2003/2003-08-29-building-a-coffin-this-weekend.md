I'll be building a coffin this weekend. Lots of plan choices to choose from. Between [Google](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=coffin+plans) and the [MonsterList](http://markbutler.8m.com/monsterlist.htm) there are plenty of plans to start from: [Casa de Sade](http://home.earthlink.net/~casadesade/coffinplans/), [Full Coffin](http://www.deviousconcoctions.com/fullcoffinpart2.htm "Full Coffin"), The [Body Slinger](http://www.scaryguys.com/slinger.htm), the [Casket Jumper](http://hauntedresources.8m.com/howto/casket/Casket.html), [Scott's How-To](http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Nebula/6037/coffin.htm).  
  
I'm reading all these plans tomorrow and then I'll form my own. Definitely will be animating the lid.
