I bought [Links 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/games/links2003/home/default_2.asp "Links 2003") and installed recently, wanted to see what state of the art in golf games was. This can't be it. Buggy as crap -- hard to finish a round without a crash. And compared to a modern 3d accelerated game (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament, etc), this is such a slow game. It renders a static background, a player moving, and a little white ball flying thru the air -- a pathetic amount of motion and detail compared to one of these other games. And yet it takes Links sometimes as much as a minute to render the next scene. What is it doing?

[Tiger Woods 2003](http://www.gamers.com/game/1254815) is reputedly a better game.
