Great dinner at [Place Pigalle](http://www.seattleweekly.com/food/search_return.php?restaurant=1060&formtype=food&x=17&y=16 "SeattleWeekly.com - search") this weekend -- we hadn't been there in like 10 years and it is still a great restaurant in a great setting. Certainly one of my top recommendations for a night out in Seattle.
