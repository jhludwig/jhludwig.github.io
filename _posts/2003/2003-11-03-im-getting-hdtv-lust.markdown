Between [Rich's posts](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_home_theater/001170.html) and the incessant promos for Comcast HD during morning drive time on [KJR](http://www.kjram.com/main.html), I am starting to lust for HDTV. Some questions I have -- when will DirecTV HD availability catch up to Comcast? When can I get [HDTV Tivo](http://www.tivo.com/5.3.1.1.asp?article=164)? Are there such things as HDTV-encoded DVDs (I am aware this is a somewhat mangled expression of the idea) and where do I get them and what players play them?
