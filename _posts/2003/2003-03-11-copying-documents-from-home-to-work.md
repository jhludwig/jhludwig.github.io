**Copying documents from home to work**. I copied all my photos from home to work today. Both PCs are always on, on broadband connections. Creating a connection between them tho is so hard, regular humans could never do this. I ended up using the remote terminal goo in Windows XP but what a mindblower this is. Opening up a window on the remote pc, seeing your local drives mapped in crazy new places within this window with funny names -- i can't imagine explaining this to a regular human being. It seems like such an easy task -- copying files from home to work. Why is it so hard?
