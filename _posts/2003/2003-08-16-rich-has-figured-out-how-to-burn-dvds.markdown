Thanks Rich -- [Tong Family Blog: No more coasters...now I need software](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_home_movies/001049.html "Tong Family Blog: No more coasters...now I need software") -- I will probably dive back into this area when the school year starts. I also noticed that PCMag had a recent review on the best vidcap hardware, can't seem to find online, it is the 8/19 edition.
