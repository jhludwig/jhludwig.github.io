I like what [Olivier Travers](http://webvoice.blogspot.com/archives/2003_12_01_webvoice_archive.html#107257011506297072 "Web Voice: internet business models and technical marketing (plus random music and politics) - a blog by Olivier Travers") has to say: "_The cost is so low delivery is basically free on a per-song basis. In the face of changing consumer demand, no matter how hard RIAA members try to stick to their cartel solidarity, the same kind of pricing pressure that is destroying the long distance and international phone call troll tax is going to work in the music business as well._"
