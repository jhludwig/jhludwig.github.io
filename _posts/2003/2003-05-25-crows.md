We love watching the [crows](http://www.crows.net/ "Introduction to crows.net") around our house. They are fascinating birds. They constantly harass the eagles and osprey that fly by -- why do the eagles and osprey put up with it? And they love stormy weather, all the crows come out and play in the wind. Crazy birds.
