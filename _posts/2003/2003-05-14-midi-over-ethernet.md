For future Halloween consideration -- looks like you'll be able to run MIDI over IP -- [IEEE P1639 - Distributed MIDI](http://www.dmidi.org/index.php "IEEE P1639 - Distributed MIDI") -- I'd assume 802.11 would work too. Would be a nice control protocol option, there is lots of MIDI-compatible prop control gear and lighting. And I'd love to be able to use a nice MIDI keyboard as my central control station for Halloween props.
