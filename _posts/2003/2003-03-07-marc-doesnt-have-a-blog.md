**Marc doesn't have a blog**. Via [Scripting News](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/03/06#When:8:32:14AM), marca doesn't have the "time or ego need" for a blog. My paltry traffic level certainly doesn't result in an ego boost! And I get great payback on time spent. Maybe marc is worried that his postings can't stand up to the full light of day (obviously that hasn't stopped me).
