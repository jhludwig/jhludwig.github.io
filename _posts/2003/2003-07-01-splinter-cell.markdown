I told myself that I was never going to buy a Tom Clancy branded game, because I thought that the games probably sucked, the publisher having spent all their money on the name license.

But [Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell](http://www.splintercell.com/us/ "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell") is a seriously good game.
