[Amazon.com: Books: The Time Traveler's Wife (Today Show Book Club #15)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1931561648/qid=1070233316//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/104-7738134-9854363?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: The Time Traveler's Wife (Today Show Book Club #15)") -- wow, wow, wow! This is a great book. The story of a life-long relationship between a man suffering from random time travel events and his wife, and the effects that this situation has on their relationship. Just a wonderful story -- great characters, a beautiful relationship. While time travel is a part of the story, the book doesn't go over old time-travel ground but rather focuses on the relationship and how it evolves and develops. A great holiday gift.
