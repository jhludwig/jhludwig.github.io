[Phil Windley | The Personal Server](http://www.windley.com/2003/11/14.html#a910 "Phil Windley | The Personal Server") -- an intriguing idea. But do I really want to carry all my data around on my person in a somewhat fragile container that I could lose, misplace, etc? I guess if it is just a cache that might be ok but I think I want my source data someplace on the web, backed up, but always available to me. Tho I love the personal server idea too. Confusing.
