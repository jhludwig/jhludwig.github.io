**Gigabit Ethernet NTK - Part 1 : Small Net Builder : Real Help for Your Small Network from Tim Higgins.** [Rich](http://www.tongfamily.com/) turned me onto this, a good [primer on starter hardware for gbit ethernet](http://smallnetbuilder.com/Sections-article41-page5.php). I am going to move to gbenet sometime in the next two months -- copying 25G vidcap files around the lan is no fun. I think tho that I will still have problems as i think my NAS box is based on samba code with a 2G filesize limit -- that is what I get for buying a cheapo NAS.
