I've been wretling with a Dell portable this month that has had intermittent network access problems. I finally hit on a solution kind of randomly and the Dell support forums suggest that maybe it is the fault of the Internet Connection Wizard -- [Re: Inspiron 8500 -- disabling Network Bridge - Inspiron - Network - Dell Community Forum](http://forums.us.dell.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=insp_network&message.id=14403 "Re: Inspiron 8500 -- disabling Network Bridge - Inspiron - Network - Dell Community Forum") -- hard to believe but something clearly did establish a bridge on this machine and it has made networking unreliable. Why would I ever want to bridge networks on my laptop -- sure I supposed there is a geek reason to do it, but why would a "wizard" ever leave me in this config?
