Good conversation about outsourcing to overseas developers at [Due Diligence](http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2003/12/09.html#a474 "Due Diligence"). The distinction between low-level coding work which can be outsourced, and more architecture/design-heavy work which perhaps can't be, is important. I am starting to believe that the boundary is moving in favor of outsourcing as communications and practices improve.
