The new Casios are out -- a review of the EX-S3 can be found following the link at [PhotographyBLOG -:- Comments](http://www.photographyblog.com/comments.php?id=P413_0_1_0 "PhotographyBLOG -:- Comments"); and the new [Z3 with optical zoom](http://exilim.casio.com/z3model.htm) is out. I have loved my current 2megapixel Casio, I am going to have to get one of these.
