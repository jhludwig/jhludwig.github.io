I need a cheap longdistance solution for calls within the US. The calling location is deep inside a building at [Pomona College](http://www.pomona.edu) and cell coverage sucks.  
  
Option A is prepaid cards. Genuine ATT cards are availabe on [ebay](http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?query=at%26t+phone+cards&ht=1&sosortproperty=1&from=R10&BasicSearch=) for about 3.4 cents per minute. Or you can go even cheaper if you go to a site like [CallingCardPlus](http://www.callingcardplus.com) \-- rates down to .5 cents per minute. I am sure quality on some of these cheap plans is iffy.  
  
The location does have 10mbit ethernet and so VOIP is an option -- I wonder what will happen when every student starts using VOIP, I bet the campus net is not engineered for that case. [Free World Dialup - by pulver.com](http://www.pulver.com/fwd/ "Free World Dialup - by pulver.com") is a way to start, seems pretty geeky tho, you have to be a NAT expert -- OK for me but not sure this will work for the caller. I wonder if [Vonage](http://www.vonage.com/) is any easier to use. I definitely want an option that uses a SIP phone or a regular phone, I don't want to use a PC mic and headphones.
