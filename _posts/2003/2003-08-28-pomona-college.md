We were at [Pomona College](http://www.pomona.edu "Pomona College") last week and I have to say, the staff was great, everyone was super helpful. And the fact that the student body is the [2nd happiest](http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/rankings.asp?listing=1022748&LTID=1) student body in the country makes us feel good. Good luck L.  
  
Update: some quick feedback on the Pomona IT and telecom resources. Not much WIFI on campus -- a few access points but it is not pervasive in the dorms, that's too bad. Of course they do have 10Mbit links to all the dorm rooms -- I wonder when they will switch to 100mbit? On the telecom side, the school recommends T-Mobile but I am underwhelmed with the coverage. Word on the street is that Verizon may be the way to go.
