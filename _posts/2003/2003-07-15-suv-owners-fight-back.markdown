[S.U.V. Owners Fight Back](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/15/business/media/15ADCO.html?ex=1373601600&en=494d70a67e88760b&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND "S.U.V. Owners Fight Back") -- We drive SUVs in large part because we want the laws governing momentum to play out in our favor in an accident -- delta-V is a bad thing for your body. I don't love having all these big vehicles on the road but I am not going to unilaterally compromise my family's safety to support a principle. Now I would love to see us as a society remove big heavy vehicles, including semi-trucks, from passenger vehicle roadways, but I am not holding my breath.
