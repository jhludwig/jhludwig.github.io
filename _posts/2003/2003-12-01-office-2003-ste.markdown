As rich mentions, [Office Student and Teacher Edition](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/001234.html "Tong Family Blog: Academic Office") is the way to go for home use of Office. $149 list, permission to install on 3 machines. So $50 a machine, and what do you get? Well the most visible improvement I see is outlook -- outlook 2003 with newsgator is a pretty good way to read all my rss feeds.
