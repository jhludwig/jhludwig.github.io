BTW, if you haven't upgraded your power drill in a while, you really have to get a quick change drill bit set like [Bosch CC2130 Clic-Change 27-Piece Chuck, Drill Bit & Driver Set](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00004R9LC/qid=1067629776/br=1-6/ref=br_lf_hi_6//104-6028273-6074337?v=glance&s=hi&n=552390 "Amazon.com: Tools & Hardware: Bosch CC2130 Clic-Change 27-Piece Chuck, Drill Bit & Driver Set") -- I have a ryobi set personally, it has changed my life. Getting rid of the key a few years back was great, but being able to just click in new bits or drivers is so great.
