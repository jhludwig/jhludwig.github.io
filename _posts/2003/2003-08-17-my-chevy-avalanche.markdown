[Rael hates](http://www.raelity.org/archives/society/trends/auto/suv/idiotic/fu-250.html "raelity bytes") the large pickups on the road and points to stats published by the NYTimes about their impact on others in collisions. I don't love the system we have on our highways, but as long as there are large trucks and pickups on the highway, I personally am not going to put my family at a big mass disadvantage. I'd love it if we all rode bikes everywhere in our society but we don't.
