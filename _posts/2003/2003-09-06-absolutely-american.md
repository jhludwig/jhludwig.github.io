[Absolutely American : Four Years at West Point](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/061809542X/qid=1062911280/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-0568284-1700940?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: Absolutely American : Four Years at West Point") by David Lipsky is a great look at life inside West Point. I knew little about the service academies before reading this book, it is a fascinating read. At times I was impressed with West Point; the values that they try to embed in their students are very admirable. At other moments I worried about the end product, as the students seem to be dehumanized and in some ways lose respect for the rest of citizens of their nation. But a great read, very enjoyable, very engaging as it follows the careers and choices of a set of students.
