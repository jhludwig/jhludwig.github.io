**Blogrolling outage**. Ouch, a brief [blogrolling](http://www.blogrolling.com) outage and my site rendering and responsiveness turned to crap. It's the only blogrolling outage over many months and it was brief so I am not upset about, but I need to look at a smarter way to cache my blogroll on my server so that my site can weather outages.
