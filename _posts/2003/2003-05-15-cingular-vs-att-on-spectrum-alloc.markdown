[Cory Doctorow](http://boingboing.net/2003_05_01_archive.html#200291511 "Boing Boing: A Directory of Wonderful Things") points to public comments on FCC discussions about some spectrum realloc. I like his description of the Cingular and ATT positions -- _I think that the contrast between Cingular and AT&T is especially striking here. AT&T is saying, yeah, we're a telco, this is gonna gore our ox, so we've gone out and bought a different ox. Cingular is saying, dammit, that's our ox, where do you get off goring it?_
