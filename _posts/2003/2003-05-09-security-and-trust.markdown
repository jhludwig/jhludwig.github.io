I like the observations about security and trust at [SATN.org: Comments from Bob Frankston, David Reed, Dan Bricklin, and others](http://www.satn.org/archive/2003_05_04_archive.html#200266264 "SATN.org: Comments from Bob Frankston, David Reed, Dan Bricklin, and others") -- _Humans gain trust by interacting and "getting to know" people. Transparent technologies that make it easy to see what people and companies are up to (in a sense the opposite of firewalls) are what help me trust. I like Reagan's saying: "trust, but verify". It implies that trust requires means for openness, not firewalls and secretiveness_.
