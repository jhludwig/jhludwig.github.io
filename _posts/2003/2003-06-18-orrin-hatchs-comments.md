Orrin is clearly off the deep end here -- I have to agree with the opinions expressed at [Moore's Lore](http://www.corante.com/mooreslore/20030601.shtml#40320 "Moore's Lore: new technology. Computing, connectivity, mobile, convergence, communications, software, etc."), Orrin's support for destroying property to protect copyrights is nearly criminal.
