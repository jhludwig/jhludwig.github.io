**PMA 2003 Software announcements**. A quick review of these -- [Minolta Messenger](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0303/03030207minoltamessenger.asp) lets you add hotspots to photos, an idea we were kicking around yesterday. Not sure it is worth a whole separate app! [Adobe Album](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/adobephotoshopalbum/) gets lots of press -- I hear it blows chunks on large data sets. [Preclick](http://www.preclick.com/index.php) gets some nice press, I am downloading now. It is pretty fast at importing my pictures (about 2000). And it is very fast navigating thru photos -- this may win the speed war! but it has very limited org tools, it is just a reflection of what folders you have created in the filesystem, and then you can add ratings to photos. it has a fast search feature but i think it only searches on titles. and has an "autofix" feature as its only real editting tool -- i kind of like the simplicity here. [Qimage](http://www.ddisoftware.com/qimage/) is supposed to be a killer printing program for photos -- looks kind of geeky. Ulead announced its [latest](http://www.ulead.com/dps/runme.htm) \-- I've never been overwhelmed with Ulead product quality but worth looking at I guess.
