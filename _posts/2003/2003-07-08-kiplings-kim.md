Just finishing [Kim](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140183523/qid=1057685272/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-1133321-7983158 "Amazon.com: Books: Kim (Penguin Classics)") -- Good adventure yarn. I was motivated to chose it based on its inclusion in a list in Book magazine of [great adventure stories](http://www.bookmagazine.com/issue28/adventure.shtml). I was also influenced by [Victor Niederhoffer's](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471249483/ref=pd_bxgy_text_1/104-1133321-7983158?v=glance&s=books&st=*) observation that he only reads books that are least 100 years old, as they have stood the test of time if they are still in publication. So I am making it a point to dip into older literature. The amount of language and style drift in just 100 years or so is pretty amazing, you get a sense of how rapidly our language evolves.
