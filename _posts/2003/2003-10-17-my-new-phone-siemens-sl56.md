I love my new [Siemens SL56](http://www.my-siemens.com/MySiemens/CDA/Index/0,1046,US_en_0_product%253AMW%252FHD%252FHD%252FSL56%252Fdesc,00.html). After screwing around with camera phones for a while and being unhappy with them (because they take crappy pictures, it is hard to do anything useful with the pictures, and the extra functionality just gums up the interface of the phone), I dropped back to a device that just tries to be a good phone. And this is a good phone -- the user interface is the best I have used for a while. Easy assignment of speed dial numbers; speed dial can work for phone calls or websites; one button keyboard lock; good functionality even when closed. And fits anywhere. I don't find the small keyboard to be a problem.
