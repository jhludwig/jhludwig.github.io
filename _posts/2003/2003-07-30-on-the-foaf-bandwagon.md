After reading an interminable number of posts about FOAF at [Marc's blog](http://blogs.it/0100198/), at [Gary Turner's blog](http://weblog.garyturner.net/2003_07_01_archive.html#105916401783525110), at [Joi Ito's Web: Technorati talks FOAF](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/07/21/technorati_talks_foaf.html "Joi Ito's Web: Technorati talks FOAF"), I finally added my FOAF file and informed Technorati of it, using Joi's helpful steps. Apparently I run in a dull crowd because none of my friends have foaf files, so I am not sure what the point is, but i was feeling shamed into creating it.
