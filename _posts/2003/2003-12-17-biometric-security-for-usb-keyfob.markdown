[ClipDrive USB Flash Drive - Portable USB storage devices that plug into any computer or laptop USB port](http://www.clipdrive.com/product_clipdrive_bio.htm "ClipDrive USB Flash Drive - Portable USB storage devices that plug into any computer or laptop USB port") -- cool, makes a lot of sense. If i do carry a huge amount of my data around in an easily losable device, I want some access control on it.

A random related point -- I doubt PCs ever get smartcard readers, but the USB port is proving to be a reasonable alternative for a lot of applications.
