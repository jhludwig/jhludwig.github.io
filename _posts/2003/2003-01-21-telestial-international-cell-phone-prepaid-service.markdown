**Need a phone for a trip to spain**. Thinking about getting a prepaid SIM from [Telestial](http://www.telestial.com/) and then a cheap unlocked phone. [Intouch](http://intouchglobal.com/sale/sale.htm) is another option. There are actually a lot of these sites out there. Hard to understand what the best deal really is. For my needs, it will basically be an emergency phone so small upfront costs seem like the optimal path.
