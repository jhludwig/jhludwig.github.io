An interesting way to transport home movies maybe -- [USB 2.0 Portable Disk with Multimedia Playback Feature](http://www.deltrontech.com/Enclosure/CinemaDisk/cinemadisk.htm "USB 2.0 Portable Disk with Multimedia Playback Feature"). A lot pricier than a firewire or usb2.0 disk, but has the player/decoders built in so you can watch the output on a tv instead of depending on a pc being available. 20G seems a little small tho.
