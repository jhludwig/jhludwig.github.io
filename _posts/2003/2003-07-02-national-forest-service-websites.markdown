Your tax dollars at work over and over and over again. We've been scanning all the national forest websites, looking for trail and camping info. For instance -- [Olympic National Forest - Olympic Peninsula Washington](http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/olympic/ "Olympic National Forest - Olympic Peninsula Washington"), and the [Okanagon National Forest](http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/oka/), and the [Gifford Pinchot](http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/), and the [Mt Baker-Snoqualmie.](http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/mbs/)

Now as a taxpayer, I love all this info online, it is a great resource. But do we really need to have completely different website designs and architectures for every single national forest? This is just a sample of the forests near us, how much redundant effort is happening nationwide?
