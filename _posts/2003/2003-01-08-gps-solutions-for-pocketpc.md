**GPS solutions for PocketPC**. Thinking about picking one of these up -- [MobilePlanet](http://www.mobileplanet.com/listing.asp?cat%5Fid=101&cat%5Fname=Pocket+PC+Devices&pdept%5Fid=23&dept%5Fid=2310&dept%5Fname=GPS+Solutions+) lists a lot of them. Not sure which one to pick -- [Teletype](http://www.teletype.com/pages/gps.html) has euro maps which I definitely want. It is not clear if [Pharos](http://www.pharosgps.com/products/toshiba/PF022.htm) has euro maps. [PocketGPS](http://www.pocketgps.co.uk) seems to be a good review and news site. Pretec and socket and travroute just seem to sell cards with other's software.
