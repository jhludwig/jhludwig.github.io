[GigaOm: Om Malik's Broadband Blog: Cameraphones as scanners](http://gigaom.com/archives/2003/12/cameraphones_as_scanners.html "GigaOm: Om Malik's Broadband Blog: Cameraphones as scanners") -- I love this idea, might actually make the camera on my phone worth something. Of course there is a huge adoption problem in getting everyone to print barcodes on everything but in some domains these exist already. And maybe in the not too distant future, the phone can detect RFID signals instead of reading barcodes.
