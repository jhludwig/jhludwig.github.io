[Broadcast Builder](http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail.php3?fid=1061933724 "FileForum | Program Detail - Broadcast Builder") -- let's you build RSS feeds, might be fun.  
[Argali](http://www.jdlasica.com/blog/archives/2003_09_03.html#001436) \-- app for searching multiple YP sources at one  
[Rss in My Yahoo](http://www.mikemcbrideonline.com/2003_08_31_archives.html#106268016286880392) -- I've seen several pointers to this, kind of cool  
[Auth based on typing patterns](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=4421) -- cool tho I want it to work in reverse -- by default let anyone onto my system but throw them out after a couple minutes if their pattern is unknown  
[SpamBayes](http://www.boosman.com/blog/archives/000895.html) -- I wish there were more server-side solutions so that my bberry didn't get so much spam  
[Spam Fights Back](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001531.html) -- but then maybe Bayesian filtering is going to fail when faced with polymorphic spam  
[Universal cutting CD prices](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/04/business/media/04MUSI.html?ex=1378008000&en=36bdcd421ed5eb1d&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND) -- hallelujah  
[CMU building sense into cellphones](http://people.uis.edu/rschr1/archive/2003_08_31_archive.html#106258624756518857) -- nice to see someone trying to make the phone a better phone, rather than adding all kinds of other useless features  
[Decompilation and copyrights](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001527.html) -- a nice primer  
[CSS sucks](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/001512.html) -- time to replace my browser-safe colour palette with my browser-safe CSS palette  
[DVD burning software](http://www.furrygoat.com/archives/000618.html) -- good list -- ridiculous that it takes 7 pieces of software to acceptably move taped content to a dvd  
[Blogstreet](http://www.blogstreet.com/) -- the swiss army knife for blogs  
[Writings on warfare](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide/001088.html) -- thanks rich  
[File sharing utilities](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/001087.html) -- more great links from rich  
[Blueberry tips](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_wireless/001085.html) -- from rich -- seems like some real problems here
