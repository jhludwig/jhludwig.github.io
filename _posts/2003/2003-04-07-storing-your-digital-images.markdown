There are some interesting products up at [JOBO Digital Product Home Page](http://www.jobodigital.com/index.html "JOBO Digital Product Home Page") for storing your digital images. An i-pod sized device to store them all on hard disk, or a cd device. The nice thing in both cases is no PC needed, you can directly transfer from digital film or camera to hard disk or cd.
