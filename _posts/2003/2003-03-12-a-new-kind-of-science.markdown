**A New Kind of Science.** I'm 200 pages in or so and I have to agree with this reviewer's views -- [Amazon.com: Books: A New Kind of Science](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1579550088/qid=1047541401/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-6694531-1231959)

As a wise friend once observed to me, "most nonfiction books should really be pamphlets", and that seems to be the case here in spades. The first 200 pages have about 5 interesting points -- a powerpoint slide or two would have sufficed.
