The folks were on hand last night at [Ohio Stadium](http://www.ps.ohio-state.edu/police/webcams/index.php?current_webcam=stadium.jpg "The Ohio State University: Eyes on Safety") for the opener. Their report: a beautiful night. Same weather and lighting as the Fiesta Bowl, felt like a continuation. The 900+ member band and alumni band was awesome. The entire game felt like a coronation, it was the first real public showing of the team since the Fiesta Bowl and the crowd was emotional. Maurice Clarett was very active in the first half, jumping up and down on the sideline right behind Tressell. He was more sedate in the second half, almost as if he was told to cool it.
