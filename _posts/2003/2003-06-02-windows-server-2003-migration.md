I upgraded my server today to [Windows Server 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx "Windows Server 2003 Home"). Kind of rocky so far, a lot of events thrown during setup and on reboot, and some troubles getting some services to run. still, http server seems to be alive, tho i can't access the net as a client. Probably should have read the "planning guide" and actually thought about things before I just rammed it on the system. Forgive any rockiness the next couple of weeks as I get things worked out.
