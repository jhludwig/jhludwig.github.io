**The Sonics Could Be Worse**. OK, the Sonics have a history of bad decisions at the center and power forward positions. And you have to lay the blame at Wally Walker's feet. Still though, I guess it could be worse -- [Vin Baker is imploding](http://espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0227/1515095.html) and Shawn Kemp's troubles are legend. We could have stood pat with one of those guys, the team would have been worse.
