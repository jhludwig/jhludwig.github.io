Good read -- [Extreme Mobility](http://www.ozzie.net/blog/stories/2003/07/03/extremeMobility.html "Extreme Mobility"). I'm not sure I like Groove as the answer -- requires too much software on the end nodes -- I am more of a lightweight client guy myself: data stored centrally, ubiquitous access, smart cacheing, a presumption that users are always connected. I am also a fan of the thinking embodied in the [LOCKSS](http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/000844.html) work -- achieve data reliability thru lots of copies.
