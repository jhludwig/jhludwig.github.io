I am a huge fan of reading RSS inside outlook or my mail client of the day, totally agree with [Greg](http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=602 "Greg Reinacker's Weblog - RSS Ubiquity") on this. Now I just need some more features. How about preview of postings from those sites that only publish headlines in their feeds -- i'd love to get the first 3-4 lines of their article right in outlook so I could decide whether or not to go to the site.
