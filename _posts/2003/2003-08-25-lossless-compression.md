Like rich, I am interested in switching to lossless compression for my music files -- [Tong Family Blog: Lossless Encoding](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/001069.html "Tong Family Blog: Lossless Encoding"). I wonder tho how well these work with non-pc devices like my kenwood/phatnoise music keg?
