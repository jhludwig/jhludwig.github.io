**Kavalier and Clay**. Finally reading [Kavalier and Clay](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0312282990/mockerybird/ref%3Dnosim/002-1455654-4521633). About 1/3rd in, enjoying so far. A little reminiscent of [Carter Beats the Devil](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0786867345/qid=1043726129/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-1455654-4521633?v=glance&s=books&n=507846), tho that book is a little simpler at many levels, but still a good read.
