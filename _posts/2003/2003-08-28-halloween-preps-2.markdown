OK it is time to get really serious about Halloween preps. I'm way behind as the summer was so busy. [Door To Door Storage](http://www.doortodoor.com "Door To Door Storage - Self storage, storage facilities and storage units location and free rate quote.") is delivering my two containers of props next week. And I am planning to do a lot more cemetary work this year, some pneumatics work, perhaps a mad scientist lab setup, some ghosts, and some sound system innovations. Going to be a busy fall.
