After reading all the great comments on [Mitch Kapor's Weblog re Switching to Mozilla](http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/000224.html "Mitch Kapor's Weblog: Switching to Mozilla"), I decided to try Firebird. It installed nicely and seems really zippy.

One big problem area tho is that I get a really poor experience with Exchange2k Outlook Web Access pages; it could be the server deciding that I am an unsupported client and sending me highly defeatured pages. OWA pages with IE make heavy use of DHTML and so I suspect the exchange server is picky about what clients it supports fully.
