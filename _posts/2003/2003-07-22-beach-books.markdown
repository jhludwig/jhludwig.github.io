When I go on a little vacation I always take a bag of paperbacks, books which I don't mind if I leave behind. This last weeks bag of books: [The Braided World](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553583794/qid=1058906348/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-1066094-9124802?v=glance&s=books&n=507846 "Amazon.com: Books: The Braided World") -- OK sci fi with a strangely similar planet to earth; [Link](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380731614/qid=1058906490/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1066094-9124802?v=glance&s=books) \-- so-so action/thriller about the origins of humanity -- not very original; [Curtain](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0425173747/qid=1058906561/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1066094-9124802?v=glance&s=books) by Agatha Christie -- another great Poirot story; [Area 7](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312266855/qid=1058906620/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1066094-9124802?v=glance&s=books), a very entertaining albeit highly improbable action thriller. It didn't break my heart to leave any of these behind at the hotel.
