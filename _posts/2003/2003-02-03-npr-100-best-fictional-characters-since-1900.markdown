**100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900**. Not a bad way to expand my reading list -- [NPR: 100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900](http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html). Not a new list but a good one. (I got here googling for "fictional characters named john" in my never-ending quest to find new and interesting IM handles for myself)
