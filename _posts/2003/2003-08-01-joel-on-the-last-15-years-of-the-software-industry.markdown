[Joel on Software - Rick Chapman is In Search of Stupidity](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Stupidity.html "Joel on Software - Rick Chapman is In Search of Stupidity") -- _According to Rick Chapman, the answer is simpler: Microsoft was the only company on the list that never made a fatal, stupid mistake_. Boy there is a lot of truth in this. During my tenure at MSFT I watched competitor after competitor blow their own foot off -- Lotus, Novell, Netscape, AOL more recently, IBM, etc. MSFT pushed these companies hard in the marketplace but more often than not, it seems like the competitor did themselves in.
