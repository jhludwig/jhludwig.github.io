The switch to [Daylight Saving Time](http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/ "About Daylight Saving Time - History, rationale, laws & dates") sucks. Losing an hour on a Sunday is no fun. C had a great point -- why doesn't the switch happen on a monday late morning or early afternoon? Would any of us regret giving up an hour on monday? Why does it need to be taken out of the weekend?
