Boy a lot of this resonates with me -- [Joi Ito's Web: Going P-time](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/06/going_ptime.html "Joi Ito's Web: Going P-time") -- rss feeds, blog comments are climbing in the priority list while email falls. Couple this with the effect of spam on the utility of email -- email is taking a hit.
