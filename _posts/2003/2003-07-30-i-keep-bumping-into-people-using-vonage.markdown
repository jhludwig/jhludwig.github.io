I have recently been hearing a lot of positive word-of-mouth on [Vonage DigitalVoice .::. The BROADBAND Phone Company...](http://www.vonage.com/ "Vonage DigitalVoice .::. The BROADBAND Phone Company..."). People seem very enthusiastic about. I personally don't quite get it -- within our extended family, everyone has a cell phone with a huge bucket of minutes, they've moved their long distance usage to the cell phone, and so their local phone bill has dropped to the basic $20-30/month level. Thus Vonage has little draw for them. Maybe the excited users are people with a lot of overseas calling?
