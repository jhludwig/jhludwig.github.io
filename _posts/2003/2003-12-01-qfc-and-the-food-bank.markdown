This time of year I really appreciate [QFC's](http://www.qfconline.com/ "Quality Food Centers (QFC)") support of the needy -- they make it incredibly easy to pick up a prepackaged $5 or $10 bag of groceries for the local foodbank. Every time I am in the store I grab one of these bags, it is a great and easy way to provide some help.
