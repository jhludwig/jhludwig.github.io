- [Prezi.com - The zooming presentation editor](http://prezi.com/). Certainly a lot more visually entertaining than your typical PPT
- [Animoto](http://animoto.com/) is a whole different way to go on presentations
- [favorite mac apps per Merlin Mann](http://lifehacker.com/5138144/merlin-mann-takes-a-tour-through-his-menu-bar). Skitch and Path Finder seem useful
- [htmlsql](http://www.jonasjohn.de/lab/htmlsql/?url=0&q1=2&q2=0&q3=3). not sure why I care, just seems cool.
- [TinEye](http://www.tineye.com). Reverse image search.
- [Free MSFT downloads](http://bhandler.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!70F64BC910C9F7F3!1231.entry?wa=wsignin1.0). A ton
- [Starbaron](http://gadgetopia.com/post/6684), a quality time waster.
- [Adobe configurator](http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Why_Adobe__Configurator__Will_Revolutionize_The_Way_You_Use_Photoshop). At least this guy loves it.
