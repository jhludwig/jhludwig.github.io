I picked up a [JVC Interlink 7310](http://www.dynamism.com/7310/pricing.shtml "JVC Interlink 7310 - Pricing") at [dynamism.com](http://www.dynamism.com). A great machine for the kind of portable computing I do -- small, easy to carry around, but a reasonable keyboard and reasonable screen and reasonable performance. I don't understand why this class of machine is not sold in the US market, I had an old VAIO with this form factor and loved it, and I love this one even more.

(I used it Sunday at a Starbucks in some crummy little strip mall and was suprised to find no less than 4 WIFI networks available to me beyond the T-Mobile fee-based network. Starbucks has to be happy, I still went to their store and bought a drink, even tho I didn't use their network).
