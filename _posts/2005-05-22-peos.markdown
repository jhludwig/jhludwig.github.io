From [Ross at Socialtext](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/05/how_to_fire_you.html) -- _"Today I fired the entire Socialtext team. Then I fired myself. We are all pretty happy about it."_ I didn't know much about [Administaff](http://www.administaff.com/index.asp) and PEOs, seems like a great idea.
