- [CircuitLab](www.circuitlab.com) -- worth watching. Today it is kind of a toy, but if this could grow, say, into a tool that would let me design and emulate SOC-based systems, and then outsource the parts supply, circuit board mfr, and even assembly of them, well that could be cool.
- [PaintCode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com) -- if I was doing iOS/osx app development, this seems like a must have. Laying out visuals and then creating all the boilerplate framework is tedious and boring.
- [Pressgram](http://pressgr.am) -- Love this idea. Never understand why people gift content to other branded services, this lets people own and control their own content.
- [Some Ecards Store](http://store.someecards.com) -- I'd like to buy a bunch of the coffee mugs and stock our office with them.
- [Tabular](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/26/tabular-tablature-editor-for-the-mac/) -- I don't have enough time (or, to be honest, enough skill) to engage in my secret desire to compose music, but if I didâ€¦
- [2 factor Apple ID auth](https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/) -- purportedly you can turn this on but it has been a failure for me, apple claims i set some security question answers that i have never seen before, and now I am locked out of my account after too many tries. Awesome.
- [WindowsRT jailbreak tool](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092158) -- something to do with my stupid surface machine
