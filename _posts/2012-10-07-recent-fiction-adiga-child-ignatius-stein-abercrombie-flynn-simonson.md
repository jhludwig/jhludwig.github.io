\* "Major Pettigrew's Last Stand":amazon by Helen Simonson. An aging British major finds love unexpectedly across race and class boundaries. Awkwardness, tragedy, loss, redemption all ensue. An excellent tale. \* "The Blade Itself: The First Law: Book One":amazon by Joe Abercrombie, and the two following books in the series. Does a great job of creating empathy for an unloveable set of main characters -- a torturer, a foppish young swordfighter, two savage killers, an amoral wizard, a drunkard. \* "Gone Girl":amazon by Gillian Flynn. Twisty and fun tale about a missing woman and her husband, the leading suspect. Lots of twists and turns. \* "The Art of Racing in the Rain":amazon by Garth Stein. A story featuring a dying dog dying, a dying spouse, and a terrible custody battle is going to be a downer. But a couple of really interesting characters and some redemption at the end manage to lighten the tale just enough. \* "The White Tiger":amazon by Aravind Adiga. Very engaging novel set in modern India, provides a lot of insight into the many cultures and contradictions of the nation. \* "A Wanted Man":amazon by Lee Child. Reacher novels are always fun, looking forward to the movie. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense but that is not why one reads Reacher. \* "Bloodmoney":amazon by David Ignatius. Now this plot makes a lot of sense and one can totally imagine that some form of this chicanery has taken place. Good characters and good pace.
