Reading [Jon Udell's](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/09/12.html#a795) site reminded me of this new feature of Exchange 2003 -- [Inside RPC-over-HTTP](http://www.win2000mag.net/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=40018 "Inside RPC-over-HTTP"). Seems great for users, absolutely terrible tho for the VPN market -- seems to me like this will decimate the demand for VPNs.
