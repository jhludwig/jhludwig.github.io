This year I read or attempted to read 75 books.  There were some dogs but also some great ones.  I tried to come up with the “best book of the year” but that is pointless, they are all so different.  So I will highlight a number of different books that excelled in different ways. 

**Best Mystery**:  [The Last Good Kiss](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/523795.The_Last_Good_Kiss) by James Crumley.  A solid hard-bitten detective tale, everything you want in a private eye.  

**Best Adventure**: [The Lies of Locke Lamora](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora) by Scott Lynch.  If you like more fantastical adventures, this is a great tale and really ought to be a movie or TV series.

**Best Historical Novel**:  [Washington Black](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38140077-washington-black) by Esi Edugyan.  If you like your adventures a little more grounded in historical reality, this is for you.  Would also be fantastic on screen.

**Best History**: [Kent State: Four Dead in Ohio](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50159458-kent-state) by Derf Backderf.  If you like actual history, this is a great telling of the events at Kent State, and exposes the dangers of involving armed military in civil protests.  Almost chose this for best graphic novel, but for…

**Best Graphic Novel**: [Solutions and Other Problems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51323365-solutions-and-other-problems) by Allie Brosh.  Irreverent, at times hilarious, at times moving.  Well done.  

**Best Irreverent**: [Lamb, The Gospel According to Biff, Christ’s Childhood Pal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28881.Lamb) by Christoper Moore. Irreverent, some may even view as offensive, but I found it respectful and uplifting in a humanist way.

**Best Current Events**:  Getting back to our current situation and lives, there are 3 books that I enjoyed and gave me some insight on myself or the world.  

- [One Billion Americans: The Case for Thinking Bigger](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50165554-one-billion-americans) by Matthew Yglesias.  You might object to his solution but this book clearly focuses on a challenge we face, and it is hard to imagine solutions that don’t involve growth.  
- [The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth) by Eric Beinhocker.  A worthy effort to reexamine economics from first principles.
- [Caste: The Origins of our Discontents](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152447-caste) by Isabel Wilkerson.  There are many books you can read on discrimination and racism in our society, this was the best for me.

**Best Math/Science**.  Digging a little deeper, these were the math/science books that I enjoyed the most this year.  

- [Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36341728-lost-in-math) by Sabine Hossenfelder.  A criticism of current thinking in physics.  I don’t follow physics closely enough to know if this is all warranted.
- [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting) by Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner.  We all forecast in our lives, and we are probably all not that great at it, as this book will make you realize.
- [But What If We’re Wrong? Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27068734-but-what-if-we-re-wrong-thinking-about-the-present-as-if-it-were-the-pa) by Chuck Klosterman.  Challenges your thinking about what you know and believe, which is always good.  

Would love to hear your thoughts on books you read this year.
