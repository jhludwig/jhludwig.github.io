**Fixed site to work with Gecko**. [Gary Burd](http://www.beagledreams.com/) let me know that the default [Sitemeter](http://www.sitemeter.com/) code was making this site unviewable for [Gecko](http://www.mozilla.org/) users, and pointed me to [discussion about](http://climbtothestars.org/coding/vanishingdiv/). I think I've fixed now, thanks Gary.
