Interesting [view on recent tech history](http://www.corante.com/bottomline/archives/000618.html): _If they wanted to be the next Microsoft, Netscape should have looked more closely at how Bill Gates did it -- he kept his mouth shut until it was too late for IBM to respond._ and _Which brings me to what I think is the biggest myth about Netscape, which is that they were a great engineering company. They were a crappy engineering company._
