I'm cleaning some older books off the shelf, and peeking at them as I do:

- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer) by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. 20+ years old, and a little dated in its examples (CORBA?) and quotes (a Bill Cosby quote?), but still a solid source of guidance on very basic software craftsmanship.
- [Refactoring](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring) by Martin Fowler. Hasn't aged as well. In a world of cloud services, asynch programming, containers, this just doesn't seem to line up with the fault lines in modern software.
- [Patterns of Software](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/685486.Patterns_of_Software) by Richard P. Gabriel. I wanted to like this, and I suspect there is some great stuff in here, but too abstract and meta for me
- [Code Complete](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete) by Steve McConnell. Back before Stack Overflow, Github, online notebooks, great doc sites, this may have been a great guide to software development. Still great topics, but doesn't seem like the best way to learn.

And then some new ones

- [They Called Us River Rats](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56686093-they-called-us-river-rats) by Macon Fry. A look at the settlements along the batture in the New Orleans area. What a way to live.
- [The Echo Wife](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52379735-the-echo-wife) by Sarah Gailey. Nicely paced although the purportedly super smart protagonist didn't seem to think that far ahead sometimes -- if you are super good at cloning people and you need to cover up a death, I don't think it would take you more than a nanosecond to consider cloning the dead person.
