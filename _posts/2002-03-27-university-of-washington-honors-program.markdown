**Educational Stuff**. Heading out on some college tours next week. [University of Washington Honors Program](http://depts.washington.edu/uwhonors/) is first on our list, heading there next Wednesday. Then to Occidental Thursday, Claremont and Pepperdine Friday, Caltech and UCLA Saturday, with maybe a stop at USC sometime.

On the home front, recently bought and installed [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/) after wanting to for years. Kind of necessary as I help the kids with high school math homework -- it is getting tougher and tougher for me to keep up. Mathematica is great, going to take me a year to really dig into it.
