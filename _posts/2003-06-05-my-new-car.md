My new car is a [Chevy Avalanche](http://www.chevrolet.com/avalanche/home.htm "Chevy Avalanche â€“ Model Pricing"). Love it, love the fact that it has a fullsize backseat, but can also carry a 4'x8' sheet of plywood or foamboard or whatever for my Halloween projects. I waffled between the Avalanche and its upscale Cadillac twin, but the guys at the Cadillac dealership made me feel like a sucker: "Why exactly is this better than an Avalanche?" "Oh, it is just better." That was all I could get out of the guy.

And it is super functional, a much better match for me than...
