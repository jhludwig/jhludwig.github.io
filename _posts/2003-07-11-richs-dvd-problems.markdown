Rich is digging into DVD burning problems -- [Tong Family Blog: Sony DRU-120A Won't Read DVD9 anymore](http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/000981.html "Tong Family Blog: Sony DRU-120A Won't Read DVD9 anymore") -- this is just one of several posts. Man it sounds like a pain. I know that I have given up on DVD burning on the PC, the software is crap and the hardware is buggy. It just is not worth the time with the current generation of products.
