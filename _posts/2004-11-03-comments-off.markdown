I've had comments off for 4-5 days while i started to move towards typepad registration required ... but i loved not having to deal with comments anymore since they have been 99% crap (either spam or "i need a product key"). i concluded i didn't need them at all. send me mail, or send me a trackback (until trackback spam causes me to turn that off).
