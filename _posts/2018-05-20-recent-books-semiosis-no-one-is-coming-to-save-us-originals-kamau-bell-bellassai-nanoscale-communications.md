- [Semiosis](https://www.amazon.com/Semiosis-Novel-Sue-Burke-ebook/dp/B071RXVGGB) by Sue Burke.  Very good first contact tale, the things we meet might be very very different than us.
- [No One is Coming to Save Us](https://www.amazon.com/No-One-Coming-Save-Us/dp/0062472984) by Stephanie Powell Watts.  Another independent bookstore pick up, waaaay outside my comfort zone, and I just couldn't get thru it.  [![](images/bell-199x300.jpg)](http://theludwigs.com/2018/05/recent-books-semiosis-no-one-is-coming-to-save-us-originals-kamau-bell-bellassai-nanoscale-communications/bell/)
- [Originals](https://www.amazon.com/Originals-How-Non-Conformists-Move-World-ebook/dp/B00XIYGCDO) by Adam Grant.  I expected to hate this as I tend not to enjoy pop business books, or books that justify people being jerks.  But it was better than that.  Useful tools for encouraging creativity in yourself and your teams.
- [The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell](https://www.amazon.com/Awkward-Thoughts-Kamau-Bell-Heterosexual-ebook/dp/B01LZXZK2F) by W. Kamau Bell. Interesting story of a developing comic and his experiences with racism. I need to watch his show on CNN.
- [Everything is Awful](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Awful-Observations-Matt-Bellassai-ebook/dp/B071CTJX14) by Matt Bellassai.  Another book by a comic, and this one is thin gruel after reading Bell above.  Couldn't finish, seemed so lightweight.
- [Nanoscale Communication Networks](https://www.amazon.com/Nanoscale-Communication-Networks-Science-Engineering/dp/1608070034) by Stephen F. Bush.  From 2010, so in this field this is like a billion years old,  but still interesting.  Transport mechanisms, delay characteristics, accuracy are so different at the nanoscale.
