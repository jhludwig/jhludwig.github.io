[The 10 core philosophies of Whole Foods](http://brandautopsy.typepad.com/brandautopsy/2005/10/the_winning_way.html) -- great outline.  I love the food at Whole Foods -- but the whole thing about "Grocery Shopping as Theatre" is bunk.  I don't go to Whole Foods for the transformational experience, I go to buy food.  The thing I hate most about the stores is the stupid non-linear aisle layout.  I am sure some genius somewhere thought that it was really creative but it just creates cart traffic disasters.  There is a reason why other stores all have straight aisles -- they work.
