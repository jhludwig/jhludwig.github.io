I'm a sucker for color pickers -- [Don Park's Daily Habit - Mad About Colors](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=debac645-73e1-4db2-8a63-98cec6c1be90 "Don Park's Daily Habit - Mad About Colors") -- you'd think my site colors would look better. I'm like the bad golfer who keeps buying the latest trimetal, titanium, depleted uranium, carbon fibre club -- I'm sure if I just improve my gear, my skills will automatically improve.
