<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Different-Escaping-Competitive-Youngme-Moon-ebook/dp/B0036S4CNE">Different</a> by Youngme Moon. I hate most business books but this one was refreshing. Relatively agjron free, short, and with a clear point of view about how to innovate and stand out.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dissolution-Shardlake-Novel-Matthew-ebook/dp/B002TZ3EPM">Dissolution</a> by C. J. Sansom. Great Tudor era mystery. Very sorry that TV production on this stalled years ago, this would be awesome.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions-ebook/dp/B00IYUYF4A">What If?</a> by Randall Munroe. The perfect bathroom book.</li>
</ul>
