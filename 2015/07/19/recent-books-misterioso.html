  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misterioso-Crime-Novel-Vintage-Lizard/dp/0307388034">Misterioso</a> by Arne Dahl. I’m not sure what the state of the art in book translation is these days, but I am sure it is heavily automated. This story is ok, but feels like a rush translation job – some strange and stale structuring, some pronoun confusion at times. I suspect the original is better than this.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orenda-Joseph-Boyden/dp/034580645X">The Orenda</a> by Joseph Boyden. Life during the 1600s in the Americas from the viewpoint of a Huron tribe. Fascinating milieu and great characters. Not for the squeamish, life was brutal.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gates-Samuel-Johnson-Tale-ebook/dp/B002QJZ9Y0">The Gates</a> by John Connolly. Suburban idlers accidentally open the gates to Hell, and it is up to young Samuel Johnson to save the day. Kind of funny but forgettable.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rolling-Deep-Mira-Grant-ebook/dp/B00VR2L60S">Rolling in the Deep</a> by Mira Grant. Light Horror, don’t screw around with mermaids, they are not what they seem. Fun, but I mostly read because Grant has done such other good work.</li>
