<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Finders-Keepers-Novel-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B00P42WROG">Finders Keepers</a> by Stephen King. A fine detective novel, but makes me miss the glory days of the author.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Girl-All-Gifts-M-Carey-ebook/dp/B00CO7FLFG">The Girl With All The Gifts</a> by M. R. Carey. Not all zombies are bad. Not all people are good. Maybe we should just let the zombies win.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Pass-Resurrection-Man-Novel-ebook/dp/B00TONI5LU">Snake Pass</a> by Colin Campbell. An attempt to start a Jack Reacher-like franchise, and not a bad attempt. I will read the next.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Novel-Book-1-ebook/dp/B0052RDJAO">Legend</a> by Marie Lu. Yet another post-apocalyptic dystopia. Probably better than most, but I donâ€™t know that I need another series in this genre.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Caine-Riordan-Book-ebook/dp/B00BVBRMDK">Fire with Fire</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trial-Fire-Caine-Riordan-Book-ebook/dp/B00LUXNAYO">Trial by Fire</a> by Charles E. Gannon. Fun space romp with aliens, world-ending threats to humanity, interstellar politics, etc.</li>
</ul>
