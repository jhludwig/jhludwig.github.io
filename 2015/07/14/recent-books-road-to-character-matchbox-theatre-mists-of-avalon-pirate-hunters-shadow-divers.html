  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Road-Character-David-Brooks/dp/081299325X">The Road to Character</a> by David Brooks. The opening essay (largely reprinted in the NY Times a while back) was terrific, but the character studies themselves were only OK. I would have preferred to see some more contemporary stories. Tho the message got through – building great character doesn’t come easily to anyone, it is a lifelong daily struggle, confronting and overcoming the weaker parts of your nature.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matchbox-Theatre-Thirty-Short-Entertainments/dp/194114750X">Matchbox Theatre</a> by Michael Frayn. A quick read, some gems, but grew a little old.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mists-Avalon-Marion-Zimmer-Bradley/dp/0345350499">The Mists of Avalon</a> by Marion Zimmer Bradley. Been on the shelf forever. Good read from a very different viewpoint, I’m not sure I could have waded thru yet another typical retelling of the story.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Divers-Adventure-Americans-Everything/dp/0375760989">Shadow Divers</a> by Robert Kurson. Great true story about deep sea divers after a mysterious U-boat. Great characters, life and death drama, an excellent window into a world I knew little about.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pirate-Hunters-Treasure-Obsession-Legendary/dp/1400063361">Pirate Hunters</a> by Robert Kurson. An attempt to capture the magic again of Shadow Divers. A fine story but pales next to Shadow Divers.</li>
