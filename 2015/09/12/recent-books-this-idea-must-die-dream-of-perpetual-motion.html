<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Idea-Must-Die-Scientific/dp/0062374346">This Idea Must Die</a>, ed. John Brockman. <a href="http://benslivka.com/">Ben</a> pointed me towards this. A bit repetitive, but a lot of pithy observations by very bright people. Will be interesting to revisit in 20 years.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Perpetual-Motion-Playaway-Fiction-ebook/dp/B003A7I2PU">The Dream of Perpetual Motion</a> by Dexter Palmer. Need more mushrooms to enjoy this book. And a greater tolerance for farce.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Dogs-Kent-Anderson/dp/0553578774">Night Dogs</a> by Kent Anderson. This is a rough book – a rough tale, written roughly, edited roughly. All that said, it is compelling though not always easy to stomach.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wraeththu-Storm-Constantine/dp/0312890001">Wraeththu</a> by Storm Constantine. I just don’t know about this. It seems poorly written at times, and a little too mystical, and a little bizarre at times. I haven’t finished but I haven’t given up. It is resting on my desk and I am trying to decide whether to have another go.</li>
