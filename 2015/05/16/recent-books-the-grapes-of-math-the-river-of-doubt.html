  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grapes-Math-Reflects-Numbers-Reflect/dp/1451640099">The Grapes of Math</a> by Alex Bellos. Supposed to be a fun exploration of math in our lives, but I don’t think anyone is going to really like this book. For people that hate math, there is too much math and too little backstory. For people like me who like math, there is too much rehashing of math we already know, and too little backstory.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/River-Doubt-Theodore-Roosevelts-Darkest/dp/0767913736">The River of Doubt</a> by Candace Millard. The story of Teddy Roosevelt’s Amazon expedition after his last failed presidential run. I never realized what an epic disaster this trip was, the team was in no way ready for the rigors of the Amazon. Great tale, makes me both want to see the Amazon basin, and terrified to see the Amazon basin.</li>
