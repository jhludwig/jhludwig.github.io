  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Lord-Bird-James-McBride-ebook/dp/B00AEDDPU0">The Good Lord Bird</a> by James McBride. The story of the abolitionist John Brown told from inside his troop. Engaging and depressing and uplifting.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daughter-Smoke-Bone-Trilogy-Book-ebook/dp/B004QX076Y">Daughter of Smoke and Bone</a> by Laini Taylor. The coming of age of a young art student who realizes that she and her family are actually something quite unnatural and important. This is well travelled road, but a solid tale nonetheless.</li>
