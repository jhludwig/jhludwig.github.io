  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-First-Light-Trilogy/dp/1481440934">The Red: First Light</a> by Linda Nagata. <a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/thered.jpg"><img src="images/thered.jpg" alt="thered" /></a>Very nice near future novel tactical warfare, cyborg soldiers, hacking, ad tech gone crazy, etc.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zero-World-Jason-M-Hough/dp/0553391267">Zero World</a> by Jason Hough. Started out nice with some speculations about a guilt-free mind-wiped assassin, but turned to crap quickly with a really stupid many worlds interpretation. Don’t bother.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Scorpion-Nancy-Farmer/dp/0689852231">The House of the Scorpion</a> by Nancy Farmer. Yet another YA dystopian novel, tho this at least wasn’t in the games/maze/stupid challenge space. Kind of forgettable tho.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nemesis-Harry-Hole-Novel/dp/0062119699">Nemesis</a> by Jo Nesbo. Solid scandinavian mystery, the main character is an appealing misfit.</li>
