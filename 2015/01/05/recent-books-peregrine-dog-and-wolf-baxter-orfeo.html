  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Proxima-Stephen-Baxter-ebook/dp/B00INIJJAI/">Proxima</a> by Stephen Baxter. Settling new planets isn’t for sissies. Unless you find a magic wormhole.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hour-Between-Dog-Wolf-Transforms-ebook/dp/B0074VTH0W">The Hour Between Dog and Wolf</a> by John Coates. Our “rational” behaviour is driven by our physical bodies and emotions in ways we are just understanding. Interesting but drags on.</li>
