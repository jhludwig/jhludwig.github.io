  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Noir-Novel-Robert-Coover/dp/1590202945">Noir</a> by Robert Coover. Noir mystery meets mushrooms. Very strange story. Engaged me but I’m not sure I’d want a steady diet of this.<a href="http://theludwigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lastman.jpg"><img src="images/lastman-195x300.jpg" alt="lastman" /></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Pradeep-Mathew-Novel/dp/1555976115">The Legend of Pradeep Mathew</a> by Shehan Karunatilaka. Very nicely written, but ultimately defeated me. My lack of any cricket knowledge and lack of any Sri Lanka knowledge put me in too deep a hole.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Speech-Child-44-Trilogy/dp/0446402419">The Secret Speech</a> by Tom Rob Smith. Excellent pageturner, not surprising, Smith writes engaging tales.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trinity-Six-Charles-Cumming/dp/B009LRMHZE">The Trinity Six</a> by Charles Cumming. Also a great pageturner, for some reason the hunt for moles inside the British intelligence community never gets old.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-Edgar-Sawtelle-Novel-P-S/dp/0061374237">The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</a> by David Wroblewski. I enjoyed, kind of an extended Greek tragedy set in rural Wisconsin. With dogs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Last-Man-Vol-Unmanned-ebook/dp/B0064W66EC">Y: The Last Man</a> by Brian K Vaughan, Pia Guerra, Jose Marzan Jr. I don’t read many graphic novels but this got such great reviews, and it is a great tale. Every male human and male animal dies off suddenly, except for one, and the race is on to save and recreate the world. This would be a fantastic TV show, tho I’d tame down some of the comic parts a little.</li>
