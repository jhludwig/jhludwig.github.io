<p>3 machines at work, 7 at home, and I occasionally need a spreadsheet on all of them. Office is too expensive and overkill, OpenOffice is overkill. I need something lightweight. Trying out <a href="http://www.byedesign.freeserve.co.uk/">Spread32</a> at the moment. A couple other choices at <a href="http://www.tinyapps.org/">tinyapps</a> as well including <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/history/vcexecutable.htm">visicalc</a>. Actually I’d love a server-based spreadsheet, a self-hosted open source version of <a href="http://www.securesheet.com/">this</a>, so i wouldn’t have to install anything or worry about moving my spreadsheet files around with me.</p>
