<p>I’ve started to eliminate MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger clients from all my machines. Motivated to do so by a couple problems:</p>

<p>* too aggressive toast behaviour, when I am playing a directx game i don’t want any toast thank you. (AIM has this problem too). * poor idle detection. people were sending me messages when i was not at my machine. * wrong strategy for presence detection. messages were going to the wrong machine (I use 4 at work and 5 at home regularly) and i would see messages days after they arrived. AIM has this right, they don’t try to figure out presence, they just MIRV the message to all your signed-in locations.</p>

<p>If you want to IM me, i’m jhludwig on AIM.</p>
