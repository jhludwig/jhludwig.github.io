<p><a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2004/09/turning_commodi.html" title="A VC: Turning Commodity Into Scarcity">A VC: Turning Commodity Into Scarcity</a> – great insight – it is a core challenge for many businesses large or small – I remember back in the days when I worked in MSN, where the ad sales team worked hard to turn the huge inventory of unsold ad space into limited run special opportunities – “be one of our 5 Valentine’s Day partners”, “be one of our 3 premier blah-blah partners” – great work by that team to turn excess into scarcity. A great basic business lesson.</p>
