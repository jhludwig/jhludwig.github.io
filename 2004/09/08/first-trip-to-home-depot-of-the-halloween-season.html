<p>Best find at <a href="http://www.homedepot.com">hd</a> today – buckets of “oops” paint – paint they mixed up mistakenly and are selling for a fraction of the price of regular paint. Great for my first project of the season – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001526.html">boarding up my windows</a>.</p>
