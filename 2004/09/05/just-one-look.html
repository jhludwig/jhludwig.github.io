OK not that original – an ordinary family’s life comes unwound when a secret from the past surfaces; not everyone is who they seem to be; eventually the cops, US Attorney’s office, and organized crime families are all drawn in. But nicely paced and interesting characters. The resolution is a little weak but still a good yarn, I’d pick up more by Coben.</p>
