<p>…they arrive Friday 9/17. Two containers from <a href="http://www.doortodoor.com/default.asp">Door to Door</a>. I’ll have a week to unpack foggers, lights, cabling, sound systems, tombstones, cauldrons, fake trees, doghouse, coffins, compressor, pneumatic systems, skeletons, etc etc etc. I’ll lose my garage from 9/17 til late November as it becomes staging and workspace for props.</p>

<p>This year – I’ll add some more tombstones, and probably a few more pneumatic effects.</p>
