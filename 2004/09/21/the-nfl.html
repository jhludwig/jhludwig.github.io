      <td>Gadgetopia](http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/09/19/ComputersInTheNFL.html “Computers in the NFL</td>
      <td>Gadgetopia”) – there is a lot of science involved in the game. Also a great pullout section in yesterday’s WSJ on the state of the NFL – why it has been successful to date (versus the other pro leagues) and the upcoming economic stresses on the league. Wish I could link to it but it is behind the WSJ sub wall. Worth reading if you can get your hands on it tho, there is a point of view that the days of revenue-sharing are ending, and the league faces the risk of becoming more like MLB or the NBA.</td>
