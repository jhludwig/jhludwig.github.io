<p>I’ve been goaded again to look at <a href="http://www.edtrustfund.org/about_i_884/index.html" title="I-884: The Education Initiative">I-884: The Education Initiative</a> and to encourage others to look at it. Seems like a very worthy effort –</p>

<p>* Create 10,000 new high-quality preschool spaces for children who need them most * Reduce class sizes and improve student achievement by fully funding Initiative 728; * Raise the base pay for teachers and school employees, and community and technical college employees, to to what they would be receiving if the Legislature hadn’t suspended I-732 last year; * Provide additional classes in high school and support parent involvement; * Expand Promise scholarships for the top 30% of graduating high school seniors and financial aid to keep college affordable for working and middle class students; * Fund 25,000 additional enrollment slots in college in community and technical colleges and four-year universities and 7,000 new enrollments in high demand fields; * Invest in university-based research that generates new businesses and jobs.</p>
