<p>Good article on the <a href="http://columbusoh.about.com/cs/historygenealogy/a/ohiomichigan.htm">historical origins of Ohio-Michigan rivalry</a> – thanks <a href="http://www.connetcompany.com/aboutus/bio.asp?id=30">Mike</a>. (The link on the second page to the alternative lyrics to “Hail to the Victors” is busted, but <a href="http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~dwilson/rsfc/fightsongsII.txt">you can find the words here</a> (along with a huge number of other pejorative versions of fight songs))</p>
