<p>Just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1860648924/qid=1095867865/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl14/104-0293211-2995937?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">this bio of Ludwig II</a>. Probably mostly of interest to folks with my name and heritage (tho my ancestors left Germany long before the events of Ludwig II’s life), but it was pretty fascinating. His patronage of Wagner, of architecture, his erratic behaviour, the plot against him, his mysterious death – a lot of interesting threads. I’m more motivated to visit Bavaria now…</p>
