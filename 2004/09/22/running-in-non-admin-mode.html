<p>Per LarryO, a lot of people are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2004/09/22/232938.aspx">running XP in non-admin mode</a> at MSFT. Some great pointers in his article – <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/aaron_margosis">Aaron’s blog</a> and his post on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaron_margosis/archive/2004/06/23/163229.aspx">RunAs</a>. I’ve had problems making non-admin work on the machine in our family room – mostly when I am at the machine and I want to do something not permitted – I have to dig into this RunAs post. Particularly as it applies to running CPLs and manipulating network connections.</p>
