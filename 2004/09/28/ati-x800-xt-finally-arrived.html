<p>We’ve been waiting for this part since July. Finally arrived – after trying to order from many different sources, it was good old <a href="http://www.compusa.com">compusa</a> that finally delivered.</p>

<p>Installed it last night along with <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/callofdutyunitedoffensive/">Call of Duty expansion (CODUO)</a> and the bullets were flying. Frame rates wonderful. Love the new bigger maps in CODUO.</p>
