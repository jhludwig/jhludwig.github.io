<p>“Lydell Ross couldn’t find a hole on a miniature golf course”</p>

<p>“last year, whenever when ran out of the “I” or offset “I” with a FB as a lead blocker we averaged 5.5 yards per carry…This ridiculous formation with TE, wingback, TE accomplishes nothing…You don’t run a counter as the first play of the game. The point of a counter is that it COUNTERS something”</p>
