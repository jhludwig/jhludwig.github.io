<p>Nice review of <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/09/23/ExpertsExchange.html">ExpertsExchange</a> -- an interesting little community and microeconomy – I should participate.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ethan/2004/09/27#a356">Ethan Zuckerman</a> on systematic bias in Wikipedia, another interesting community/microeconomy. I’d be more likely to participate in either of these if I could crosspost content easily to my blog – I’d like to be building my blog at the same time as I build these other assets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rafer.net/blog/000292.html">Integrating blogs into customer service</a> – going in a different direction now, interesting thinking about how a company can harvest blog content for product reviews and problem reports.</p>

<p><a href="http://jurvetson.blogspot.com/2004/09/transcending-moores-law-with-molecular.html">From the J-Curve</a>, I think steve is saying that Moore’s Law is for wussies.</p>
