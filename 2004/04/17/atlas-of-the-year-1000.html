Walks thru the major political structures in the year 1000 around the world, and the changes that were happening to them. Lots of maps.</p>

<p>Really showed how pathetic my world history education is – history started in 1776 by my education. There are just huge domains of asian, middle eastern, african history of which I am woefully ignorant.</p>

<p>And I’m a sucker for maps.</p>
