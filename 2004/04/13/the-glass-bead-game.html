<p>For my first Hesse ever, I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312278497/qid=1081897958/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-2952831-9460018?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi)">The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi)</a>. I found it to be a pretty provoking read that seems still quite relevant today – certainly a valuable read for anyone considering a deep investment in higher education. And I found the structure of the book (intro to the game; biography; posthumous writings of Knecht) interesting and a break from the typical structure of most novels.</p>

<p>Clearly the book has some obsessive fans – just search the web for “Magister Ludi”, “Joseph Knecht”, or “Glass Bead Game” (I think these people miss the point of the book).</p>

<p>I had a goal earlier this year to read a new and different magazine each week – this book made me drop that goal. It was a compelling piece of writing, and made me realize that most magazines consist of a bag of ads interspersed with whatever articles were available at deadline. OK that is a little cynical but I still think I’ll use my reading time to read more substantial and provoking works.</p>
