<p>p. Hey I needed a goofy t-shirt recently and found <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/">Zazzle</a>. Very easy to create my own shirt, easy to upload graphics, and the t-shirt shipped 1 day later and arrived fast. Great service, good range of products, very easy web-based design tool. Oh and very economic to order quantity 1.</p>

<p>p. I also considered <a href="http://www.designashirt.com">Designashirt</a> and it probably had even nicer web-based design tools (flash based as i recall) but they had a minimum order of 6. But the web experience was good.</p>
