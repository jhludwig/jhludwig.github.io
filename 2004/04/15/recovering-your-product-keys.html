<p>Hoisting this up out of my comments, Kevin points towards <a href="http://blog.kevindonahue.com/archives/2002/10/windows_xp_prod.php">tools to find your existing product keys</a> on your machine. Very helpful, I have 9 machines I manage and I can never keep straight which one has which key. Thanks Kevin</p>
