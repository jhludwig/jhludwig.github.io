<p>Sitting in the weekly partner meeting at Ignition, I couldn’t help but feel that business is booming. I heard updates on a lot of our portfolio companies – <a href="http://www.melodeo.com/">Melodeo – Tune The Planet</a>, <a href="http://www.clearsightsystems.com/">Clearsight Systems – Get The Right Answer</a> (hey they even have a <a href="http://www.clearsightsystems.com/mathlog/default.asp">blog like thing</a>), <a href="http://www.intelligent-results.com/">Intelligent Results</a>, <a href="http://www.interactnetworks.com/">Interact Networks – Proactive Network Scannings &amp; Vulnerability Detection</a>, <a href="http://www.cloudmark.com/">Cloudmark – Your Spam Authority</a>, <a href="http://www.teranode.com/">Teranode – Design Tools for the Life Sciences</a> – they all sound like they are making great progress. Great product work in the pipeline, and good revenue progress across the board. It was a pretty uplifting meeting.</p>

<p>And we discussed a bunch of prospective deals, it is an active market with a lot of great entrepreneurs and young companies. It felt good to be involved with the group of people here at Ignition and with the people at our companies.</p>

<p>Funniest comment of the day – when asked about the merits of a prospective investment partner, someone said ?They have good hygiene and they do no harm.? :) Hey I hope I can live up to this standard as an investor, you could do a lot worse.</p>
