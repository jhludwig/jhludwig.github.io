<p>hmm, this seems unfortunate. it is not clear to me i want a lot of storage innovation on the client, that just seems to lead to more stateful clients, i’ve been trying to extract locked up state from my clients for years. i want more storage in the cloud, available and usable from any client machine i happen to be at.</p>
