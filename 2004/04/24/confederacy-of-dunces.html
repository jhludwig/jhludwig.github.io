As all the reviewers note, this book is absolutely hilarious. Ignatius is an amazing character, I was left wanting more – I’ve been unwilling to start another book because I want to keep the characters fresh in my mind. I thought the ending was a little anticlimactic but how would you end this spiral of chaos?</p>

<p>Is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=confederacy+dunces+movie">the movie</a> really getting made? Will Ferrell would be awesome in the role but after a flurry of news last year, all the movie sites seem silent about the movie.</p>
