<p>As always, lots of reading on vacation.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380780496/qid=1088405500/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-8169749-8319006?v=glance&amp;s=books">Brazzaville Beach</a>. Great great characters, a great story. Good reco from my buddy Tim Velegol. This will stay on my bookshelf. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345434781/qid=1088405682/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/103-8169749-8319006?v=glance&amp;s=books">Gideon</a>. A good page turner, a good way to burn plane/train time. But two weeks later I can’t remember much about it. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812520203/qid=1088405828/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-8169749-8319006?v=glance&amp;s=books">Moon of Ice</a>. Stupid. This is just a political essay, emitted as conversation by crappy characters in a stupid plot. Like the worst of Heinlein’s writing. Not sure why it has a decent rep. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316350095/qid=1088405950/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-8169749-8319006?v=glance&amp;s=books">The Dark Frigate</a>. A great yarn. Won the Newbury Award back when it meant something – nowadays it seems like they give out awards every year, typically to a book published recently, whether there is a deserving book or not. Seems like they ought to wait 20 years or so before they award a book. Anyway tho, this is a good yarn. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451459334/qid=1088406101/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-8169749-8319006?v=glance&amp;s=books">Conquistador</a>. A decent alternate history yarn with some fun, but way too much blathering about how different the ecology of North America might have been if Europeans hadn’t invaded in the 1500/1600s, and not enough insight into the implications. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345430786/qid=1088406262/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-8169749-8319006?v=glance&amp;s=books">Manifold: Space</a>. I’ve seen this before. Average guy stumbles onto discovery that involves the very nature of the world/galaxy/universe, and gets drawn into saving the universe from destruction. Nothing distinctive about character or plot. Yawn. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441011020/qid=1088406446/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-8169749-8319006?v=glance&amp;s=books">Chindi</a>. Kind of like Rendezvous with Rama – characters stumble onto massive functioning alien artifacts with incomprehensible purposes. A little more action than Rama. OK. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380975815/qid=1088406602/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/103-8169749-8319006?v=glance&amp;s=books">In a Dry Season</a>. Good mystery. Something like 10th in a series from this author. Interesting main character, good plotting. I’d like to read more in the series but this one was fine standing alone.</p>
