<p><a href="http://www.shrek2.com/">Shrek2</a>. Entertaining but not as good as the first one. The minor characters drawn from fairy tales are hilarious – puss n boots, pinocchio. But too much screen time for the king and fairy godmother, who just aren’t that funny.</p>

<p><a href="http://troymovie.warnerbros.com/">Troy</a>. Hector the role, and Eric Bana as Hector were great. But somehow the movie felt fatiguing, I was glad when it was over.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedayaftertomorrow.com/">Day after tomorrow</a>. A blast. So what if the science is probably crap. And the political manipulation ham-handed. Probably due to my <a href="http://ohio.gov/index.stm">fly-over country upbringing</a>, there is just something glorious about seeing LA trashed by tornados and NYC swamped and frozen.</p>
