<p><a href="http://ohiostate.theinsiders.com/2/264621.html">Nice SWOT analysis of Buckeye defense up at Bucknuts.com</a>.  Certainly a lot of reason for hope this year despite the many losses to the NFL – linebacker in particular looks like a strength.  DBs and Punter are the big concerns – given OSU’s style of play the last couple years, a weak punting game could be a huge problem.</p>

<p>Next week Bucknuts will provide a similar treatment to the offense.</p>
