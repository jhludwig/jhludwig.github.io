<p>Our phone line is out…The <a href="https://kai08.qwest.com/cwt/repair/login.aspx">Qwest online trouble ticket page</a> is telling us that it won’t be fixed until 8/29 ???</p>

<p>Wow my vonage line+comcast cable modem is better than this…</p>

<p>The really strange thing is that a spurious 911 call was generated on our line the morning it went out. Presumably related in some way.</p>
