<p>Trying to work around the XBOX Live “you have a strict nat” problem. The XBOX team has <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-nz/live/start/connect/router/NAT.htm">classified NATs into three categories</a> and apparently our Sonicwall is strict, which is bad. The xbox site is pretty quiet about what to do about this tho.</p>

<p>Sonicwall has some disastrous AI-driven <a href="http://www.sonicwall.com/services/support.html">KnowledgePortal</a> – someone was taking painkillers when they approved this project.</p>

<p>Netgear has some info that we are going to try – <a href="http://kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n100495.asp" title="Port Numbers for Port Forwarding">Port Numbers for Port Forwarding</a>. We’ll see how that works.</p>
