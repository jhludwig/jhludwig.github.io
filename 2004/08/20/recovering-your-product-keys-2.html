<p>I get tons of traffic from people looking for product keys – I have no idea why this stupid site ranks so high in Google on this topic. But here are some pointers folks:</p>

<p>* Following an old posting – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001429.html" title="a little ludwig goes a long way: Recovering your product keys">a little ludwig goes a long way: Recovering your product keys</a> – <a href="http://www.neotechcc.org/downloads.htm">Neotechcc.org</a> has a tool to view your XP key. * From the same thread, <a href="http://www.magicaljellybean.com/">Magical JellyBean</a> can help you find your windows and office keys.</p>

<p>Beyond these tools, I can’t help you.</p>
