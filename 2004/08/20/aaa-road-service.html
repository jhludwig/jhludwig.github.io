<p>34 miles into our drive to LA and we hit a big whomping chunk of metal in the road – and there goes a tire. Could have been worse – we were right at the Federal Way exit; later in the drive in southern Oregon or central California we might have had a real long wait.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://www.aaa-calif.com/" title="Automobile Club of Southern California - We're Always With You">AAA service</a> was great – great call center, quick arrival, found an open tire center for us, took us right there. Well worth the annual membership fee.</p>
