<p>Seems like I ought to learn more about [removed site] – lots of smart people are entranced with it: <a href="http://rasterweb.net/raster/200408.html#08132004074000" title="RasterWeb!">RasterWeb!</a>, <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/08/16.html#a1060">Jon Udell</a>, Udell <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/08/11.html#a1057">again</a>.</p>

<p>Update: OK I joined and tried it out. I admire it’s simplicity. But…I already have a way that I post links with notes and tags – that is called my blog. I don’t want another site I have to dupe all this effort at. I want something that looks at my blog posts, compares those with posts of others, and gives me the union of all that posting activity – I guess that is technorati.</p>
