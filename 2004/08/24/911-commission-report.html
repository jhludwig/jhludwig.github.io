<p>Just finished reading this. Every US citizen should read it – or at least read the recommendation chapters (12 and 13) – available for download at <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm" title="National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States">National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States</a>.</p>

<p>Reading it makes me feel much more activist about the problem. And much more realistic about the time it is going to take to overcome the terrorism problem – the book mentions that we should think in terms of decades.</p>
