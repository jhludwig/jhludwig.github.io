<p>OK I’ll go further, it was a very entertaining travelogue period. Gimlette has a good dry style, which is needed for book about a country with such a tragicomic history. Paraguay seems to have a pretty unfair share of misadventures, some of its own making, and sometimes buffetted by outside forces.</p>

<p>During this election season, everytime you worry about our system of government – pick up this book and read a chapter or two. You will feel better.</p>
