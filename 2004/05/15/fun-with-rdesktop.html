<p>I’ve been playing around with the remote desktop feature in XP.  I have to say, within the house, between XP machines, it works pretty well.  Good perf, very little latency, pretty good rendering.</p>

<p>I also tried using the Rdesktop tool in Knoppix against my XP machine.  It did work with a little more trouble (you can’t just enter a “netbios” name, you have to address the remote machine using it’s IP address).  It has some rendering problems – odd color matching, fonts don’t look as nice, etc.  But it works. </p>

<p>For extra credit I fired up my vpn client and connected to work, and then opened up an XP-to-XP remote desktop session.  Then from another machine running Knoppix in the house, I rdesktop’d to the XP machine in the house.  And yes you can daisychain these sessions.  Rendering became really funky at this point however. </p>

<p>I’ve read several places online that people recommend <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">VNC</a> in place of rdesktop.  If I get in the practice of doing remote control frequently from a linux box i will have to try this out.</p>
