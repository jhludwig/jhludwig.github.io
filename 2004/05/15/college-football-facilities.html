<p>Kevin posts that <a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/acc/archives/001028.php">Facilities are the new ACC battleground</a>.  Facilities, along with staff, are the great unregulated expense items left to college football programs.  You can’t stock up on players due to scholarship limits, you can’t pay players.  But you can spend boatloads of money on first class facilities which are a significant recruiting draw.  And you can spend boatloads on staff which can provide a significantly better level of service for potential recruits and current players. </p>

<p>The leadership programs in the ACC, SEC, and Big10 are all spending significantly in these areas.  I don’t know much about the Big-12 but I’d guess they are there to.  Now go back to my <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001341.html">earlier post about Pac-10 budgets</a> – the Pac-10 seems to have a real budget shortfall, the schools are going to have to take large steps to remain competitive.</p>
