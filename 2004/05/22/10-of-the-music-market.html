<p>I draw two conclusions:</p>

<p>* People want their music mobile. Fixed location music is worth a lot less than mobile music. * People love to express themselves thru customization – ringtones, custom engraving on ipods, faceplates, themes for blogs, etc. Never underestimate the demand for this.</p>
