<p>First we have the <a href="http://www.gadgets-weblog.com/archives/location_free_tv.html" title="The Gadgets Weblog ">wireless broadband tv</a> – tv over wireless IP.</p>

<p>Combine with <a href="http://www.lostremote.com/archives/001207.html">broadcast tv downloading</a> which is exploding.</p>

<p>Seems like we are at the tipping point – analog tv sales could absolutely collapse in the next 5 years as people flip en masse to PCs and other digital devices. I think this could happen faster than we realize – will the current generation of college students ever buy a regular TV?</p>
