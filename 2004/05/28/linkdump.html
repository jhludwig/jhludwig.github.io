<p>* <a href="http://www.geekdiy.com/phpn/index.php" title="geekdiy.com">geekdiy.com</a> – great site for fun geek projects. * “SID in Seattle”:http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1602357,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532. Crap how did I miss this, this would have been fun to attend. * “Brian analyzes traffic trends”: http://www.brianstorms.com/archives/000365.html. Perhaps the web is becoming less US-centric? * “Paul recommends FarCry again”:http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_05_23_archive.htm#108575101479230876. The problem with this game is that it ruins you for other games, nothing else measures up. * In the comments of this post, some “good links to torrent seed sites”:http://feeds.feedburner.com/AVc?m=141 * “Tech info on some current hack techniques”:http://www.iunknown.com/000449.html. The rootkit site is fascinating, I had no idea it was that trivial to hide processes from task manager. * “Simson finds a good history fo computers”:http://www.simson.net/blog/archives/000090.php. * “Lockergnome points to Yahoo toolbar beta”:http://channels.lockergnome.com/news/archives/010502.phtml. I’ve installed this on all my machines, the free spyware detector is very worthy. * “Ed points to info on word tracker”:http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000611.html. Basically you can’t open a word document and have an expectation of privacy. * “Windows Server 2003 R2”:http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7173. Despite MSFT’s protestations it sure seems to me that VPNs are a dying technology. * “Jon Udell on partial trust”:http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/05/24.html#a1007. Very common problem in the home. Will be interesting to see how XP SP2 improves. * “Advice to Tivo”:http://www.engadget.com/entry/3611628962873617/. Seems wise, Tivo has a great UI, but it is trapped on a box that is available only to some people in some households.</p>
