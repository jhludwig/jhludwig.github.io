<p>* <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/03/2244203">Knoppix v3.4</a> out. Downloading now via bittorrent. Good article <a href="http://www.shockfamily.net/cedric/knoppix/">here</a> on using Knoppix in disaster scenarios. * <a href="http://www.internet-nexus.com/2004_05_02_archive.htm#108370079196609981">Java Desktop System V2</a> out. Somewhat intriguing but I am not willing to shell out $50/year to try it. Sun really needs a cheaper license for personal/educational/developer use. Otherwise everyone is going to be using Knoppix and its kin, or Longhorn. * OK this was at WinHEC – <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1585024,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532">PCI express over external cabling</a>. Love the idea of modular PCs. * ATI responds to Nvidia announces with the <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1583522,00.asp?kc=PCRSS02129TX1K0000530">X800</a>. With lower power consumption and single slot design, seems like ATI will crush Nvidia in the marketplace. * Silent PCs at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/6674704157170114/">Hush</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1894568467945434/">OMWave</a>. Interesting, both Euro companies, is the silent pc design point gaining ground faster in Europe? * <a href="http://postneo.com/2004/04/30.html#a3387">Ewrt</a> – alternative firmware for the Linksys WRT54G – seems like lots of hacking going on around this hardware.</p>
