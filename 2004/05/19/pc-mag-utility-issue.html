<p>6/8 issue of <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/">pc mag</a> has a big utility review (i don’t see it online). Cool stuff I saw:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.ripdigital.com/" title="RipDigital: Convert your music CDs to a digital music library">RipDigital: Convert your music CDs to a digital music library</a> – you send them all your cds, they send them back ripped on a dvd. Sure you can do yourself but this is a huge timesaver. * A lot of keyboard macro utilities – <a href="http://www.cesoft.com">Quickeys</a> or <a href="http://www.pitrinec.com/pkindex.htm">Perfect Keyboard</a> seem worth trying * I really have to try <a href="http://www.stardock.com">Object Desktop</a> one of these days, I see continual references to it</p>
