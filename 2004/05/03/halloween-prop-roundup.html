<p>Again harvesting the halloween sig, a bunch of ideas for prop building:</p>

<p>* When looking for scrap juicers as motors in props (for instance an axworthy ghost), look for metal body juicers – a lot tougher than the plastic juicers. * Use a Fishtank bubbler as source of bubbles in mad scientist lab – cheap and easy! * Lots of folks using windshield wiper motors for props. Some very nice characteristics – back and forth repetitive motion, speed and intermittency controllable. Trying to achieve this kind of output with a standard rotary motor would be very complicated. * How to <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/nc2/CreatureOTNight/demon.htm">demonify a skull</a> * <a href="http://www.boopack.com/software.html">4 bar simulation software</a> – very helpful for pneumatic design * a bunch of <a href="http://www.stuartizm.com/skulls.htm">skulls and skull sections</a> for use in projects. Oh and a source for inexpensive <a href="http://www.crypticimports.com/catalog.html">skulls in bulk.</a></p>
