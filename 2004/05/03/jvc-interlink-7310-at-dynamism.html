<p>I picked up a <a href="http://www.dynamism.com/7310/pricing.shtml" title="JVC Interlink 7310 - Pricing">JVC Interlink 7310</a> at <a href="http://www.dynamism.com">dynamism.com</a>. A great machine for the kind of portable computing I do – small, easy to carry around, but a reasonable keyboard and reasonable screen and reasonable performance. I don’t understand why this class of machine is not sold in the US market, I had an old VAIO with this form factor and loved it, and I love this one even more.</p>

<p>(I used it Sunday at a Starbucks in some crummy little strip mall and was suprised to find no less than 4 WIFI networks available to me beyond the T-Mobile fee-based network. Starbucks has to be happy, I still went to their store and bought a drink, even tho I didn’t use their network).</p>
