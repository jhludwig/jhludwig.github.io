<p>Haven’t harvested the <a href="http://www.methodzofmadness.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi">halloween sig</a> i follow for good ideas recently. Time to start that back up. Here are some interesting ides:</p>

<p>* Just use a loud bass rumble for a good atmospheric effect. * RIP the soundtracks from game CDs (Doom for instance), they have great atmospheric sound * a <a href="http://www.sprawlingdelusions.com/Projects/Midi/MidiInstructions/DCCSetup.htm">cubase plugin for controlling props via MIDI</a> – Delusional Creature Controller. (ok this has nothing to do with sound effects but i drew some connection between sound and midi) * Dungeonkeeper is another PC game with apparently a great atmospheric soundtrack * Some people have been locating their air compressors within their haunt – the sound of the compressor firing up can give people a good startle – great idea, I have mine hidden behind the house right now.</p>
