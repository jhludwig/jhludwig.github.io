<p>Tong just gave me a copy of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/virtualpc/">MSFT’s Virtual PC</a> – $10 at the company store, what the heck. But kind of hilarious, the box and website are in denial about Linux – there is no mention of Linux as a guest OS – even tho they proudly mention their support for MSDOS and OS/2 Warp.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vmware.com/request_processor?nextPage=/vmwarestore/newstore/category.jsp&amp;action=CATALOG.GETGROUPS&amp;application=store&amp;ProductGroupCodes=WKST4-WIN,WKST4-LX" title="VMware Store">VMware</a> meanwhile is $189 (that price needs to come down!) and has clear support for linux as host or guest.</p>
