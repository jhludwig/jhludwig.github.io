<p>* <a href="http://www.blogjet.com">Blogjet</a>. A nice posting utility but doesn’t seem to deal with Textile2 formating very well – blogjet tries to insert a bunch of formatting codes which collide with textile2. I’d like a posting tool that emits clean textile2 output. * <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a>. Seems like a pretty nice casual editor. <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ad1bdaf7-41a7-4e47-ba20-ca0c3f68d604">Scott’s hint</a> to rename to N.exe is a huge timesaver. * <a href="http://weitz.de/regex-coach/">Regex coach</a>. Very cool, I need a lot of coaching. * <a href="http://blogs.officezealot.com/marc/archives/000564.html">The Ultimate Troubleshooter</a>. You have to pay for it to get any value but it seems like a worthwhile tool (and I’ve always liked the site).</p>
