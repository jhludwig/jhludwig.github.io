Both have a very haunting view of humanity decimated by a genius who thinks he has a better plan for the world. Both extremely sad, Kalki will probably stick with me better perhaps because I read it first. But O&amp;C was a good read too; had I not encountered Kalki, I would have considered O&amp;C one of the best apocalyptic stories around. I don’t really think we are on the path to the dystopia described in O&amp;C but a good read.</p>
