<p>I’m unfortunately at the age at which I need to worry a little more about heart disease and other issues. This week I went to <a href="http://www.health-scan.com/index.htm" title="Health-Scan">Health-Scan</a> and had a full-body CT scan. What amazing technology, what a great experience – walk thru your entire body organ by organ, artery by artery. I’m glad to report my arteries are clean as a whistle and everything else looks good too!</p>
