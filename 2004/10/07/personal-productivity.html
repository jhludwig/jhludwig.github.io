<p>I’ve wondered a little bit about <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001666.html">what the browser should become</a> – arguing for a more task/scenario-centric design. Rich has done some interesting thinking too – <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/guide_to_pcs/2004/10/06/what_is_personal_productivity.html" title="Tong Family Blog: What is Personal Productivity">Tong Family Blog: What is Personal Productivity</a> – a slightly more expansive view on what the personal productivity suite today should look like (since office doesn’t really address the common tasks of today). Good stuff rich.</p>
