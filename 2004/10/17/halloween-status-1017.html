<p>Great progress this weekend â€“ huge help from my dad who was visiting.</p>

<p>All sound systems deployed and tested. All props deployed. Most lights deployed. Pneumatic cable routed. Fog cabling deployed.</p>

<p>The huge outstanding work item is to deploy my dmx control system. Run cabling, hook up all dimmers, debug the control program. Oh and actually test the pneumatic effects.</p>
