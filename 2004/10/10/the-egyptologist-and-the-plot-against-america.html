It is pretty obvious where the story is going, the characters aren’t that memorable, I’ve read better stories about psycho main characters.</p>

This month’s trendy read, it started out with an interesting premise and interesting characters. But the bad guys are one-dimensional stereotypes, and the plot is explained as a typical Nazi world domination scheme, instead of a more morally ambiguous and perhaps realistic situation. I’ve read better Nazi world domination novels.</p>
