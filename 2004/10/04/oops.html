<p>Painful Saturday night in Evanston. Buckeye defense looked confused and stuck in treacle – did the late start hurt? Tressel got outcoached, Northwestern picked their spots and hammered home on them. As <a href="http://www.buckeyeplanet.com/forum/article.php?a=83">Chuck on Buckeye Planet says</a>: <em>Northwestern, armed only with mostly MAC-level players who were passed over by the likes of OSU, Michigan, even Illinois, a slower and smaller Northwestern team stunned the highly-touted group from Ohio - Beat ‘em fair and square in 4+ quarters in Evanston, Illinois. They did so in a fashion that makes me think if these two teams were to play 10 times, NU would win 5 or 6 of them.</em></p>

<p>With 27 points, the team had enough points to win the game. The offense wasn’t impressive – but was as productive as every other game over the last couple years. Special teams were generally good, with a TD on a punt return. But as the <a href="http://www.dispatch.com">Dispatch ($ sub required)</a> says: <em>If losses are learning tools, as Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said Saturday night, the Buckeyes defense now owns an armload of hammers with which to beat themselves over the head.</em></p>

<p>Wisconsin this weekend – it doesn’t get any easier.</p>
