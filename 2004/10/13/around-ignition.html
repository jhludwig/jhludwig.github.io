<p>* Rich and John have <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2004/10/08/new_site_design.html">revved the marketing playbook site</a> – looks nice to me * Andy is <a href="http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2004/10/recruiting_in_s.html">looking for help at Judy’s Book</a> * Rich analyzes what’s going on with <a href="http://marketingplaybook.com/2004/10/13/portable_speakers.html">small speakers</a> – everyone is climbing all over everyone else in an attempt to bind themselves to the iPod success. * Andy is thinking about <a href="http://asack.typepad.com/a_sack_of_seattle/2004/10/indispensable.html">how to make Judy’s Book indispensable</a> – great point – people don’t have time these days for products that are just nice to have – they only have time for products that are critical to their life.</p>

<p>OK there are other things going on as well but these are what caught my eye.</p>
