<p>Martin’s admitting that he watches the Apprentice (<a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/000564.html" title="Deep Green Crystals: The Apprentice Episode 7: Tammy's turmoil">Deep Green Crystals: The Apprentice Episode 7: Tammy’s turmoil</a>) has motivated me to come clean. Besides The Apprentice, we are in love with My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancee (what a finale last night!!); Smallville; 24; Friends; Judging Amy; Law and Order SVU; The Practice. And we have minor fetishes for Average Joe: Hawaii, The Ellen Degeneres show, and The Batchelorette. And March Madness is fast approaching, it is a fulltime job just to keep up with TV.</p>
