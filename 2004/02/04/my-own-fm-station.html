<p>I’m wondering if it makes sense to broadcast my Halloween background music this year via FM, rather than running speaker wires all over the place. Ramsey has a lot of <a href="http://www.ramseyelectronics.com/">FM kits</a>. I’m not sure what the legality of running your own FM broadcast is, even if I just limit it to my yard. The rules for <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/lpfm/">Low Power FM</a> don’t permit individual stations. Sites like <a href="http://www.radio4all.org/">Radio4All</a> give a lot of guidance tho on how to set up a station.</p>
