<p>Adrian has kicked some serious butt and gotten up a weather station for the Lake Union Crew Club – <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/smithsandbox/weather/weather.htm" title="Weather Page">Weather Page</a>. He’s even created a wap page for the camera – http://www.theludwigs.com/smithsandbox/weather/test.wml – my gosh why doesn’t every webcam have this? Now I can walk around and look at Lake Union from my phone or bberry. Adrian is one handy guy.</p>
