Calculus is on my list. But I’d have to put Physics in, probably in place of statistics. I’d drop programming and put in an Arts choice – creative studio work, performing arts ok too. I’d probably just go with one piece of great literature, probably Shakespeare. And now I guess I’d add microeconomics as my fifth. Very tough to choose tho.</p>
