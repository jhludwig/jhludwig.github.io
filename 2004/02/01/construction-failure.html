<p>I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471574775/qid=1075681401//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i4_xgl14/104-0807987-2027925?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: Construction Failure, 2nd Edition">Construction Failure</a> a few years ago after a quake up here and have read it off and on for months. This is a textbook so don’t expect an enthralling story. But a great summary of failure cases in a whole variety of structures – bridges, dams, office buildings, arenas, wood structures, concrete structures, etc. In hindsight all the failures seem obvious; too bad we can’t harness hindsight as a design practice.</p>
