<p>Continuing this year’s magazine reading adventure, my next two reads:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coastalliving.com/coastal/" title="Coastal Living: Home">Coastal Living</a> – at its best, this is a nice walkthru of design ideas for waterfront homes. If I was building such a home, I’d buy this mag and peruse it for ideas. At its worst, the magazine seems typical of a magazine created by an industry trying to flog its wares – the magazine is all about encouraging you to buy more stuff, to feel bad about the stuff you have. There were some beautiful places featured in the mag – <a href="http://www.casamorada.com/">Casa Morada</a> in the Keys, <a href="http://www.shorepinevillage.com/">Shorepine Village</a> in Oregon. Oh and I never knew Ho<a href="http://www.hobiecat.com/">bie Cats</a> were named after a guy named Hobie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conbio.org/InPractice/">Conservation in Practice</a> – A very pragmatic magazine about conservation. No extremism here – just practical articles on small realistic steps in conservation. An interesting article on <a href="http://www.conbio.org/InPractice/article44VIR.cfm">Virtual Ecosystems</a> – I guess I’d call this computational ecology. Another article on distributing risk – creating multiple independent habitats for endangered species. Good guide to wise seafood eating at <a href="http://www.blueoceaninstitute.org/miniguide.pdf">Blue Ocean Institute.[PDF]</a></p>
