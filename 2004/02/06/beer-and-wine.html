<p><em>Should I be drinking wine or beer? This study suggests beer for cancer prevention. While there are all kinds of studies that show red wine is good for heart disease. There really arenâ€™t enough hours in the evening for me to be doing all this drinking for my health. If I am going to have 2 glasses of red wine a day to help my heart and now 2 or 3 beers to fight off cancer, I might have to start drinking at the office.</em></p>
