<p>OK it is not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553283685/qid=1076390789/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-8005787-9107304">Hyperion</a> but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380978938/qid=1076390723//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-8005787-9107304?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: Ilium">Ilium</a> is a darn good book. I finished it in about 3 days, engrossing. I know absolutely no Proust, and not enough classic Greek literature or Shakespeare, but I still found this book engrossing and am dying for the follow-on volume. But if you have never read Simmons before, go read Hyperion first; the Shrike has stuck with me the way few characters (or whatever) have.</p>
