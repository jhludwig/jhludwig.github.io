<p>Looking at PC-connected mixers as a way to augment my KVM based on <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001325.html">a suggestion from a reader</a>. <a href="http://www.americanmusical.com/item--i-KAY-DJCONSOLE.html" title="Hercules DJ Console USB DJ/Audio Interface for PC">Hercules DJ Console USB DJ/Audio Interface for PC</a> – this will let me mix the output from one PC (acting as a usb sound card) with (it looks like) an spdif output from another pc. I can’t totally tell from the specs but software like <a href="http://www.pcdj.com/Products/FX.asp">PCDJ</a> may do this all in software – route the audio output from one pc to the capture interface of the other, and then mix on the pc. Of course at a CPU load cost. I am sure some of <a href="http://www.pssl.com/asearchresults.tpl?UID=%5BUID%5D&amp;waGroup1datarq=mixer&amp;str_Categorydatarq=ALL&amp;new_Submit.x=21&amp;new_Submit.y=14">these other mixers</a> have some remote interface tho it is hard to sort thru them all.</p>
