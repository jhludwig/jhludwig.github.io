<p>Spent some time this weekend looking at vaca property – goal is something a) on the ocean, b) rustic area, c) within a couple hours driving of seattle so that we will really use it and we can transport the dogs there.</p>

<p>Toured the hood canal area and the near olympic peninsula a little this weekend. South hood canal is way too developed for our tastes. North hood canal started to feel a little better, tho we didn’t fall in love with anything.</p>

<p>I had previously ruled out the San Juans because of the car ferry lineup – I love a ferry ride, but I don’t love sitting in the car queue on busy weekends. But I’ve started to rethink based on a new plan – drive to Anacortes, leave the car there, and take a water taxi out to a location – for instance <a href="http://www.islandexpresscharters.com/">Island Express Charters</a> or <a href="http://www.paracletecharters.com/">Paraclete charters</a> seem to offer taxi service, there are more in the yellow pages.</p>

<p>I know it is fairly routine up at my folks’ cabin in <a href="http://www.pointeaubarilchamber.com/">Pointe Au Baril</a> for cabin owners to take a water taxi out 10-15 miles to their cabins, so I am sure there must be a similar level of service to the San Juans.</p>

<p>If so, this might open up a lot more choices to us. For instance the <a href="http://www.wrelopez.com/">Windermere office on Lopez has a lot of interesting properties</a></p>
