<p>OK there are a lot of negative comments on amazon about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385337116/qid=1090793277/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-3169122-2607830?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Rule of Four</a>, but I liked it. The characters had a level of emotional depth and reality that made the story a lot better than a straight adventure story like The Davinci Code. Maybe the action wasnâ€™t as taut but overall a much more interesting read.</p>
