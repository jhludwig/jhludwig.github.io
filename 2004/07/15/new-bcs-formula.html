<p>The new BCS formula is out and I have to agree with the opinion at <a href="http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2004/Columnists/Fiu/NewBCSformula.htm" title="The New BCS Formula">CollegeFootballNews</a> (exercise caution in following link, this site seems to have really aggressive popup ads):</p>

<p>bq. <em>AP writers and college football coaches don’t watch a wide enough range of college football games to be able to cast a qualified vote. Coaches spend all of their time on their game and don’t have a second to spend watching other teams, and AP voters spend their time on the games they’re covering and trying to reach deadlines.</em></p>

<p>It is going to be another controversy-filled year in college football – and maybe that is what keeps the game interesting.</p>
