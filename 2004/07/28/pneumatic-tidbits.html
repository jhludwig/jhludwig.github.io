<p>* SMC part number decoding. I wish I had had this last year before i applied AC to a DC solenoid. <em>The “-5” that I referred to has nothing to do with the negative 15 VDC terminal on your power supply. I was referring to the “dash five” in your SMC part number, VF3130-5xZ where, 1 - 100 VAC, 2 - 200 VAC, 3 - 110 to 120 VAC, 4 - 220 VAC, 5 - 24 VDC, 6 - 12 VDC, 7 - 240 VAC, 9 - Other</em> * Buy pneumatic couplings online at <a href="http://www.homier.com/default.asp?page=categories.asp?dept=1">Homier</a> * OK not that pneumatic but here is a <a href="http://www.scary-terry.com/audiodriver/audiodriver.htm">circuit design for driving something with sound</a> – some people suggest hooking this to “a solid-state relay (110 VAC) or a Darlington sink driver (12 or 24 VDC) in order to switch your solenoid valve”.</p>
