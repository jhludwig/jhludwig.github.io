Kind of humorous to read articles over the last month that file-sharing is declining – sure seems alive and well.</p>

<p>Rich, I wonder how long til someone writes a CD drive emulator that just lays down the written tracks as MP3s on the hard disk. There are CD emulators today that read/write to hard disk; seems like no reason you couldn’t recode the data as MP3 along the way.</p>
