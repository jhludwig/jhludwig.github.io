<p>Stopped at <a href="http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com/" title="PCC Natural Markets">PCC Natural Markets</a> and <a href="http://www.qfconline.com/">QFC</a> today. Not a chicken breast to be found, very little packaged chicken at all. Just odds and ends. Plenty of beef on hand tho. Iâ€™d have to say that mad cow worries are definitely affecting consumer behaviour.</p>
