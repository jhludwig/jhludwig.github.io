<p>I’m trying to find a good KVM with Audio for home use. I’ve started with this – <a href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&amp;Section_Id=201729&amp;pcount=&amp;Product_Id=160623" title="Welcome to Belkin - OmniView™ SOHO Series KVM Switch with Audio, USB and VGA">Belkin OmniView SOHO Series KVM Switch with Audio, USB and VGA</a> – and while it works largely as promised, it has some real drawbacks. The video and audio switching are fine. But the keyboard/mouse/usb switching is troubled – the box is basically a USB 1.x hub which is switched back and forth between machines. And this creates some problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is usb 1.x and not usb 2.0 which creates all kinds of annoying error messages because I have downstream usb 2.0 devices.</li>
  <li>the usb hub introduces latency in kb/mouse interactions which is at time noticeable in games.</li>
  <li>the hub just plain drops some kb input – for instance if you hold down the control key for more than 5 seconds, the hub forgets. really bad if you are trying to select a lot of messages in your inbox for instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>So i can’t recommend this box. I may try the PS2 model and see if it improves the latency and keyboard problems – it may since i think the ps2 switching is just an electrical switching and doesn’t try to get fancy with a usb hub. What I’d really like tho is a usb2.0 based kvm with low latency and no keyboard drops. Google points toward some <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=usb+2.0+kvm">usb2.0 kvms</a> but they don’t have audio. Maybe i should just get one of these kvms and have a separate switch for audio?</p>
