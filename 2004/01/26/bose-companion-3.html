Great sound and the little desktop controller for volume/muting is very very nice. I’m probably going to get some more for an additional machine, though they are out of stock everywhere. (I am also fascinated by how Bose keeps their MSRP up – you see no discounting of Bose products, no gray market stuff, even Ebay prices stay high. They have some distribution magic).</p>
