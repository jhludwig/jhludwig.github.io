<p>Struggling with a blackberry problem right now – won’t sync correctly with Outlook 2003 – a search on error #4198 at the <a href="http://www.blackberry.net/cgi-bin/htsearch" title="BlackBerry">BlackBerry support forums</a> reveals that I am not alone. How long has Outlook 2003 been out now? Surprising to me that the bberry dudes have no fix for.</p>
