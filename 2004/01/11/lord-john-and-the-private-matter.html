<p>I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385337477/qid=1073847504//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/002-7951548-5831249?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: Lord John and the Private Matter">Lord John and the Private Matter</a>to be a very engaging light mystery. Decent characters for a short story, a lot of period atmosphere. I’ve not read anything else by Gabaldon, apparently this is off-genre for her and a lot of readers on Amazon aren’t thrilled with the book, but I felt it was a good yarn.</p>
