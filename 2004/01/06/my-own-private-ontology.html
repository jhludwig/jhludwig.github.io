<p>Here in the age of XML and personal publishing, we all better start brushing up on ontologies – <a href="http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/people/dlm/papers/ontology101/ontology101-noy-mcguinness.html" title="What is an ontology and why we need it">Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology</a>. Or maybe just a <a href="http://www.miskatonic.org/library/facet-web-howto.html">faceted classification</a>, though it sounds a lot cooler to say “ontology”.</p>
