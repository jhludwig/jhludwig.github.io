<p>Way behind on book reviews. Picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0520054628/qid=1075438597//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i13_xgl14/104-0807987-2027925?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'Ang Exotics">The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T’Ang Exotics</a> more for its title than any other reason, for some reason Samarkand sounds compelling to me. The book is a little dry but interesting insight into the culture of 7th century China – makes you realize how culturally and historically impoverished we are here in the States.</p>
