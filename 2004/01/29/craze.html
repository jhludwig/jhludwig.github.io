<p>Last week I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1568582315/qid=1075439534/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-0807987-2027925?v=glance&amp;s=books" title="Amazon.com: Books: Craze: Gin and Debauchery in an Age of Reason">Craze: Gin and Debauchery in an Age of Reason</a>. A moderately interesting history of the gin mania in Britain in the 18th century. A unique voice, and a lot of good period details. And great analysis of the flailing attempts to prohibit or control consumption. Obvious parallels to our own country’s attempts at prohibition, and our flailing attempts to control drugs today in our country. The lessons are pretty obvious – it is probably a waste of energy to attempt prohibition, probably the best we can do is try to clean up the distribution, and overconsumption is probably a social and economic issue and needs to be treated as such.</p>
