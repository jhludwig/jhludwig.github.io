<p>From Mobilewhack, news that <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/programming/basic/mobile_basic.html" title="MobileWhack">Basic</a> and <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/programming/perl/perl_on_nokia.html">PERL</a> are coming to phones. Iâ€™d love to replace my stupid default phone screen with a little script that succinctly displayed the weather forecast, the most recent scores and next scheduled game for my favorite teams.</p>
