I wonder how it resolves ambiguities – for instance my kodak camera dock, when i hit the sync button, tells my pc to sync – which pc will get the message? analogous issue for my scanner. and then the other way around – which machine is using the hard drive now, and how do i switch the drive to a different machine?</p>
