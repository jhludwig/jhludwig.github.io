<p>My <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001279.html">3rd magazine of 52 this year</a>. <a href="www.boatingmag.com">Boating</a> is the largest circulation boating mag in the US – nearly <a href="http://www.hfmmag.com/HachetteUSA/Page.asp?Site=Boating&amp;Page=Circulation">250,000 paid copies a month</a>, predominantly male, median age 46, middle class. While I don’t normally read this mag, I have at times been a boating nut – I had my first motorboat when I was 7 years old, I had my first boating accident when I was 7 years and 2 days old.</p>

<p>Stream of consciousness: 369 boaters killed in 2001, usually people in the middle of the experience curve with 3-5 years boating 50 hrs a year (hey this is way more dangerous than mad cow, why aren’t we destroying boats?)…advertisement for the <a href="www.whaler.com">boston whaler</a> – my teen years boat, what a great boat…some dude spent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3176730.stm">12 days in a diving suit</a> walking the bottom of loch ness, impressive…<a href="http://www.pabst.com/flashsite/ourbeer.htm#">Schaefer</a> is rated the best cheap beer for a long day in the sun…no surprise here, you can get great deals on marine electronics on ebay…Anchor effectiveness is a function of fluke area, not weight..<a href="http://www.mycustompak.com/healthNotes/Food_Guide/Tilefish.htm">tilefish</a> is the hot new dish, tastes like lobster…the <a href="http://www.boats.dt.navy.mil/MACC/">Multi-Agency Craft Conference</a> sounds way cool, the military boat show: Outboards that run on any fuel (even whiskey) – completely submersible outboard engines for SEAL missions – electrical supply from outboards for boat electronics – bulletproof inflatable RIB boats – shock absorbing decking and seating for human cargo – roostertail-free designs for reduced radar signatures…</p>

<p>Overall a good read. A large variety of boating info, product reviews, color articles, etc.</p>
