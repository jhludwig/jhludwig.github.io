<p>I got one of <a href="http://www.cyberguys.com/templates/searchdetail.asp?T1=204+0172">these power/fm transmitter thingies</a> for christmas, and plugged a thumbdrive into it with a bunch of directories of mp3s. It is a very nice little solution, the sound quality actually seems better than my ipod/itrip combo. A couple of reflections:</p>

<p>* Man I wish there was a “bring your own storage” ipod. I’d love to be able to plug arbitrary storage into my ipod headend for a couple reasons – one the ability to upgrade my storage as i see fit (at much better prices than apple supports), two the ability to sync using normal file tools – the syncing in itunes is the worst part of the experience – slow and gets confused at times. * this seems like a better podcasting solution than an ipod. I don’t plug my ipod into my pc every night, i sync it infrequently (probably because syncing is such a pain). I could easily stick my thumbdrive into the pc every night tho, especially if i could then use regular file utilities to create my syncing solution.</p>
