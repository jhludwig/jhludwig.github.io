<p>Rich is <a href="http://www.tongfamily.com/2004/12/16/finding_a_4port_voip_gateway.html">looking at solutions to go all voip at home</a>.</p>

<p>Rich some things to look at:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.pulver.com/products/sip/">Mega list of sip products</a> up at pulver.com * Another at <a href="http://www.sipcenter.com/sip.nsf/html/SIP+Phones+and+Adaptors">Sipcenter</a> * open source pbx – <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">asterisk</a></p>

<p>The problem I struggle with is this – I have a lot of cheap handsets around the house connected by cat5 back to my wiring closet to my existing pbx. If i replace this pbx – what hardware bridges out to all these analog handsets? Or do I replace them (at great cost) with sip handsets – are there any really cheap sip handsets?</p>
