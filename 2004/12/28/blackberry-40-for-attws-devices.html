<p>From the blackberry blog, <a href="http://blackberryblog.com/2004/12/27/blackberry_handheld_software_v40_released_for_att.html">4.0 software for attws devices available now</a>. I’ve installed, seemed to go ok. I enabled the certificate manager feature which may have been a mistake, like all certificate software I’ve ever used, it presents me with an enormously complex UI with no clear value.</p>
