<p>So, with <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/003946.html?wbfrom=rss">Yahoo’s inevitable announcement of Yahoo desktop search</a> – just how many freakin’ indexers are we all going to have to run on our machines? I am going to need a multicore proc and dedicate one of the cores to running the google indexer, the yahoo indexer, the lookout/msn indexer, the winxp indexing service. and then of course all the media player and photo indexers that come built into all these apps.</p>

<p>Longhorn was purportedly going to solve this but now <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9135">winfs may not even be in the release after longhorn</a>, at least that is how I read this article.</p>

<p>So the market for fs value-add utilities will be strong for the rest of the decade – not just indexers, but replicators and synchers like <a href="http://www.geekman.com/blog/arc/cat_Linux.html">unison</a>, <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001746.html">software raid and other lower level solutions</a>, etc. We all have way too much free disk space at our disposal, software will spring up to use it for reliability, performance, ease of use.</p>
