<p><a href="http://www.fanblogs.com/ncaa/archives/002189.php">Kevin says</a> Texas has gained enough points to jump over Cal. Man this sucks, I hate to see the Rose Bowl screwed again out of a Pac10/Big10 matchup.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: sigh. Hey I hear this BCS thing sucks. Anyway, I have a hard time cheering for Michigan, but hereâ€™s hoping they thrash Texas. The politicking by Mack Brown and Texas supporters drove the BCS to a new low from which it will never recover.</p>
