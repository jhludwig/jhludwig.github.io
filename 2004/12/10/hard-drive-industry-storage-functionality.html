<p>First, an <a href="http://www.oligopolywatch.com/2004/12/06.html#a493">interesting article about profitability in the hard drive industry</a> – classic commodity economics are at play, and as consumers we are all benefiting.</p>

<p>At the same time, enterprise storage functionality is transitioning down to consumers – <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/storage/lacie-external-sata-drives-027389.php">external sata connectors</a> allowing really high speed detached storage, <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/linux/archives/20041210_instant_nas.phtml">lightweight nas solutions</a>, a bunch of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;q=software+raid">software raid solutions</a> – but it is all way too hard to use for most people.</p>

<p>Seems to me like there is a path out of commodity pricing for the hard drive guys. The first player to bring enterprise storage functionality – replication, auto-backup, hot swapping, pooling, etc – to consumers and small businesses in a brainlessly easy to use package could be a big winner.</p>
