<p>I picked this up based on <a href="http://www.tongfamily.blog">Rich</a>’s reco. So the first 90% of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-2817119-8833737?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Imperial Hubris</a> just pissed me off, I thought the author was just being an apologist for Osama, explaining again and again the rationale for his actions and the support he enjoys.</p>

<p>But the close of the books was great. Two messages. One, we are at war, let’s quit pussyfooting around, let’s apply the full weight of our force on a focused effort to win. Two, let’s at least have a discussion about the policies that have forced us into war – our energy policies, our support for autocratic regimes, our unflagging support for Israel. Maybe these are the right policies, maybe not, but let’s at least have a discussion and agree that they are worth a war.</p>

<p>I feel a little shamed that I am not sacrificing much personally in this war. Here’s <a href="http://www.windsofchange.net/archives/003234.php">a pointer again to a great post about how we can support the troops.</a></p>
