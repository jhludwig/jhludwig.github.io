<p>* Via <a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20041206_xraypc.phtml">lockergnome</a>, <a href="http://www.x-raypc.com/">XrayPC</a> – another useful tool for isolating spyware and other malware. Also note this review of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/apps/spyware-removal.ars">spyware fighters</a>. You probably should be running a couple tools on all your machines. The free tool as part of the <a href="http://toolbar.yahoo.com/">yahoo toolbar</a> is a great value. * <a href="http://www.otwesten.de/drivesitter/features.htm">Drivesitter</a>. I’m not sure why but I love these tools that watch your harddisk and attempt to predict failures. I have backups of everything important and so a HD failure is not catastrophic for me but it is a time waster and I’d like to know if a failure is imminent. * <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=50">MT Posting plugin for Newsgator</a>. Promises to combine two of my favorite pieces of software – alas it doesn’t work for me yet due to my security config, I’m in contact with Newsgator support. * <a href="http://www.larkware.com/dg2/TheDailyGrind513.html">Mike points in here to PDF speedup</a> – man everyone needs to run this, the adobe reader is jammed so full of crap that most of us don’t need. * Now that I have finished Halflife 2 missions (though am still vastly entertained by the online deathmatch – gravity guns rule!), here’s a <a href="http://www.abandonia.com/index2.php">whole trove of free games</a> * Chris points to <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/16/71140.html">a bunch of nice editors</a>, one of these will probably find its way onto my machines. * <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8355e537-1ea6-4569-aabb-f248f4bd91d0">PortQueryUI</a> from MSFT. Haven’t had time to play with this yet but will soon. * Another from MSFT – a tool to see if have a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=de1491ac-0ab6-4990-943d-627e6ade9fcb">good MPEG decoder</a>. Why does the Windows Media Player make your codec config such a mystery? It is hard to tell what you have installed, unless you grovel the registry.</p>

<p>Lastly <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2004/12/01/273160.aspx">a nice post from LarryO about hiding complexity</a>. This sure feels like the reason a lot of software goes wrong…</p>
