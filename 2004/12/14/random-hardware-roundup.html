Over the next 6 months this stupid problem is going to cause more floppy drives to sell out of Fry’s than any other reason. And many of them will be returned after one use. I’ve had to deal with this 3 times now, pain in the a&amp;$. * Crap I’ve had my ATI x800 installed for like a month now, and I am obsolete, I need <a href="http://go.theregister.com/feed/2004/12/02/ati_x850_x800xl_launch/">the 850</a>. * The <a href="www.falcon-nw.com">Falcon NW</a> fragbox 2 looks like the perform form factor – a lot smaller than your standard mini-tower, but enough space to force in the latest video cards and some storage alternatives. * <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThomasHawksDigitalConnection?m=602">$19 for 7.1 audio</a>.
