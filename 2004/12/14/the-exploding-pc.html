<p>Some great posts I’ve found on the disaggregation of the PC in the home – we aren’t moving to bigger and bigger PCs in the home, but to elements of the computing environment spread all around:</p>

His main point is all about pulling storage out of individual PCs and making it a household-wide resource. * From <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/13/miscellaneous_thoughts_about_exploded_pcs">decafbad</a>, these <a href="http://www.gumstix.com">gumstix</a> are very cool concepts, it would be nice if assembling computing at home was as easy as throwing a couple of these together. * A <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/2004/12/13/on_exploding_pcs_and_appliance_relationships">more general post from decafbad</a> about single purpose devices in the home.</p>

<p>All the most aggressive users of technology I talk to are moving to disaggregation of storage in the home, despite the current designs of pcs which generally don’t encourage this disaggregation.</p>
