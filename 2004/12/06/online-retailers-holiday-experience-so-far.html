<p><a href="http://www.martinandalex.com/blog/archives/2004/12/the_real_winner.html">Martin’s been doing a lot of posting</a> on his experiences with online retailers this season. Thought I’d share mine:</p>

<p>* <strong>Best</strong>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.cyberguys.com">Cyberguys</a>, <a href="http://www.rei.com">REI</a>, <a href="http://www.redenvelope.com">Red Envelope</a>, <a href="http://www.duluthtrading.com">Duluth Trading</a>. None of these sites are price leaders but they accurately report what they have in stock and what you can really get. I hate sites that promise stock they don’t have. They all report status well on orders and let you know tracking numbers, etc. Red Envelope does a really nice job of reporting when a gift has been delivered to a recipient. Amazon has had some site flakiness the last couple of weeks but still has been good. Oh yes, <a href="http://www.shutterfly.com">Shutterfly</a> should be in this list too, they have consistently gotten us our pictures in timely fashion – I can’t imagined wasting time printing pics myself. * <strong>Good</strong>. <a href="http://www.newegg.com">Newegg</a>, <a href="http://www.Organize-Everything.com">Organize-Everything</a>, <a href="http://www.Mountainmiser.com">Mountainmiser</a>. Sites a little harder to navigate than the best, and online stock reporting not as accurate, but good communication and we were able to work things out. * <strong>So-so</strong>. <a href="http://www.Abesofmaine.com">Abesofmaine</a> is a price leader, but their online inventory info is a sham – they claim to have everything but in fact…so they did call me and we were able to work out an order, and it showed up, but I don’t feel great about the experience. * <strong>Danger Danger</strong>. <a href="http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQgotopageZ1QQsassZcomputerstuffreeQQsorecordsperpageZ50QQsosortorderZ1QQsosortpropertyZ1">Computerstufffree on ebay</a> – will I ever see my product? Purchased weeks ago and no communication about shipping status, transaction status. I’m nervous… * <strong>Incomplete</strong>. <a href="http://www.coloradokayak.com">Colorado Kayak</a>, <a href="http://www.watchclick.com">watchclick</a>. Transactions pending…</p>
