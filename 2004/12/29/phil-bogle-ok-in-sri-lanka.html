<p>Traded mail with <a href="http://thebogles.com/blog/">Phil</a> yesterday who is in Sri Lanka I believe for the holidays – says he and his family are OK – great news amidst all the general bad news.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Phil says that Unicef and the local Lions club seem to be doing great efforts at relief, if anyone needs ideas for what charities to support.</p>
