<p>Places we’ve hit recently…</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.supremerestaurant.com/">Supreme</a> in Madrona. Loved it! Great neighborhood place, super service, great food, a calm and relaxing place. * <a href="http://www.serafinaseattle.com/">Serafina</a>. The food was good, we’d go back, but it was very crowded and a little frantic. Good if you are in the mood for that. * <a href="http://www.firenzerestaurant.com/">Firenze</a>. One of our consistent favorites. Not in a very promising space, but great food e.very time. * <a href="http://www.gourmetfoodplaza.com/Series/Restaurants/QueenCityGrill.htm">Queen City Grill</a>. Another consistently good place. Not as trendy as some of the places in Belltown, but always good. * <a href="http://www.flyingfishseattle.com/">Flying Fish</a>. Did the chef just change? We were very disappointed there recently. Every dish was bland and poorly cooked. It will take some dramatic change for us to ever go back.</p>
