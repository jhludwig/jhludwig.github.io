<p><a href="http://www.openwave.com/us/news_room/press_releases/2003/20030915_opwv_reardon_0915.htm">Reardon</a> reminded me recently that I read a lot of books. I looked over <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/cat_books.html">the list</a> this year and was a little suprised myself. And what a lot of dreck in there, I wonder why I plow thru some of this.</p>

<p>But to save others from plowing thru the dreck, here is my short list of good reads this year. Some new, some quite old.</p>

<p><strong>Fiction</strong>:</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312278497/qid=1081897958/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Glass Bead Game</a> by Hesse. 3/4s of a year later and I can still recollect vast swathes of the book as well as particular scenes. Well worth the time. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search/103-6281811-4989432?index=blended&amp;keyword=The+Curious+Incident+of+the+Dog+in+the+Night-time">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</a>. Totally expected to hate it, thought it was just trendy, but this was a solid and memorable story. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802130208/qid=1082873989/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">A Confederacy of Dunces</a> by Toole. Great great characters, dying to be a movie. * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/4770019572/qid=1084987282/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Musashi</a> from which I picked up <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001475.html">my favorite quote of the year.</a></p>

<p><strong>Non-fiction:</strong></p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm">The 9/11 Commission Report</a>. Again, every US citizen should read this. * And while you are at it, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1574888498/qid=1102488643/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Imperial Hubris</a>. At the very least, thought-provoking and internally consistent. * And lest these two depress you too much, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400041767/qid=1091718131/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-6281811-4989432?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">At the Tomb of the Inflatable Pig</a> for a view on a country and culture that is really screwed up.</p>
