<p>For some reason my site is the top google listing for <a href="http://www.exclusiveresorts.com">exclusive resorts</a>, based on a <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001196.html">simple old posting</a> I did. Unclear why.</p>

<p>I recently refreshed the posting to have the <a href="http://www.exclusiveresorts.com">correct url</a>, after being contacted by one of the co-founders, a nice guy.</p>

<p>I’d really love to be a customer, their sites look great. It just doesn’t work for us now tho because a) we have limited vacation times, driven by conflicting school and scholastic sports schedules, and b) we just love a couple places – <a href="http://www.konavillage.com/">kona village resort</a>, <a href="http://www.canyonranch.com/Tucson/index.asp">canyon ranch tucson</a> – and don’t have the time or motivation to branch out.</p>

<p>But if we could, exclusive looks great.</p>
