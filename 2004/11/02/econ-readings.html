<p>* <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/10/tale_of_two_con.html">A tale of two condiments</a> – more than you ever wanted to know about the design, production, and marketing of mustard and catsup. I am not a catsup user but this made me reconsider. * <a href="http://www.beyondvc.com/2004/10/customized_ads_.html">The future of television advertising</a> – interesting thoughts. the one thread I find interesting is the notion of late binding of commercials at the point of consumption – rather than creating one commercial that is slammed into a show at the point of broadcast, perhaps we will move to a model where commercials are inserted much later and on a more personalized basis. Interesting.</p>
