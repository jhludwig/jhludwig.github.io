<p>Been a busy couple of weeks…</p>

<p>* <a href="http://WWW.lostremote.com/archives/002971.html">Comcast deploying MSFT software</a> – how do I get on the trial? Will it work with <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001197.html">my existing fairly new comcast pvr settop box?</a> The comcast/moto provided software is so clunky, I would love an alternative. * Looks like a little ecosystem of <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=16505954-c444-4d24-aa94-475bb26c1c58">media center addins</a> is developing… * <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/7685703146968882/">MSN remote record</a> will let you remotely futz with your media center box…</p>

<p>It’s too bad that it is so hard for consumers to get their hands on all the above – waiting for your cable company to roll the features out is no way to kickstart a market, nor is depending on new pc purchases. Contrast with the <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1719938,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532">Halo2 release</a> which is going to be a huge hit – consumers have an easy way to acquire the product.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: according to someone who should know re the comcast/msft offering, “This is not a trial ? it?s full fledged commercial deployment to over a million subscriber in Washington state. The software will be eventually downloaded to all set top boxes including the older stuff, but I would warmly recommend upgrading to Comcast?s new dual-tuner DVR with HD. It?s a steal at $9.95 a month and if you already have HD, it?s only $4.95. You can order it starting next week”. I can’t find it on the comcast web site yet but I’ll check daily.</p>
