<p>OK the comcast dude dropped by and installed today. (A moment of hilarity as he insisted checking to see if my cable was properly grounded or not – a 10 minute tour of my wiring closet with both DirecTV and Comcast feeds in, and many feeds out, convinced him that he didn’t really want to dig into the grounding issue.)</p>

<p>First reactions – the UI is slightly cleaner than the older Comcast box I had. It is nice that they have hoisted HDTV content upto the main menu, it is way easier finding that content now. That is probably the biggest plus I’ve noticed so far. I can’t comment yet on season pass and other record functionality as I am waiting for the program guide to populate – why does it take so much longer than DirecTV.</p>

<p>The UI style is not very exciting – my 3 year old Tivo box still has a more compelling UI. Is this Comcast’s or Microsoft’s hand?</p>

<p>Setting the TV/Audio out settings requires you to enter a weird bios-like mode, totally outside of the normal ui and control environment, that is weird, and I had to do this as the box didn’t seem to default to reasonable HDTV settings.</p>

<p>Of course the huge feature is going to be recording of HD content.</p>
