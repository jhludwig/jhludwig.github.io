<p>Great weather! Near full moon, clear and crisp, no rain, very little wind. Perfect for fog creation and fog persistence…</p>

<p>Had our first visitors saturday nite – friends. Plus a lot of drivebys that evening.</p>

<p>Sunday the traffic started early – 4pm – some friends, and parents bringing children who were too scared to come at night.</p>

<p>Crush started at 6. Last visitors at 9:20. We had a shopping cart and a half of candy, and had to start rationing at 8:00. We ended up with just a dozen pieces of candy left.</p>

<p>Lots of ?scream? masks. Lots of teenagers with the slightest attempts at costumes. Princesses, witches. Martial arts.</p>

<p>Best props – fog as always, kids love fog. My demented disfigured monk costume, a lot of people thought I was a prop. Lots of tombstones and skeletons. Our haunted talking tree – popular with all ages.</p>

<p>Bugs: Pneumatics good but finicky. Need to invest a lot more in the offseason on testing and construction of pneumatics. Audio – sound quality great but inflexible – discrete sound sources hardwired via speakerwire to outdoor speakers. Really need a virtual soundboard and retargetable delivery over ip, but weather and power present issues.</p>

<p>Pix later this week.</p>
