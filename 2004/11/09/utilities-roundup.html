<p>Since I can’t play Halo2 today, trying out other software:</p>

<p>* from <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/11/02/EditPlus.html">Gadgetopia</a> I found <a href="http://www.editplus.com">Editplus</a>. Love the integrated FTP support. * <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=8817">Firefox 1.0 release</a> – <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/003688.html?wbfrom=rss">irresponsibly</a> upgrading all machines now… * <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=686a7305-a1d1-4c15-b191-55fa4f084d25">Furrygoat points</a> to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=be596899-7bb8-4208-b7fc-09e02a13696c&amp;displaylang=en">MSFT error code lookup tool</a> – as he says despite the title this tool works for all windows error codes. * <a href="http://blogs.officezealot.com/marc/archive/2004/10/31/3238.aspx">Marc points</a> to a new version of <a href="http://www.thornsoft.com/clipmate6.htm">Clipmate</a>. Ok I didn’t really try this one, just posted here because it reminded me of WFW and the mods we did to the clipboard to support network sharing of clipboard items – boy was that a waste of time. * <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/10/30/TurboRisk.html">Turborisk</a> – a free classic. OK the opponents are braindead but it is free. * <a href="http://www.furrygoat.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=07ab2f23-583c-4b84-af25-98b720ffcb25">Photostory 3</a>. Free. Haven’t tried yet but intend to… * <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/02.html#a1106">Udell talks about MSH</a> – this looks pretty cool. I waded thru the beta signup process and have my key so I can try later today.</p>

<p>And I’ll close on a good general point raised at <a href="http://www.microsoftmonitor.com/archives/004060.html">Microsoft Monitor</a> – <em>There is no reason why back-up capabilities shouldn’t be built into digital content software, even if consumers don’t immediately use the function.</em></p>
