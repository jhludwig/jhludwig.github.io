<p>Some recent posts – <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2004/03/22.html#a4466">Marc Andreessen explains comparative advantage</a> on John Robb’s blog. Also goes on to explain <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/stories/2004/03/22/marcAndreessenOnAmericanStrengths.html">what the US’s comparative advantages may be.</a> Per Tyler Cowen, <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/03/outsourcing_in_.html">small businesses are outsourcing too</a>.</p>

<p>These mostly have me thinking about this question: What guidance should we be giving our college-age and high-school-age kids as they think about their educational and career paths? Offshoring/globalization/whatever you call it is going to be a big fact of their lives. Complaining about it is like complaining about gravity; you just have to embrace it and learn how to use it to your advantage. Some of the points of guidance I am formulating:</p>

<p>* Educate yourself to the top of the world. A bachelor’s degree by itself doesn’t cut it. Plan on a masters or phd. Take advantage of today’s higher standard of living here in the US and spend more money and a longer time on education.</p>

<p>* Be multi-lingual. The US has historically not emphasized language education. It might be more important now.</p>

<p>* Consider the fusing of multiple domains in education. In a world where everyone has a batchelor’s, expertise in two domains will still stand out and be valuable. Engineering AND economics, materials science AND computer science, materials science AND law, etc. I know in my own case having MSs in both business and engineering made a huge difference in the number of job offers I received as well as average salary offer – that will only be more true in the future.</p>
