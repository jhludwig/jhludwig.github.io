<p>I’ve seen several pointers to <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/" title="Lookout email search for Microsoft Outlook - Lookout Software">Lookout email search for Microsoft Outlook - Lookout Software</a>, most recently from <a href="http://blogs.officezealot.com/marc/">Marc’s Outlook on Productivity</a>. I’m mostly interested to see if it will help me navigate thru the thousands of RSS feed items I gather each week thru Newsgator – I need a faster way to separate the wheat from the chaff. I’m impressed with the team’s responsiveness – I reported a minor bug this morning and they responded right away.</p>
