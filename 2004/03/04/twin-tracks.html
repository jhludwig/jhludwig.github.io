<p>I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743226194/qid=1078422772//ref=pd_ka_1/103-1212557-3439030?v=glance&amp;n=507846" title="Amazon.com: Books: Twin Tracks : The Unexpected Origins of the Modern World">Twin Tracks : The Unexpected Origins of the Modern World</a>. Gosh was this boooooring.</p>

<p>The premise – start with a historical event, follow a set of ?six degrees of separation? links to a modern event, and show the strange connections along the way. I am sure this is a work of some scholarship. To research and find these connections is time consuming.</p>

<p>But so what. There is nothing causal about these chains. I know bill gates, he knows the premier of china, does that mean that I have any influence over the government/culture/society of china? No. Throw in 2 or 3 more degrees of separation and it is just absurd – my grandmother spent a night in the White House during the Harding administration, can we tie Harding to current events in China. And the stories in this book have 10-15 links, if you’ve played the ?six degrees? game at all, you see quickly how trivial it is to link anyone to anyone, there is nothing statistically surprising about these links.</p>

<p>The booh has 25 narratives of this form, I gave up on the 2nd. Worse than reading someone’s blog.</p>
