<p>Ok i borrowed ideas from <a href="http://www.theludwigs.com/archives/001346.html" title="a little ludwig goes a long way: Adrian's Weather Station">Adrian’s Weather Station</a> and now I can view my webcams at home from any WAP device – notably my blackberry. Very cool. Adrian talked about the next step a little with me today – wire up my doorbell so that, when it is pressed, I automatically get an SMS including the link to my webcam so I can see immediately who is at the door. Ultimately I want to be able to talk to anyone at my door and see them. Really all the pieces are there today – I’ve got an intercom and camera at the door, i just need to be able to route their I/O realtime over IP to my blackberry.</p>
