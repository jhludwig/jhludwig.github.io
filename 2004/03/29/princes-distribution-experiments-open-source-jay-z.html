<p>I don’t understand how the music industry is going to evolve, but I sure love artists that are attempting experiments and not just sitting back and letting the RIAA lob bombs at everyone.</p>

<p>Kudos to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/29/technology/29prince.html?ex=1395896400&amp;en=20da5cbf305c1027&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">Prince for his own music store</a>, I loved his original body of work and am going to have to give him a try again.</p>

<p>And kudos to Jay-Z I think – the <a href="http://www.jayzconstructionset.com/">Jay-Z construction set</a> is totally cool, allows users to build their own mixes. I’m not sure if Jay-Z actually sanctions this work, maybe he hates it. But letting users interact more deeply with the music seems like a great way to add value to music and thereby encourage people to buy it.</p>
