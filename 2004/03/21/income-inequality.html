<p>Interesting study at <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/03/income_inequali.html" title="Marginal Revolution: Income inequality over time">Marginal Revolution: Income inequality over time</a>: <em>War and other disruptions appear to damage capital income more than labor income. If that is the case, a healthy and peaceful society might have increasing income inequality. In other words, if we are lucky, income inequality will increase even more.</em></p>
