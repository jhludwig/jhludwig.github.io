<p>I was reading the <a href="http://ir.thecoca-colacompany.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=94566&amp;p=irol-reports">Coca-Cola annual report</a> tonight. What was most interesting to me was the partial list of all the brands they have worldwide.</p>

<p>* <em>Diet Pop</em>. Now that is marketing magic. Ditto <em>187168</em>. * <em>Bimbo Break</em>. I guess we know the target market for that one. * <em>Diet Almdudler, Drim, Tuborg Squash</em>. Now don’t those sound refreshing? * <em>Beat, Burn, Hit, Shock,</em> and <em>Slap</em>. For the masochists in the crowd. * I knew about <em>Dr. Pepper</em> and <em>Mr. Pibb</em>, but did you know about their buddies <em>Disney Winnie the Pooh, Fraser &amp; Neave, Master Chill, Master Pour, Mickey Mouse, Pepe Rico</em>, the <em>Pocket Dr.</em>, the <em>Robinson Brothers</em>, <em>Samantha</em>, and the <em>Thextons</em>? * <em>Chivalry</em> and <em>Neverfail</em> sound very uplifting. * Combine <em>Ripe N Ready</em> and <em>Love Body</em>, which via a <em>Wink</em>, leads to an <em>Urge</em>, and then <em>Joy</em> – but don’t forget <em>Safety First</em>. * <em>Chaudfontaine, Diet Inka Kola, Guarana Jesus, Jurassic Well, Sparletta Iron Brew, Water Salad</em>. No idea what these are, but I’d buy a can of any of them in a second.</p>
